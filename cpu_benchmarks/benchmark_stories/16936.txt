Ben and Lily were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were pirates and look for treasure. They used pillows, blankets and toys to make a ship and a cave.
"Arrr, matey, I found a shiny coin in the cave!" Lily said, holding up a plastic coin.
"Let me see, let me see!" Ben said, running towards her.
But he did not see the big armchair in his way. He bumped into it and fell down. He hurt his knee and started to cry.
"Ow, ow, ow!" he said.
Lily ran to him and gave him a hug. She saw a red mark on his knee.
"I'm sorry, Ben. Are you okay?" she said.
Ben nodded, but he still felt sad.
"Mom, mom, come here!" Lily shouted.
Mom came from the kitchen. She saw Ben and Lily on the floor.
"What happened, sweeties?" she asked.
"Lily found a coin and I wanted to see it, but I hit the armchair and hurt my knee," Ben said.
Mom picked him up and kissed his knee.
"Poor Ben. You have to be careful when you play. The armchair is hard and can hurt you," she said.
She took him to the couch and put a band-aid on his knee.
"Thank you, mom," Ben said.
Mom smiled and gave him a cookie.
"Lily, do you want a cookie too?" she asked.
"Yes, please," Lily said.
She took a cookie and went to the couch. She gave Ben the coin.
"Here, you can have it. It's your treasure," she said.
Ben smiled and took the coin.
"Thank you, Lily. You are a good sister," he said.
They hugged and ate their cookies.
Mom watched them and felt happy.
She warned them to be careful, but she also knew they had fun. She loved her little pirates.
