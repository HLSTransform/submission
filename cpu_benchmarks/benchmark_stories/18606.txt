Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her doll named Rose. One day, Lily's mom took her to the toy store. Lily saw a big teddy bear that she wanted very much, but it was too expensive.
Lily asked her mom if she could have the teddy bear, but her mom said no. Lily felt sad and asked the same question again and again. Her mom had to repeat that the teddy bear was too expensive and they couldn't buy it.
Lily didn't want to leave the store without a toy, so her mom bought her a small ball. Lily was happy and played with it all day. She learned that sometimes we can't have everything we want, but we can still find joy in what we have.
