Mummy made a fun mix in her room. She put all sorts of useful things inside it. She put in some puff cereal, crunchy pieces, and some yummy raisins. Then Mummy stirred it with a big spoon. She hummed a song as she stirred. 
Next, Mummy carried the mix to the living room. She set the big bowl on the table. She asked everyone to come and get a spoonful. Everyone was so excited to try it. 
Mummy said the mix was very useful. We could use it to make a delicious snack. We scooped some mix into our bowls and added some extra crunchy pieces. 
Everyone tasted the mix. It was so yummy! We could barely finish it all. From then on, Mummy made sure to always have a mix in her room.
