Once upon a time there was a yellow bird who lived in a tree. She was always so happy and loved to decorate her tree with pretty things. One day, her best friend, a fox, came to visit her. But the fox was so angry. The bird had never seen her friend angry before and she was worried.
The bird had a plan. She sang a song and started to decorate the tree with yellow leaves, yellow feathers and a big yellow bow.
The fox was still angry. But, then the bird threw her arms around the fox and hugged her tightly. Suddenly the fox started laughing! The anger melted away and soon the bird and the fox were playing games.
They decorated the tree with bright yellow things and danced around. At the end of the day, the tree was so beautiful! The bird and the fox were happy and friends forever.
