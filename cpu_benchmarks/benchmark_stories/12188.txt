Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mia who lived in a big city. Mia was only three years old and had an eager curiosity. One day, Mia decided to explore the city and learn what it had to offer. 
Mia wandered around the city and found many interesting things. She also noticed that everyone around her seemed very cheerful, especially the shopkeepers. Mia approached one of the shopkeepers, an old man, and asked him where the best place to explore was.
The old man smiled and said, "Why, dear girl, the best place to explore is right up those steps!"
Mia was excited and immediately ran up the steps. When she reached the top, Mia found a beautiful park. There were lots of children playing, running, and laughing. Even though Mia was alone and ignored by the other children, she still felt cheerful and explored the park with a smile on her face.
When Mia was done, she thanked the old man for his help and ran happily back home. Although she was alone, Mia's cheerful spirit was not stopped by being ignored.
