Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was a restless boy who loved to run and play all day. One day, as he was playing, he found a big tree with a small bird on a branch.
The small bird said, "Tim, I want to warn you. There is a big dog near the tree. Please be careful!" Tim looked around, but he could not see the big dog. The bird said, "Listen to my words and be safe."
Tim listened to the bird and walked away from the tree. As he walked, he saw the big dog coming. The dog barked loudly, but Tim was safe because he had listened to the bird's words. Tim thanked the bird and went home, feeling happy and safe.
