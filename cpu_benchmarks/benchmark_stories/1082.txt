Once upon a time, there was a table that was very tall. A little kid wanted to get on the table, but it was very hard. He tried pushing, but it was too tight.
The kid had a great idea. He got some paper and a pencil and started to draw a map. Then he grabbed some tape and marked one side of the table for the beginning, and the other side for the finish.
The kid ran around the table, to record his fast time. He did it again and again, trying to beat his fast time.
One day, he did it! His time was the fastest he had ever made. He was so proud that he celebrated by jumping on the table and dancing around.
Now, the little kid has a record that he knows no one else can beat.
