Once upon a time, there was a big yacht sailing on the sea. The yacht was very shiny and had lots of colors. People were happy on the yacht and they were having a party. They were dancing and singing.
Suddenly, the yacht hit a hairy rock in the sea. The yacht started to shake and the people were scared. They tried to stop the yacht, but it was too late. The yacht broke into pieces and the people fell into the sea. 
Everyone was okay, but they were very sad. They had lost their yacht and their party. They learned that they should always be careful when sailing on the sea.
