Once there was a brave little girl named Lucy. Everyday, Lucy would watch her dad as he prepared for the day. He would get out his axe and chop a bit of firewood. Lucy thought his axe was the most amazing thing.
One day, Lucy was feeling very brave. She decided she wanted to try out the axe. She went over to the wood pile and started trying to chop wood, but it was much harder than she thought it would be. She was very clumsy with the axe.
At first her dad was angry, but then he realised that Lucy was just trying to help him. So he taught her the right way to use the axe. He showed her how to chop the wood slowly and carefully.
From that day onwards, Lucy helped her dad chop the firewood. They worked together, slowly and carefully. Lucy was no longer clumsy with the axe, but steady and strong like her dad.
