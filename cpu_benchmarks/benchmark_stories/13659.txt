Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play with toys, draw pictures and read books. One day, Lily had a birthday. She was very happy. She got a cake, a balloon and many gifts.
Ben came to her party. He brought a gift for Lily. It was a card. He made it by himself. He used paper, crayons and stickers. He wrote "Happy Birthday Lily" on the card. He hoped Lily would like it.
He gave the card to Lily. Lily opened it and looked at it. She saw the words and the stickers. She did not smile. She did not say thank you. She frowned. She said, "This is a bad card. It is not pretty. It is not shiny. It is not big. I don't want it."
Ben felt sad. He felt hurt. He said, "But I made it for you. I tried to make it lovely. I wanted to make you happy. Don't you like it?"
Lily shook her head. She said, "No, I don't. It is a bad card. I want a better card. Give me a better card."
Ben did not have a better card. He only had the card he made. He did not know what to do. He felt like crying. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I don't have a better card. This is the only card I have."
Lily did not care. She threw the card on the floor. She said, "Go away, Ben. You are a bad friend. You don't know how to make a good card. I don't want to play with you."
Ben picked up his card. He looked at it. He still thought it was lovely. He still liked it. He said, "Goodbye, Lily. You are a mean girl. You don't know how to be a good friend. You don't know how to be happy."
He left the party. He went home. He put his card on his wall. He smiled. He said, "I like my card. It is lovely. It makes me happy."
