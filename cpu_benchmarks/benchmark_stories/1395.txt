Once there were two friends - both named Judy. They were walking in a park together. Judy the first stopped and pointed at a bush. "Look at that," she said.
Judy the second looked at the bush. It had a lot of little berries on it. "Rough," she said pointing.
The two friends reached up and each picked a berry. They carefully tasted them. The berries tasted sweet and juicy.
They giggled and grabbed some more berries. They both ate until their bellies were full. Then, they waved goodbye and went their separate ways. 
The two friends had a lot of fun that day. And they never forgot about their special berry picking adventure in the park.
