Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, Lily was playing with her friend when they heard a loud noise. "What's that?" asked Lily. "It's thunder," said her friend. "It means it's going to rain soon."
Lily didn't like thunder because it made her feel weak. "I don't like thunder," she said. "It scares me." "Don't worry," said her friend. "We can whistle to make the thunder go away." So, Lily and her friend started to whistle. They whistled and whistled until the thunder stopped.
Lily was so happy that she could make the thunder go away. "Thank you for helping me," she said to her friend. "Now, let's go play some more!" And they ran off to play together, with the sun shining and the birds singing.
