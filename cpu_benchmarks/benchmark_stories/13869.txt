Once upon a time, in a little house, there lived a girl named Lily. Lily loved to eat peaches. One day, she went to the market to get a peach. She saw many fruits, and she got confused. She did not know which fruit was a peach.
A kind man saw Lily looking confused. He walked up to her and said, "Do you need help?" Lily said, "Yes, I want to get a peach." The kind man pointed to the peaches and said, "Here they are." Lily said, "Thank you!" and picked up a peach.
Lily went home and ate the peach. It was sweet and juicy. She was happy that the kind man had helped her. Lily learned that it was good to ask for help when you are confused. And she promised to help others when they needed help, too.
