Jazz was a hot dog. He loved to run in circles and bark. But, one day Jazz got a little too close to the sun. He was a bit too hot.
Jazz started to cry as his fur became very warm. He felt as if he was going to burst into flames! He slowly ran back home, but he knew there was no solution to his problem.
When Jazz finally got home, he regretted his mistake. He had learned his lesson. After that, he stayed away from the hot sun.
Jazz realized that it's ok to take risks, but that it's also important to be smart. He was happy to have learned this important lesson and never made the mistake of getting too close to the sun again.
