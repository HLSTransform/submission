Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy's hair was very long, so his mommy took him to the barber. The barber was very nice and gave Timmy a lollipop while he cut his hair. Timmy liked the lollipop and the way his hair looked after the barber was done.
One day, Timmy was playing outside and he accidentally broke his toy car. He was sad and wondered if he could fix it. His mommy told him not to worry and that they could go to the store to buy a new one. But Timmy didn't want a new one, he wanted to fix his old one.
Timmy was very careful with his toy car and he fixed it all by himself. He was proud of himself for not being careless. He showed his toy car to the barber and the barber was very impressed with Timmy's hard work. From that day on, Timmy knew that he could do anything if he tried his best.
