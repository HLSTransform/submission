Jill and Jack were playing together in the park one day. On the ground, there was a mask that caught Jack's attention.
"What is it, Jill?" he asked.
Jill looked at the mask and sighed. "It's a mask Jack," she replied.
"Is it alive?" he asked.
Jill shook her head sadly. "No, Jack. It's dead," she said.
Jack frowned. "Let's mind it, so it won't be dead anymore," he said.
So the two of them sat by the mask and minded it. Time seemed to stop, and after a few moments, the mask suddenly came alive!
Jill and Jack were so surprised, they jumped in surprise. The mask had come back to life, and it was because of them! They had used the power of their minds to bring it back to life.
The two of them cheered with happiness! They had done something amazing!
