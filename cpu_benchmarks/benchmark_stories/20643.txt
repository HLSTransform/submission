Once there was a zebra who was very helpful. Every day, the zebra would help her friends by doing things like carrying heavy loads, or running errands.
One day, the zebra wanted to do something even more special. She thought and thought, but she couldn't figure out what it was. Suddenly, she knew! She would kneel down and help her friends plant a garden.
The zebra was so excited that she ran to get all the materials they would need. Once they were ready, the zebra kneeled on the ground to help plant the seeds. She moved her hooves around in the dirt and soon the garden was growing.
Everyone was so happy with the zebra's help. It was a great garden and it was all because of the helpful zebra!
