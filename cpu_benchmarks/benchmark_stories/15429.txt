Once upon a time there was a grumpy old bear. Every day he would take a walk in the forest. One day he saw something he had never seen before - a giant puddle of mud! He wasn't sure what to do. He sniffed it and he knew it smelled funny, but he couldn't resist. He stuck his giant paw into the puddle and suddenly felt something wriggling!
The bear gasped for he had felt tiny creatures in the mud. He quickly withdrew his paw, not wanting to hurt the small animals. He couldn't help but feel guilty for disturbing them. A small, gentle voice then said to him, "It's all right, bear. We can permit you to play in our mud puddle."
The bear was amazed to hear such kindness, so he thanked them and played in the mud. The tiny creatures watched, clapping their paws every time he somersaulted into the mud. The bear felt a warmth in his heart he had never felt before and it made the grumpy bear so happy! He thanked the creatures and returned home, feeling grateful for such an incredible experience.
