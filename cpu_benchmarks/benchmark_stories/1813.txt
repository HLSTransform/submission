Once upon a time, there was a lovely stack of toys. All the toys were different shapes and colours. Imagine playing with all the lovely toys!
The stack reached up high as far as the eye could see. The toys were shiny and sparkly and so much fun to play with. Little ones loved to pick up the toys and show them to everyone.
Imagine the giggles as the toys were lifted up and placed down again. Make believe games were made up and shared among all the friends. There were clowns, bells and colourful parachutes. Everyone had lots of fun.
The toys were handled with care and lots of love. Each one was treasured and enjoyed by the little ones. They were lovely to look at and just as much fun to play with. Everyone loved the lovely stack of toys.
