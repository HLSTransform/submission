Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect pretty stones in her bucket. One day, she saw her neighbor, Mr. Smith, carrying a big bag of seeds.
"Hi, Mr. Smith! What are you carrying?" asked Lily.
"I'm carrying seeds to plant in my garden. I want it to be perfect," replied Mr. Smith.
Lily smiled and continued to collect stones. As she walked back home, she noticed a big storm cloud in the sky. She knew it was going to rain soon.
She quickly ran to her house, but she left her bucket outside. The rain poured down and filled her bucket with water. When she went back outside, she saw that her pretty stones were gone. The rain had washed them away.
Lily was sad that her perfect collection was ruined. She learned that sometimes, things don't go as planned.
