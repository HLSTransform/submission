John was always nice and caring. Every morning he would go to the park and take care of the birds. He made sure to give them some food, too!
One day, John was walking through the park when he saw a small bottle lying in the grass. It looked very cold and lonely. John started to worry and tried to find out who it belonged to. He looked all around but no one was there.
John decided to take the bottle home with him and care for it until he found its owner. He brought the cold bottle home and put it in his bedroom. He’d give it a hug and talk to it whenever he felt lonely. 
The next day, John was having breakfast when he heard a knock on the door. To his surprise, it was the bottle’s owner! John was so happy to see him and ran to give him the bottle back.
John felt so pleased for being able to take care of the bottle, and the owner thanked him for being so kind and caring.
