Once upon a time, there were two best friends, John and Gary. They lived in the country together and one day decided to visit a nearby park. When they got there, a large bird landed in front of them. Gary shouted with joy and reached out to stroke the bird. However, he had forgotten to take off his stinky shoes! The bird got a whiff of the smell and flew away, embarrassing Gary.
John felt bad that he had laughed at his friend and tried to make Gary feel better. He said to him, "It's ok Gary! It wasn't your fault, you just needed to take off your shoes before you touched the bird. That way the bird would find you tasty!"
This made Gary feel better and he remembered that it was important to always think ahead and be prepared. John and Gary went on to have a fun day in the park, and remembered their lesson about being prepared.
