Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved flowers very much. One day, she saw a beautiful flower in her garden. It was pink and smelled sweet. She said, "Oh, what a pretty flower!" 
Suddenly, the flower blinked at her. Lily was surprised and said, "Did you just blink at me, flower?" The flower blinked again and said, "Yes, I did. I want to be your friend." 
Lily was very happy and said, "I would love to be your friend, flower! You are so sweet." From that day on, Lily and the flower became best friends. They would play together and have fun. And every time the flower blinked, Lily would smile and say, "You are the best friend ever!"
