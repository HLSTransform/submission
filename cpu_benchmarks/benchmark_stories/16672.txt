Once upon a time, there was a happy little bird named Tweety. Tweety loved to sing and play in the sunshine. Every day, Tweety would fly around the peaceful meadow and say hello to all of the animals.
One day, Tweety met a mean old cat named Sylvester. Sylvester didn't like Tweety because Tweety was always happy and singing. Sylvester decided to tease Tweety and make fun of his singing.
Tweety felt sad and didn't want to sing anymore. But then, the next day, something magical happened. The sun came out and shone so bright that Tweety felt happy again. Tweety remembered that the sunshine always makes everything better. Tweety started singing again, and this time, all of the animals joined in. Sylvester saw how happy Tweety was and felt bad for teasing him. From that day on, Sylvester and Tweety became friends and sang together in the sunshine every day.
