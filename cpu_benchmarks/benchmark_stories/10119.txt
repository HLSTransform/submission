Lily and Ben were playing with clay. They liked to make different shapes and animals with the clay. They had red, blue, yellow and green clay. Lily decided to make a flower with red and yellow clay. Ben decided to make a snake with green and blue clay.
Lily rolled the red clay into a ball and then flattened it. She made six petals with the yellow clay and stuck them around the ball. She made a stem with green clay and a leaf with blue clay. She was happy with her flower. She showed it to Ben.
Ben rolled the green clay into a long rope and twisted it. He made a head with blue clay and two eyes with red clay. He made a tongue with yellow clay and stuck it out of the mouth. He was happy with his snake. He showed it to Lily.
Lily looked at the snake and felt frightened. She did not like snakes. She thought they were scary and dangerous. She screamed and ran away from the snake. She dropped her flower on the floor.
Ben looked at Lily and felt sad. He did not mean to scare her. He liked snakes. He thought they were cool and fun. He did not understand why Lily was afraid of his snake. He picked up her flower and followed her.
He found Lily hiding behind the sofa. He said, "Lily, I'm sorry. I did not want to scare you. I like your flower. It is pretty and colorful. Do you want to see my snake? It is not real. It is just clay. It has a soft texture. You can touch it if you want."
Lily peeked out from behind the sofa. She saw Ben holding her flower and his snake. She saw that the snake was not real. It was just clay. She felt curious about the snake. She said, "Ben, thank you. I like your snake. It is cool and fun. Can I touch it?"
Ben smiled and nodded. He gave her the flower and the snake. Lily touched the snake and felt its texture. It was soft and smooth. She was not frightened anymore. She smiled and said, "Ben, you are a good friend. Can we play with clay together?"
Ben hugged her and said, "Yes, we can. We can make more shapes and animals with clay. We can share and learn from each other. We can have fun together."
Lily and Ben learned that they can like different things and still be friends. They learned that they can respect and appreciate each other's choices. They learned that they can overcome their fears and try new things. They learned that they can play with clay together.
