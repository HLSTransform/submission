Once upon a time, there was a box of crayons. The crayons were very organized. They were all in a row, like a rainbow. The crayons liked to color pictures for kids. They were happy when kids used them.
One day, a new crayon came to the box. The new crayon did not have a name. The other crayons wanted to help the new crayon. They all thought of a name for the new crayon. They picked a name that was fun and happy.
The new crayon liked the name. The name was "Sunshine". Sunshine was a pretty yellow color. Now, Sunshine could color pictures with the other crayons. They all had fun together. And the kids loved the pictures they made.
