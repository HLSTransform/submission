Once there was a sailor. He discovered a peaceful island. On this island there were so many animals and plants. He saw monkeys swinging from the trees and colourful parrots flying around. The sailor was so excited to explore this new place and he kept going further.
Then he saw a beach, with clear blue water. He decided to go for a swim and he moved closer to the shore. He could see so many different sea creatures like fish, turtles and crabs. The sailor was amazed by the beauty of the ocean and he wanted to stay there for a long time.
After swimming, the sailor discovered a cove. He stepped inside and saw a beautiful sight. Big rocks were sitting in the middle of the cove, surrounded by sand. On top of the rocks there were colourful birds, singing and enjoying the peaceful surroundings. The sailor was very happy and he knew this was a special place.
He stayed there for a long time, discovering all the wonderful things on the peaceful island.
