Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a yellow raven perched on a tree branch. "Wow, a yellow bird!" she said to herself.
Lily tried to get closer to the raven, but it flew away. "Come back, birdie!" she shouted. Suddenly, she saw a big stick on the ground. She picked it up and waved it around. "Maybe I can remove the bird from the tree with this stick," she said.
Just then, her mom came outside and asked, "What are you doing, Lily?" Lily explained about the yellow raven and her plan to remove it from the tree. Her mom laughed and said, "Oh, Lily, ravens don't like to be bothered. Let's just watch it from a distance and enjoy its beauty." So they sat together and watched the yellow raven fly away into the sky.
