Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Jenny. Jenny loved pink and was very creative. She loved playing sports with her friends and dreamed of being a famous athlete one day.
One day while she was practicing, Jenny saw two birds flying in the sky. She thought to herself, “I wonder what it would be like to marry a bird?”
Just then, a pink bird flew down and said to Jenny: “Marry me!” Jenny was so surprised that a bird was talking to her. She said, “Why do you want to marry me?” 
The bird replied, “I think you’re very brave and you’re really good at sports. I want us to play together all the time!” Jenny thought it was a great idea, so she said “Yes!” 
The bird and Jenny got married and had lots of fun together playing all kinds of sports. They were very happy and Jenny’s dream finally came true.
