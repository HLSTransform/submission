Mama was helping Tom organize his blocks. He was so excited she was there to help him. Tom looked out the window and saw his neighbor in her garden. Mama asked him what he was doing. 
Tom said, "I'm going to ask my neighbor if she needs help organizing her garden." Mama said, "That's a great idea Tom! Go and ask her." 
Tom rushed outside. He got to his neighbor's garden and said, "Hi neighbor! Do you need help organizing your garden?" His neighbor looked up at him, smiled and said, "Why, yes I do! Would you like to help me?" 
Tom was so excited. He said, "Yes! I can help you." His neighbor was a little impatient, so she showed him what she needed done. 
Tom worked hard and organized her garden for her. When he was done, his neighbor said, "Thank you Tom, you did a great job!" He smiled, feeling proud of himself and said, "You're welcome neighbor!"
