Once there was a bear who wanted to play soccer. He rolled the ball along the ground with his feet. Soon he found a goal and began to play. 
He rolled the ball back and forth and felt so happy. But then a rabbit came by. The bear was excited and asked the rabbit if he wanted to play too.
The rabbit said, "Yes!" He rolled the ball into the goal and cheered. But the bear was upset. He felt the goal was his and he felt guilty.
He shouted at the rabbit, "No! That's my goal!" Then he rolled the ball away from the rabbit and left.
The rabbit was sad. He thought it was wrong for the bear to take the ball away from him.
Moral of the story: Everyone should be generous and friendly, not selfish and angry.
