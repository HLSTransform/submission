Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived an obedient rhinoceros named Remy. Remy had many friends, but his best friend was a little bird named Benny. They loved to play together all day long.
One morning, Benny flew to Remy's side to wake him up. "Remy, Remy, wake up! It's time to play!" Benny chirped. Remy opened his big eyes and smiled at his friend. "Okay, Benny, let's play!" he said.
They played hide and seek, and tag, and had so much fun. They laughed and ran until the sun went down. At the end of the day, Remy and Benny were very tired. They said goodnight to each other and went to sleep, knowing they would wake up and play again the next day.
