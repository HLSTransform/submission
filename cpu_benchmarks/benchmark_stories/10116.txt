Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play outside. One day, it was very cold and windy. Lily's mom said, "You can play outside, but you have to wear your hats and coats. And don't go too far from the house." Lily and Ben said, "OK, mom."
They put on their hats and coats and went outside. They saw some snow on the ground and decided to make a snowman. They rolled big balls of snow and stacked them on top of each other. They found some sticks for the arms, a carrot for the nose, and some stones for the eyes and mouth. They were very proud of their snowman.
They wanted to show their snowman to Lily's mom, so they ran back to the house. But when they got there, they saw that the door was locked. They knocked and knocked, but no one answered. They felt scared and cold. They wondered where Lily's mom was.
Then they heard a voice from the window. It was Lily's mom. She said, "I'm sorry, kids. I had to go to the store for a few minutes. I forgot to leave the door open for you. I'll be back soon. Can you wait for me?"
Lily and Ben said, "Yes, mom. We can wait for you. But we are very cold. Can we tell you a story to keep warm?"
Lily's mom said, "Sure, you can tell me a story. What is your story about?"
Lily and Ben said, "Our story is about our snowman. He is very nice and friendly. He likes to play with us and make us laugh. He is our best friend."
Lily's mom said, "That sounds like a wonderful story. I can't wait to hear it. And I can't wait to see your snowman. He sounds very special. You are very creative and kind, kids. I'm proud of you."
Lily and Ben smiled and started to tell their story. They felt warmer and happier. They learned that stories can make them feel better when they are cold and lonely. And they learned to listen to their mom and stay close to the house. They knew that their mom loved them and would always come back for them.
