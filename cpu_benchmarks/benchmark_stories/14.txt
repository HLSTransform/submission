Once upon a time, there was a pirate named Tom. Tom was an honest pirate who always told the truth. One day, Tom found a treasure map. He decided to look for the treasure with his friend, Sam.
Tom and Sam sailed on their boat. They followed the map and found an island. On the island, they saw a big, scary pirate named Max. Max wanted the treasure too. Tom said, "Max, we found the treasure first. Please let us have it."
Max did not want to give up. But Tom and Sam were brave. They told Max, "If you surrender and stop fighting, we can share the treasure with you." Max thought about it and agreed. They all worked together to find the treasure.
In the end, Tom, Sam, and Max found the treasure and shared it. They learned that being honest and working together is better than fighting. And they all became good friends.
