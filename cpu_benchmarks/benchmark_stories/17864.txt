John was walking down the street when he noticed a coin on the ground. He bent down to pick it up. He saw that it was broken in half. He wanted to fix it, so he put the pieces together. He smiled as he saw it was back all in one piece. He was happy to have the coin and put it in his pocket. 
John kept walking and noticed something else. It was a bird that had a broken wing. It was sitting on the ground, so John carefully picked it up. He saw that the wing was almost healed. He held the bird in his hands and smiled. Then, he gently released the bird back into the air and watched it fly away. 
John was glad he had noticed the coin and the bird. He learned that anything can be put back together no matter how broken it was.
