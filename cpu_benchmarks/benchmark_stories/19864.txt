Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to drive his toy car around the house. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean his room, but he didn't want to. He decided to drive his car instead. 
As he drove his car, he accidentally bumped into his mom's vase and it fell and broke. Timmy was in trouble. He felt sorry and tried to clean up the mess, but it was too late. His mom was very upset with him. 
Timmy learned that driving his car when he was supposed to be cleaning his room caused trouble. He promised to be more careful next time. But unfortunately, he never got the chance to make it up to his mom because later that day, he got sick and had to go to the hospital.
