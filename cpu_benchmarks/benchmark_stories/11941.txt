Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean his room. Timmy didn't want to clean his room, but he knew it was important to listen to his mom. So, he cleaned his room and it looked much better.
The next day, Timmy went to school. His teacher, Miss Lisa, taught him math. Timmy liked math because he liked counting and adding numbers. He was good at it too! After class, Miss Lisa told Timmy that he was an honest boy. Timmy felt proud because he knew that being honest was a good thing.
When Timmy went home, he told his mom about what Miss Lisa said. His mom was happy to hear that Timmy was doing well in school and being honest. Timmy felt happy too because he knew that he was doing the right thing by cleaning his room and being honest in school.
