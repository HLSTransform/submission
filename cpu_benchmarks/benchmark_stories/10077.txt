Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys. They have a big case with many toys inside. They open the case and look for their favorite toys.
Lily sees a doll with long hair and a pink dress. She says, "This is my toy. I want to play with it." She takes the doll and hugs it.
Ben sees a car with four wheels and a red color. He says, "This is my toy. I want to play with it." He takes the car and makes it go vroom.
But then they see that there is only one toy left in the case. It is a ball with many colors. It is not a very ordinary toy. It can bounce and roll and make funny sounds.
Lily and Ben both want the ball. They say, "This is my toy. I want to play with it." They reach for the ball at the same time. They pull the ball from each other. They disagree.
They start to cry and shout. They are not happy. They are not friends.
Then they hear a voice. It is Mom. She says, "What is going on here? Why are you crying and shouting? Why are you not sharing your toys?"
Lily and Ben stop crying and shouting. They look at Mom. They look at each other. They feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We are sorry, friend. We were not nice. We were not sharing. We can share the ball. We can take turns. We can play together."
Mom smiles. She says, "That is good. I am glad you are sorry. I am glad you are nice. I am glad you are sharing. You can play with the ball. You can play with the doll and the car. You can play with all the toys. You can have fun. You can be friends."
Lily and Ben smile. They say, "Thank you, Mom. Thank you, friend. We are happy. We are friends. We will play with the ball. We will play with the doll and the car. We will play with all the toys. We will have fun. We will be friends."
They hug Mom. They hug each other. They play with the toys. They are happy. They are friends. The end.
