Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in the rain. One day, he put on his heavy boots and went outside to play. He splashed in puddles and danced in the rain. But then, his mom called him inside for lunch. Tim didn't want to leave his fun outside, but he knew he had to go in. So, he took off his wet boots and left them by the door. After lunch, Tim went back outside to play some more, but his boots were too heavy to put back on. So, he ran around barefoot and had just as much fun. The end.
