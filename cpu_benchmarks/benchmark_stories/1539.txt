Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved sweets and pastries. One day, she went to the bakery with her mom. She saw a yummy pastry and asked her mom if she could have it. Her mom said yes and bought it for her.
Lily took a big bite of the pastry, but it tasted bad. She made a face and said, "Mommy, this pastry tastes bad. Can I have a different one?" Her mom said, "Of course, let's go pick out a different pastry."
Lily picked out a chocolate pastry and it tasted much better. She smiled and said, "This pastry is yummy! Thank you, mommy." Her mom replied, "You're welcome, Lily. I'm glad you like it." And they lived happily ever after, enjoying delicious pastries together.
