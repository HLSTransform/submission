Once upon a time, there was a big bear named Benny. Benny loved to eat honey from the beehive. One day, Benny found out that he had a cavity in his tooth. His friend, a wise owl named Ollie, told him that eating too much honey was not good for his teeth. Ollie suggested that Benny should eat more minerals to prevent cavities.
Benny asked, "What are minerals?" 
Ollie replied, "Minerals are things like rocks and stones that are good for your body."
Benny listened to Ollie's advice and started eating more minerals like rocks and stones. He also ate less honey and his cavity went away. Benny was happy and thanked Ollie for his help.
