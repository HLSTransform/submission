One day, Mommy and Daddy said they needed to go to a meeting. They took Mary and they loaded the car with their things. Mary was so excited to go on a trip and she saw a pink car outside. She asked Daddy if she could go too, and he said yes. 
When they got to the meeting, everyone was dressed so nicely. The room was full of pink decorations and it looked so pretty. Mary sat in a corner and watched the grown-ups talk.
When the meeting was over, Daddy and Mommy loaded the car again and they took Mary home. She was so tired from all the excitement that she fell asleep on the way home. 
When she woke up, she was home and she knew it had all been an exciting adventure.
