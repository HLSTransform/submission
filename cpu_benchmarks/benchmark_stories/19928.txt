Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. One day, he saw a toy train that he really wanted. The train was very cheap, so Timmy asked his mom if he could buy it. 
His mom said, "No, Timmy. We don't have enough money for that toy right now." 
Timmy was sad, but he decided to save his money so he could buy the train later. He did chores around the house and saved all his money in a jar. 
Finally, after a few weeks, Timmy had enough money to buy the toy train. He ran to the store, but when he got there, he saw that the train didn't fit in his pocket. He was so sad that he started to cry. 
His mom hugged him and said, "It's okay, Timmy. Sometimes things don't work out the way we want them to. But we can always try again another day." 
The moral of the story is that sometimes things don't fit in our lives, but that doesn't mean we should give up. We should keep trying and never lose hope.
