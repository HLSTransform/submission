Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to draw with her pen. One day, Sue was careless and her pen fell on the floor.
Sue looked for her pen, but she could not find it. She was sad because she wanted to draw a big sun and a happy tree. Sue asked her mom to help her look for the pen.
Mom and Sue looked everywhere. They looked under the bed, behind the chair, and in the toy box. At last, they found the pen under the table. Sue was so happy! She hugged her mom and said thank you. Then, she drew the big sun and the happy tree with her pen. Sue learned to be more careful with her things.
