Ralph and Jack were best friends. They would remain together no matter what. One day, Ralph and Jack decided to go for an adventure. They went to an open field filled with wheat. They were so excited; they felt like they were in a new world. "Let's pick some of the wheat and bring it home!" said Ralph. 
 
So they gathered some of the wheat and headed back home. When they reached home, their dad was angry. He said: "You can't take other people's things without asking them!" 
Ralph and Jack tried to explain but their dad was too angry to listen. He made them go back to the open field and stand there until their mum and dad finished work. 
Ralph and Jack had to remain in the open field until their mum and dad came to collect them. As they were leaving, they realised that they had to remain in the open field even longer, as a punishment. They were very sad as they didn't get to go on any more adventures together.
