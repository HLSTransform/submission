The teacher was painting a picture, with colours that were bright. She liked to paint all day and night.
Jimmy was with her, and he was excited to learn. He wanted to try to paint and make something he could earn.
The teacher told him to mix the paints in his pocket. He thought it was a great idea, and so he did it. 
He got the most popular colours, and he went to start. But when he went to paint something, it came out all apart. 
The teacher got angry and said it was too late. She said he had made a mistake and he should never paint again. Jimmy felt sad and started to cry. He wished he could paint again, but that was a lie.
