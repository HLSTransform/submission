Once upon a time, there was a lively bunny named Benny. One day, Benny met a pretty bunny named Bonnie. They hopped and played together all day. 
Benny said to Bonnie, "I love playing with you. Will you marry me?" 
Bonnie smiled and said, "Yes, I will marry you!" 
They had a big party with all their bunny friends. They ate carrots and danced all night. Benny and Bonnie were so happy that they felt like they could spring up into the sky. 
From that day on, they were married and lived happily ever after.
