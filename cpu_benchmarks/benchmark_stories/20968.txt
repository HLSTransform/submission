Once there lived a powerful dragon named Shade. He lived with his family in a big cave near the sea. He was loved and respected by all of his family, even the other dragons.
One day, Shade's family wanted to go on a long journey. They asked Shade to stay and watch over their home while they were gone. Shade agreed happily and promised to take good care of their cave.
Before leaving, his family reminded Shade to be careful and to never leave the cave. Shade promised that he would not leave. He would stay at home and keep an eye on their cave.
But one day Shade became curious about the world outside and forgot about his promise. Without telling anyone, he decided to take a quick look at the outside world.
That night, a mighty storm descended on the area. Shade remembered his family's warning but it was too late - he had left the cave. The powerful wind and rain were destructive and tore through the cave, destroying everything inside.
In the end, Shade learned that it is important to listen to the advice of your family. He realised that the reminder about staying in the cave could have helped him avoid this tragedy.
