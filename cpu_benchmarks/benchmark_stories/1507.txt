Once upon a time there was a wild gym. In the gym there was a big box. Every day, a man and a woman would come and put things inside the box. It was always full of fun stuff!
One day the man and woman put a trampoline in the gym. Then they put a rope swing and some gymnastic mats. The woman put a big hoop and the man put some tall posts. They even put a ladder in the gym. It was so much fun!
The man and woman then started to jump on the trampoline and swing on the rope. They ran around the gym and jumped over the hurdles. After they were all done they put everything away.
The man and woman had lots of fun at the wild gym. They always filled the big box with fun things and it was a blast every time they went to the gym!
