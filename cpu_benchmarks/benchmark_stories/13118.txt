Once upon a time there was a red reef in the ocean. Every day, a little fish named Mark would swim over to the reef. On sunny days, he would nibble away at some of the coral, and when he was feeling brave, he would swim inside some of the tunnels in the reef.
One day, Mark noticed something red and shiny on the reef. He swam closer to check it out, and discovered that it was an old sunken ship! Curious, Mark decided to go inside the ship and investigate what it was like.
Mark explored the old ship, discovering lots of cool things! He passed through small rooms and dark hallways. But the most exciting thing he found was a big red chest! Mark opened the chest, and discovered inside a large pile of shiny coins.
Mark was overjoyed! He swam back to his reef with the coins, and he knew he would never forget his big discovery.
