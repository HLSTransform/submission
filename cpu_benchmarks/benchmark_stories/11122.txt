Once upon a time, there was a humble house. In the house, there was a bathroom. The bathroom was not clean. It was dirty. The family in the house wanted to make it clean.
One day, the mom, dad, and little girl worked together. They used soap, water, and a big sponge. They cleaned the bathroom very well.
Now, the bathroom was clean and shiny. The family was happy. They all smiled and hugged. The humble house looked nice with the clean bathroom.
