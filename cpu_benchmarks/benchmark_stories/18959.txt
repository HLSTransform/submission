Once upon a time, in a big jungle, there was a lion who loved to roar. One day, he found a big rock. The lion wanted to show everyone how strong he was. So, he tried to lift the rock with his mouth. The rock was very heavy, but the lion did not give up. He tried and tried, but the weight of the rock made him feel dizzy.
The lion's friend, the monkey, saw him trying to lift the rock. The monkey knew that the lion was very strong, but he also knew that the rock was too heavy. The monkey had an idea. He told the lion to stand on the rock and roar as loud as he could.
The lion did what the monkey said. He stood on the rock and roared very loud. All the animals in the jungle heard the lion's big roar. They came to see what was happening. When they saw the lion standing on the rock, they knew he was very strong.
The lion was happy because he could show everyone how strong he was without lifting the heavy rock. He thanked the monkey for his smart idea. From that day on, the lion and the monkey were best friends. And every time the lion roared, all the animals knew he was the strongest in the jungle.
