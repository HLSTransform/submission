Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat cookies, but her mommy said she couldn't have too many because it would make her tummy hurt. One day, Lily saw a big pile of cookies in the kitchen and asked her mommy if she could have one. Her mommy said yes, but only one.
Lily took a big bite of the cookie and said, "Mmm, this is yummy!" Her mommy smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Lily. But remember, we don't want to waste any food." Lily asked, "What does waste mean?" Her mommy explained that it means throwing something away when we could still use it.
Lily thought about this for a moment and said, "I don't want to waste my cookie. Can we change it into something else?" Her mommy thought for a moment and said, "How about we crumble it up and put it on top of some ice cream?" Lily's eyes lit up and she said, "That's a great idea! Let's do it!" So, they changed the cookie into a yummy ice cream topping and enjoyed it together.
