Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had lots of sheep. One day, he needed to go to the store to buy some food for the sheep. He got into his car and started to drive. 
On the way to the store, he saw some other sheep in a field. They looked very happy and had lots of grass to eat. The farmer thought about letting his sheep go there too, but he wasn't sure if the field was available for his sheep to eat in. 
When he got to the store, he asked the manager if the field was available for his sheep. The manager said yes, so the farmer drove his sheep to the field and they all had a big feast! The end.
