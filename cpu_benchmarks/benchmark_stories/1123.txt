Once upon a time there was an ordinary girl with long brown hair. One day, she went to her mailbox to check for mail. When she opened it, she found a letter! She was so excited she quickly opened it up. Inside, she found a yummy treat! It was a piece of candy with a special taste. She had never tasted candy like it before. It was so delicious she couldnâ€™t stop eating it. She was so happy she was able to find this letter with a special surprise inside!
