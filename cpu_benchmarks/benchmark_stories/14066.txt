Jamie was playing in the park. Suddenly, he heard a voice coming from behind a big tree. Intrigued, Jamie tried to see if he could spot the owner of the voice, but all he could see was a tall mirror. Jamie smiled and was about to look into the mirror when suddenly a loud voice came out of the mirror. 
"Don't disturb me, little one!", it said.
Jamie was scared and started to cry. "I'm sorry," he said.
The voice from the mirror softened a bit. "What brings you here little one?", it asked.
Jamie took a deep breath and answered. "I was just playing and wanted to see my reflection in the mirror", he said. 
The voice from the mirror was quiet for a moment and then it spoke again. "Ah, so you were jealous of all the people in the park and wanted to see yourself as well?", it asked. 
Jamie nodded, still crying a bit. 
The voice from the mirror chuckled and said, "Don't worry. I don't mind if you disturb me. Take a good look at yourself and be happy".
