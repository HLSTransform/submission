Max and his big brother were playing in the park. Suddenly, Max heard a loud snap. It was so scary that he began to cry. His brother saw how scared he was and stepped in to help him. He put his arm around Max and said "It's okay. I'll keep you safe." Then he took Max by the hand and guided him away from the snap. 
Max stopped crying and thanked his brother for making him feel safe. From then on, Max and his brother never let go of each other's hands in the park. Max always felt secure when his big brother was around.
