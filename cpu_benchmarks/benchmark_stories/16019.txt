Once upon a time there was a boy called Steve. He was a brave and daring boy who loved to explore new places.
One day Steve set off on a new adventure. He packed his bag and went for a walk in the woods. The woods were mysterious and exciting so Steve was sure he was going to have lots of fun. He walked for a long time until he found something interesting; a pick.
Steve thought the pick looked dangerous but he wanted to take it home with him. When he picked it up he noticed something strange was happening. Tiny sparks started to come from the pick and it lit up in a big way. 
Steve knew he had to get it back to his home quickly. He ran as fast as he could but he was too slow. Suddenly, a giant monster appeared and chased him. 
The monster shouted, "You must complete the mission or you will be harmed!" Steve was horrified and tried his best to run away, but the monster was too quick. In the end, the monster caught up to Steve and the pick was never seen again.
