Once upon a time, there was a king who lived in a big castle. The king liked to wear cheap clothes because he wanted to save money. He wore a cheap hat, cheap shoes, and a cheap coat. The king was very happy in his cheap clothes.
One day, the king went for a walk in the forest. He saw a big tree and wanted to poke it. As he poked the tree, a tiny bug came out. The bug looked at the king and said, "Why did you poke my home?"
The king said, "I'm sorry, little bug. I didn't know it was your home. I just wanted to poke the tree." The bug forgave the king, and they became friends. From that day on, the king never poked a tree without first checking if someone lived there.
