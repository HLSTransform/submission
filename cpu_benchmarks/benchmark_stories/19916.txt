Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a pretty dress with a button on it. One day, while playing outside, the button fell off her dress. Lily was sad because she loved her pretty dress. She asked her mom to fix it, but her mom was busy cooking dinner.
Lily decided to fix the button herself. She found a needle and some thread and tried to sew the button back on. But it was hard and she accidentally poked herself with the needle. She started to cry.
Her mom heard her crying and came to see what was wrong. Lily showed her the button and the needle. Her mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, I'll fix it for you." And with a few stitches, the button was back on Lily's pretty dress. Lily was happy again and thanked her mom for fixing it.
