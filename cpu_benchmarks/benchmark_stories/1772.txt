Once upon a time there were two friends, Anna and Jake. They were playing in the garden. Jake saw a bush and said "Let's shake it!" Anna shook it and suddenly a face peeked out. It scared them because it was so unexpected.
The face asked "What do you want?" in a very loud voice.
"We want to play!" Jake said.
But the face just shook its head and said "No! I can't hear you. I'm deaf." They were very confused so Anna asked what their friend meant. The face explained that it was deaf and couldn't hear them.
The friends were sad that they couldn't play with the face. Anna took out a piece of paper and a pen and she wrote "Please play with us". The face smiled and nodded its head. 
They all played together and had a wonderful time. Anna and Jake finally understood that it wasn't easy to communicate with someone who is deaf. They decided to stay friends with the face forever.
