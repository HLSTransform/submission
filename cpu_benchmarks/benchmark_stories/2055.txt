Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the gym with her mommy and daddy. The gym was a big room with lots of toys and games to play with. 
One day, Lily's mommy asked her to help wrap a present for her friend's birthday. Lily was so excited to help! She used some paper and tape to wrap the present up nice and pretty. 
After they finished wrapping, Lily's mommy said, "Let's clean up the gym before we go home." Lily helped put all the toys away and wipe down the tables. She was happy to help her mommy and make the gym clean and tidy. The end.
