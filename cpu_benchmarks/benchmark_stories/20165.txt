Sam and Lily were friends who liked to play together. They lived near a big temple where people went to pray. Sometimes they would sneak inside the temple and look at the statues and candles. They thought it was fun and exciting.
One day, they saw a shiny coin on the floor of the temple. Sam wanted to take it, but Lily said no. She said it was wrong to take things from the temple. She said the coin was for the people who pray. Sam did not listen. He said he was brave and dependable. He said he would share the coin with Lily. He picked up the coin and put it in his pocket.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was the temple guard. He saw Sam and Lily and he was angry. He shouted at them and chased them. Sam and Lily ran away, but they did not know where to go. They were scared and lost. They wished they had not gone to the temple.
The guard caught up with them and grabbed them. He said they were thieves and liars. He said they had to pay for what they did. He took them to a dark room and locked them up. He said they would stay there until their parents came. He said their parents would be very mad at them.
Sam and Lily cried and hugged each other. They said they were sorry. They said they would never go to the temple again. They said they would pray for help. But no one came to help them. They were alone and sad. They did not know what would happen to them. They wished they had a dependable friend.
