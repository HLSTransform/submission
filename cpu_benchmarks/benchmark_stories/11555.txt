Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to look at the sky and find rainbows after the rain. One day, while playing outside, she saw a little bird who was sad.
"Hello, little bird," said Lily. "Why are you sad?"
The little bird replied, "I lost my way home, and I can't find my family."
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I recommend we look for a rainbow. Your family might be near it!"
So, Lily and the little bird walked around, looking for a rainbow. After some time, they saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky. The little bird was very happy and excited. They went closer and found the little bird's family.
The little bird thanked Lily for her help and said, "You are very kind, Lily. I will never forget you." From that day on, Lily and the little bird became best friends, and they always looked for rainbows together.
