Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing in the sand at the beach. He had a bucket and a shovel and he liked to make sandcastles. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came to play with him. Billy had a shiny new toy truck.
Timmy said, "Wow, Billy! Your truck is so cool! Can I try playing with it?"
Billy said, "Sure, Timmy. But be careful, it's new."
Timmy played with the truck for a while, but then he got bored. He said, "Playing with the truck is dull. Let's go back to making sandcastles!"
Billy said, "But Timmy, you didn't even try to make the truck go up the sand hill. Maybe you just need to try harder."
Timmy thought about what Billy said and realized that he didn't give the truck a fair chance. He tried again and this time, he was able to make the truck go up the sand hill. Timmy learned that sometimes things may seem dull at first, but if you try harder, you might discover something new and exciting.
