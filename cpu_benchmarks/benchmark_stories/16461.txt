Tom and Mia were on a big boat with their mom and dad. They liked to look at the water and the fish and the birds. One night, they saw something very pretty in the sky. It was a lot of stars that made shapes and colors. Mom said they were fireworks. They were for a special day in the port.
The port was where the boat stopped. There were many other boats and people and things to see. Tom and Mia wanted to go and explore. They put on their coats and hats because it was cold outside. Mom and Dad took them by the hand and walked with them.
They saw a big wheel that went round and round. They saw a man who made balloons into animals. They saw a lady who painted faces. They saw a shop that sold candy and toys. They had a lot of fun. But the best thing they saw was a big tree that glowed. It had lights and balls and stars on it. It was very bright and beautiful. Mom said it was a Christmas tree. They were happy to see it. They hugged Mom and Dad and said thank you. They had a wonderful day in the port.
