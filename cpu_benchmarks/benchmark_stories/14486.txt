Once upon a time there was a hunter. He was looking for something special but he didn't know what it was. He travelled a long way searching for it. The hunter looked in many places but he couldn't find what he wanted.
After a long journey, he was about to give up looking when suddenly, he spotted something. It was perfect! With a smile, the hunter decided it was what he was looking for.
He took the perfect thing home and put it on the shelf to show his friends and family. Everyone was so happy he had found it and they said it was the best thing ever.
The hunter was very pleased. He had made a good decision and was very happy he had found the perfect thing.
