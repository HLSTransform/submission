Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to decorate her room with pretty things like flowers and stickers. One day, Lily's little brother Max came into her room and started touching all her decorations. Lily got mad and told Max to stop, but he didn't listen. 
Lily didn't know what to do, so she went to her mom and told her the truth about what happened. Her mom listened and helped Lily come up with a plan. They decided to move all of Lily's decorations to a higher shelf where Max couldn't reach them. 
Later that day, Max came back into Lily's room and tried to reach the decorations again. But this time, he couldn't get to them because they were too high. Lily felt happy that her decorations were safe and that she had found a solution to the problem. She learned that sometimes, it's important to ask for help and work together to solve a conflict.
