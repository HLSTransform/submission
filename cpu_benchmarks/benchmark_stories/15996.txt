Once upon a time there were two friends, Ben and Jill. Ben was always laughing and Jill loved that about him.
One day, Ben and Jill were playing when Ben stopped. He had found something in the dirt.
“What is it?” Jill asked, but Ben just laughed.
Ben pulled out a golden rock from the dirt. “It’s mine,” he said, laughing.
Jill was curious. She wanted to know if the rock was expensive. “Is it worth a lot?” she asked Ben. 
Ben just smiled and laughed. “Come on,” he said, “let’s keep looking. Who knows what else we’ll find!”
They kept looking, and sure enough, they found even more golden rocks. By the end of the day, they had five of them. 
“They’re all mine!” Ben said, laughing. 
Jill smiled. Now she knew. The golden rocks were expensive!
