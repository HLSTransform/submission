Lily was a princess who liked to wear her crown. She wore it every day, even when she played with her toys or ate her food. She thought her crown made her special and better than everyone else.
One day, she went to the park with her mom and saw a boy playing with a ball. She wanted to play with him, but he did not want to share his ball. He said, "This is my ball. Go away, princess. You have your crown, I have my ball."
Lily was angry and said, "My crown is more shiny and pretty than your ball. You are just a silly boy. Give me your ball or I will tell my mom." She tried to grab the ball from him, but he held it tight.
The boy said, "No, you are mean and greedy. You can't have everything you want. You need to learn to share and be nice." He pushed Lily away and ran to his mom.
Lily fell down and hurt her knee. She started to cry and her crown fell off. Her mom came and picked her up. She saw the crown on the ground and said, "Lily, what happened? Why did you fight with that boy?"
Lily told her mom what she said and did. Her mom was not happy. She said, "Lily, that was not nice at all. You should not be proud of your crown and look down on others. Your crown does not make you special. Your kindness and friendship do. You should say sorry to that boy and ask him to play with you."
Lily felt ashamed and sorry. She looked at her crown and saw that it was not shiny and pretty anymore. It was pale and dull. She realized that her mom was right. She said, "Mom, you are right. I was mean and greedy. I don't want to wear this crown anymore. I want to be kind and friendly. Can we go and find that boy and say sorry?"
Her mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "Yes, we can. I'm proud of you, Lily. You have learned a valuable lesson today. Come on, let's go and make a new friend." They took the crown and the ball and went to look for the boy. Lily hoped that he would forgive her and play with her. She learned that sharing and being nice was more important than wearing a crown.
