Lila and Tom were friends who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big animal with a long nose and big ears. It was an elephant. The elephant was very hungry and looked for food.
"Hello, elephant," Lila said. "Do you want to play with us?"
The elephant nodded. "Yes, I do. But I need some food first. Can you supply me some?"
Lila and Tom thought for a moment. They had some bread and cheese in their backpacks. They decided to share some with the elephant.
"Here you go, elephant," Tom said. "We have some bread and cheese for you. But you have to be nice and gentle."
The elephant took the bread and cheese and ate them. He smiled and thanked them. "You are very kind and generous," he said. "But I am still hungry. Do you have more?"
Lila and Tom looked at each other. They only had a little bit left. They wanted to save some for themselves. But they also wanted to make the elephant happy.
"OK, elephant," Lila said. "We have a little more. But this is all we have. You have to share with us."
The elephant nodded. "Of course, of course. I will share with you. Give me the rest of your food."
Lila and Tom gave the elephant the rest of their bread and cheese. They hoped he would leave some for them. But the elephant was greedy and ate it all. He did not share with them.
"Hey, elephant," Tom said. "That was not fair. You ate all our food. You did not share with us. You are very mean and selfish."
The elephant laughed. "Ha, ha, ha. You are very silly and foolish. You should not trust a hungry animal. You should be more wise. Now I have all your food and you have none. Goodbye, little ones."
The elephant walked away, leaving Lila and Tom hungry and sad. They cried and wished they had not given their food to the elephant. They learned a hard lesson that day.
