Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream very much. One day, she got a big scoop of ice cream, but it was very hot outside. The ice cream started to melt quickly.
Lily decided to go to a meeting with her friends. She wanted to show them her reliable new toy. On the way there, she noticed that her ice cream was melting all over her hand. She was sad because she loved her ice cream and didn't want it to melt.
When she got to the meeting, her friends were happy to see her. They loved her new toy and thought it was very reliable. They also saw her melted ice cream and laughed. Lily laughed too and they all went to get more ice cream together.
