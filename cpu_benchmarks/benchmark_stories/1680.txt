Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy's mom told him that they were going to have a picnic at noon. Timmy was so excited that he started to hurry and get ready.
When they arrived at the park, Timmy and his friends played on the swings and slides. They were having so much fun that they didn't even notice the dark clouds in the sky. Suddenly, the wind started to blow strong and the rain started to pour down.
Timmy's mom quickly gathered all the food and they ran to the car. Timmy was sad that their picnic was ruined, but his mom told him that they could have their picnic at home. They ate sandwiches and fruit and Timmy felt happy again. From that day on, Timmy always remembered to check the weather before planning a picnic.
