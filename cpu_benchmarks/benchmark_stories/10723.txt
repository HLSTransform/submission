Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a little boy playing with a ball. The boy asked Lily if she wanted to play with him. Lily said yes and they started playing together.
After a while, the boy got tired and wanted to go home. Lily asked him if he wanted to come to her house to play with her toys. The boy said yes and they went to Lily's house.
When they got there, Lily's mom gave them some chocolate powder to make hot chocolate. The boy accidentally spilled the powder all over the floor. Lily's mom said it was okay and they cleaned it up together.
The moral of the story is that accidents happen, but it's important to help clean up the mess and turn a bad situation into a good one.
