Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Max. He was only three years old, and he loved to play at the park. One day, Max went to the park with his lunch. He had a sandwich, but it was very hard. He tried to bite it, but it wouldn't break. Max was frustrated, so he decided to talk to his friend, Pip.
"Pip, can you help me? My sandwich is too hard to bite," said Max.
"Maybe I can help!" said Pip. Pip took the sandwich and gave it a big bite. It broke right away!
"Wow! Thanks, Pip!" said Max. He was so excited that he ate the sandwich right away. Max had a great lunch and was happy that Pip could help.
