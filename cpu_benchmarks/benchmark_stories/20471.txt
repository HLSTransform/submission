Once upon a time, there was a smooth waist on top of a hill. The waist seemed like it had been there forever, but no one knew why it was there.
One day, two friends decided to climb the hill. Both of them were scared of heights, but they united and stuck together. As they climbed, their fear faded away and their courage grew.
When they finally reached the top, they saw the smooth waist. They didn't know why it was there, but they knew it meant something special. The friends hugged each other, united in their happiness.
Suddenly, the waist began to glow. As they watched, the waist transformed into a crystal rainbow - the most beautiful thing they had ever seen. They knew this was a special moment and they would always remember it.
The friends smiled and hugged each other tightly. They would never forget this secret they had united together to discover.
