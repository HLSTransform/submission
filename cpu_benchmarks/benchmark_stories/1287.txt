Little Sarah was in her garden. She was so excited because she was going to enjoy something new. She had a brain full of ideas.
First she chose to play with sticks. She made a little castle and then pretended to be the princess. It was easy and fun! After this, Sarah tried something else. She chose to make a mud pie. She mixed mud and sand together using her hands. 
Sarah was feeling so creative and happy. She enjoyed the feel of the mud against her hands. Building her mud pie was so easy and Sarah's brain was happily working away.
Once the mud pie was finished, Sarah invited her little brother and sister to join her. They all shared the mud pie together and had lots of fun.
Sarah enjoyed the day playing in the garden, using her brain to think of new ideas and using easy techniques to create her projects.
