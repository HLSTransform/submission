Once there was a boy who was very charming. One day he promised his mum he would not mess up his bed sheets. But sadly he did not keep his promise. 
He woke up in the morning and he had messed up his bed sheets very badly. His mum was so angry and she shouted at him. He felt so upset.
Then Mum made him help clean up all of the sheets. He was very sad. After they were all clean, Mum promised him that he would not mess up his sheets again.
But unfortunately the boy could not keep the promise. He messed up the sheets again next week. 
His mum was so disappointed and angry. She said that until he could promise not to mess up the sheets again, he could not sleep in his own bed. 
The boy was so sad and he had learnt his lesson. He promised he would never do it again.
