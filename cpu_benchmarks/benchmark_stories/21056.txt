Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a shiny thing on the ground. It is brown and heavy.
"What is this?" Tom asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a coin," Sue says.
They pick up the shiny thing and look at it. It has some letters and numbers on it, but they cannot read them.
"Let's take it to Mom. She can tell us what it is," Tom says.
They run to the bench where Mom is sitting. They show her the shiny thing.
"Mom, look what we found!" Sue says.
Mom takes the shiny thing and looks at it. She frowns.
"Where did you find this?" she asks.
"In the park, near the slide," Tom says.
Mom shakes her head.
"This is not a coin. This is a piece of copper. It is a metal that people use to make things like wires and pipes. But it is not good for you to touch it. It can make you sick," she says.
She puts the copper in a plastic bag and throws it in the trash.
"Sorry, kids. You can't keep this. It is dangerous. You have to wash your hands now," she says.
Tom and Sue feel sad and uncomfortable. They liked the shiny thing. They did not know it was bad.
They go to the fountain and wash their hands. Mom gives them a hug and a cookie.
"It's okay. You did not mean to do anything wrong. You were just curious. But you have to be careful with things you find in the park. Some of them can hurt you. Next time, ask me before you pick up anything," she says.
Tom and Sue nod. They understand. They say sorry to Mom. They eat their cookies and play with their ball. They forget about the copper. They are happy again.
