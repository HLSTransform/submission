Alex loved to build. Every day he got out his special box of blocks and made towers, houses, and castles. One day, Alex wanted to build something special.
He remembered he had a tub of creamy ice cream in his freezer. He decided to build with it! He put a scoop on each block and stacked them all up. When he was finished, he had a big, tall ice cream castle.
Alex was so proud of his work. He couldn't wait to show his friends. But when they came over, they were envious. Some of them wanted to make their own ice cream castles. 
Alex laughed and said, "Let's all build one together!" So they all got to work, gathering blocks, cream and yummy toppings. They all worked together to make a castle of creamy ice cream that was twice as tall as Alex's. They were so proud of their work! 
From then on, Alex and his friends got together every day to build. And when it was hot outside, they always chose to build something special with ice cream. Delicious!
