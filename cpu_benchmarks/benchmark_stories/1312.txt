Once there was a man who liked to spend time with his family. Every weekend the man and his family would buy an order of their favourite soft food from the local store. The man would make sure that it was nice and soft so that his little three year old boy could enjoy it too.
The man and the boy would then spend their time together eating their delicious meal. As they ate, the man would make silly faces to make the little boy giggle. Then the boy would always remember the special time spent with his father. 
Afterwards, the man would carry the boy home and tuck him in bed - the little boy was exhausted from all the fun. Every weekend the man and his son would spend the same special time together, making the most of their family time.
