One day, a little frog named Tim was hopping in the woods. He saw a stream and wanted to test how deep it was. Tim was a bit upset because he could not swim very well. He met a fish named Sam who lived in the stream.
"Hi, Sam!" said Tim. "Can you help me test how deep the stream is?"
Sam smiled and said, "Of course, Tim! I can swim very well!" Sam swam down and found that the stream was not too deep. He came back up and told Tim, "Don't be upset, the stream is not deep at all!"
Tim felt happy and thanked Sam. They both played in the stream all day, and Tim learned to swim better with Sam's help. From that day on, they became best friends and had many more fun days at the stream.
