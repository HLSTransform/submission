Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play in the garden. One day, she saw a beautiful angel with strong wings sitting on a flower. Lily wanted to play with the angel, but the angel warned her not to touch its wings.
Lily didn't listen to the angel and tried to touch its wings. Suddenly, the angel's wings became weak and it fell to the ground. The angel was hurt and couldn't fly anymore. Lily felt very sad and wanted to help the angel.
She went to her mother and told her what happened. Her mother gave her a special ointment that could heal the angel's wings. Lily went back to the garden and put the ointment on the angel's wings. After a while, the angel's wings became strong again and it could fly away.
The angel thanked Lily for her kindness and flew away, leaving a beautiful flower in its place. From that day on, Lily always listened to warnings and never touched anything she wasn't supposed to. She knew that sometimes, even the strongest things can become weak if not taken care of properly.
