Jill likes to play with her dolls. She has many dolls with long hair, short hair, curly hair and straight hair. She likes to comb their hair and make them pretty. She has a big box where she keeps her dolls and their clothes.
One day, Jill's mom says it is time to cut Jill's hair. Jill's hair is very long and messy. It gets in her eyes and mouth. It is hard to wash and dry. Mom says Jill will look nice and neat with shorter hair. But Jill does not want to cut her hair. She says no to mom. She says she likes her hair long like her dolls. She says it is not fair to cut her hair.
Mom tries to explain to Jill that cutting her hair will not hurt. She says Jill can still play with her dolls and their hair. She says Jill can choose how to style her hair after the cut. She says Jill can have a lollipop if she is brave and lets mom cut her hair. But Jill still refuses. She cries and screams and runs away. She hides under her bed with her dolls.
Mom is sad and angry. She says Jill is being silly and stubborn. She says Jill is making a big fuss over nothing. She says Jill has to cut her hair or she will get in trouble. She says Jill has to come out of her bed or she will take away her dolls.
Jill does not listen to mom. She hugs her dolls and says they are her only friends. She says mom is mean and does not love her. She says she will never cut her hair. She says she will stay under her bed forever.
Mom does not know what to do. She is tired and frustrated. She thinks Jill is being rude and ungrateful. She thinks Jill is wasting her time and energy. She decides to leave Jill alone and hope she will change her mind. She goes to the kitchen and makes dinner.
Jill stays under her bed with her dolls. She does not hear mom calling her for dinner. She does not hear mom knocking on her door. She does not hear mom saying she is sorry and she loves her. She does not hear mom saying she will let Jill keep her hair long if she comes out and talks to her. She does not hear anything but her own voice and her dolls.
Jill falls asleep under her bed with her dolls. She has a bad dream. She dreams that a big scissors comes and cuts her hair and her dolls' hair. She dreams that her hair and her dolls' hair fall to the floor and turn into snakes. She dreams that the snakes bite her and her dolls and make them sick. She dreams that mom does not care and does not help. She dreams that she is alone and scared and hurt.
Jill wakes up under her bed with her dolls. She is cold and hungry and thirsty. She is sad and sorry and scared. She wants to see mom and hug her and say she is sorry. She wants to cut her hair and eat dinner and have a lollipop. She wants to be happy and loved and fair.
But it is too late. Mom is gone. Mom has left Jill and her dolls under the bed. Mom has taken her clothes and her keys and her phone. Mom has left a note on the table. The note says:
"Dear Jill,
I tried to be a good mom to you. I tried to make you happy and healthy and smart. I tried to teach you how to be polite and respectful and kind. I tried to give you everything you wanted and needed. But you did not appreciate me. You did not listen to me. You did not love me. You only loved your dolls and your hair. You refused to cut your hair. You refused to come out of your bed. You refused to talk to me. You refused to be my daughter.
I am tired of trying. I am tired of crying. I am tired of being alone. I am leaving you and your dolls and your hair. I am going to find a new place to live. A place where I can be happy and free. A place where I can find someone who loves me and listens to me and respects me. A place where I can be fair.
Goodbye, Jill.
Mom."
