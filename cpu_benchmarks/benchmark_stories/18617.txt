Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a hut with her mommy and daddy. They were very poor and had to raise their own food.
One day, Lily was playing outside when she saw a butterfly. She chased it and ran into the street without looking. A car was coming, but she was too careless to notice. The car hit her and she got hurt very badly.
Her mommy and daddy rushed her to the hospital, but the doctors couldn't save her. They were very sad and cried a lot. Lily's mommy said, "We should have been more careful with her." Her daddy said, "We should have raised her to be more aware of danger." They hugged each other and cried some more.
