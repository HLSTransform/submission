Once upon a time there was a little boy called Jack. One day, Jack decided to go for a walk. On his walk, Jack came to a big tree. He looked over and saw a funny knot in the tree. Jack was very surprised!
He asked the knot, 'What are you doing in the tree?'
The knot replied, 'I'm tying a bow!'
Jack said, 'That's a lot of work. But I don't understand how you can do it!'
The knot laughed and said, 'I'm a magical knot! And I can tie a bow in a noisy way!'
Jack couldn't believe it. He watched as the knot created a beautiful bow. It was the best bow Jack had ever seen!
Jack thanked the knot for the surprise. From then on, Jack always stopped to visit the knot in the big tree.
