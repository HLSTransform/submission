Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her shiny red car. One day, Lily decided to polish her car to make it even shinier. She grabbed a cloth and started rubbing it all over the car. 
After she finished, Lily's mom gave her a quiz to see if she remembered all the colors of the rainbow. Lily answered all the questions correctly and felt very proud of herself. 
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. She saw the shiny red car and said, "I wish I had an original toy like that." Lily felt happy to have such a special toy. 
But then, while they were playing, Lily's friend accidentally broke the car. Lily was so sad that her special toy was ruined. She cried and cried, but her friend didn't understand why she was so upset. The end.
