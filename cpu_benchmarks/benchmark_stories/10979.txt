Once upon a time, in a small forest, there was a gentle deer named Dara. Dara loved to stand by the big tree with her friends. One day, while they were playing, Dara found a shiny crystal on the ground. It was so pretty that she wanted to keep it for herself.
Dara showed the crystal to her friends. They all wanted to touch it, but Dara said, "No, this is mine!" Her friends were sad and walked away. Dara stood alone with her crystal, feeling happy but also a little lonely.
As the sun began to set, Dara thought about her friends. She realized that it was not nice to keep the crystal all to herself. She called her friends back and let them touch the crystal too. They all stood together, happy and smiling. From that day on, Dara shared her things with her friends and learned that sharing with others made her feel even happier.
