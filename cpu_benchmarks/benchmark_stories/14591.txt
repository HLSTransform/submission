Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old and wore a pink mitten on one hand. One day she was playing in the snow and had so much fun!
Suddenly, she felt something strange. She had hurt her hand and it was starting to hurt! She started to cry and her mama came running to help. Mama put a bandage on her hand and said it would be better soon.
Then Mama said it was time for a nap, so she tucked the girl into bed and gave her a cuddle. The little girl felt so sleepy. She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep. While she was sleeping, her mitten stayed on her hand, keeping it warm and safe.
The little girl woke up the next day and her hand was all better. She was happy and she wanted to keep playing in the snow. With her pink mitten on, she ran outside to play and have fun all day!
