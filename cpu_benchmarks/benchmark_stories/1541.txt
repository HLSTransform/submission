Once upon a time, there was a kind and generous grandma. She loved to bake cookies and share them with her friends. One day, she made a big batch of cookies and put them in a jar. She said to her granddaughter, "Would you like to help me mail these cookies to our friends?"
The granddaughter was excited to help her grandma. They went to the post office and put the jar of cookies in a big envelope. The postman said, "What a generous gift! Your friends will be very happy to receive these cookies in the mail."
As they walked back home, the granddaughter asked, "Grandma, can I have a pill for my headache?" The grandma replied, "Of course, dear. Let me get you some water to take the pill with." The granddaughter felt better and said, "Thank you, grandma. You're the best!"
