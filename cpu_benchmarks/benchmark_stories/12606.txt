Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the park to play. Timmy brought his toy cars with him.
While Timmy was playing, he crashed his toy car into a big rock. "Oh no, my car is wrecked!" Timmy cried. His mom hugged him and said, "Don't worry, we can fix it."
Later that day, Timmy's mom put the toy car in the freezer to make it cold. When she took it out, the car had melted! "What happened?" Timmy asked. "The cold made the car melt," his mom explained. "It's an unknown thing that can happen to some toys." Timmy was sad that his car was gone, but he was happy to have learned something new.
