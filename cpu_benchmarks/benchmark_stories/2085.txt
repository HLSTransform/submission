Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, but he also loved to go on adventures. One day, Timmy went to the store with his mom. He saw a toy he really wanted, but he didn't know the price.
"Mommy, how much does this toy use?" Timmy asked.
"It costs ten dollars," his mom replied.
Timmy didn't have ten dollars, but he really wanted the toy. "Can we go on an adventurous treasure hunt to find the money?" he asked his mom.
His mom smiled. "Sure, let's go on an adventure to find the money for the toy."
So, Timmy and his mom went on a treasure hunt. They searched high and low until they found a shiny coin on the ground. It was worth ten dollars! Timmy was so happy that he could finally buy the toy he wanted.
"Thank you, Mommy, for going on an adventurous treasure hunt with me," Timmy said.
"You're welcome, Timmy. I'm glad we found the money for your toy," his mom replied with a smile.
