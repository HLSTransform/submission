Once upon a time there was a little bird. The bird was very clumsy. It kept bumping into things and often land on the ground. The bird wanted to fly but it did not know how.
One day, the bird saw a man in the sky. The man said, "Let me help you fly." But the bird was still scared. It did not know if it should trust the man.
The man said, "Don't worry. I will show you how to fly. You just need to spread your wings and learn from the pain. When you do, you will know how to fly."
The bird was still scared. It asked, "Will it hurt?"
The man said, "Yes, it will hurt a little, but then you will know how to fly."
The bird believed the man and spread its wings. When it felt the pain, the bird knew that it was flying. And from that day on, the bird was always flying high in the sky.
