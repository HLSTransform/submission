Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys all day long. One day, Timmy found a hard pipe in his backyard. He picked it up and started to play with it. Suddenly, the pipe got very hot and started to burn Timmy's hand. Timmy cried out in pain and dropped the pipe. His mom came running outside to see what happened. She saw that Timmy's hand was burned and took him to the doctor. From that day on, Timmy knew to be careful with hot things like the burning pipe.
