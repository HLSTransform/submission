Joe and Jane were great friends. They always had fun together.
Every morning they would run around and laugh.
One day, Joe got into trouble. He got lost. Jane searched the whole day but couldn't find him.
But then, Jane had an idea. She said "I love Joe, I know he will find his way". Then she sang a song.
Soon, Joe heard the song and followed it. He found his way back to Jane. When they saw each other, they hugged and laughed. They were so happy to be together again.
Joe and Jane knew that true friends love each other, no matter what the trouble. They were forever grateful for the great friendship they shared.
