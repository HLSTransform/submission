Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a sign that said "Beware of the dog." Lily didn't like the sign because it made her feel scared.
As she continued to play, she heard a loud bark. She turned around and saw a big, scary dog running towards her. Lily was very frightened and started to cry. But then, her mom came running over to comfort her. She hugged Lily tightly and told her everything was going to be okay.
After a few minutes, the dog's owner came over and apologized. He explained that his dog was actually very friendly and just wanted to play. Lily's mom agreed to let her play with the dog, and they all had a great time together. Even though the dog looked disgusting with his slobber and muddy paws, Lily wasn't scared anymore because she knew he was a good boy.
