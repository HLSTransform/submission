Once upon a time, there was a furry fly. He wanted to meet new friends, so he decided to go on an adventure. He flew around the world and introduced himself to all the animals he saw. First, he met a lion, and then a rabbit, and then an elephant. He even said hi to a bird!
The fly kept meeting lots of furry friends. He told everyone that he was a fly, and everyone was so excited to meet him. They laughed as he buzzed around and played games with them. Eventually, he introduced himself to a family of foxes. They were so friendly, and they asked him to stay and play with them for a while. The furry fly was so happy to have made so many new friends. 
The fox family and the fly spent the whole day playing and having fun. When it was time to go, the furry fly thanked the fox family for their hospitality. He said goodbye and flew away, feeling so happy to have made so many new furry friends. The end.
