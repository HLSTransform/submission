Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cart that she loved to play with. One day, Lily saw a butterfly flying in the sky. She wanted to catch it, so she put the butterfly in her cart.
The butterfly was very scared and felt trapped in the cart. Lily saw that the butterfly was fearful and wanted to help it. She said, "Don't be scared, little butterfly. I will set you free."
Lily opened the cart and let the butterfly fly away. The butterfly was happy to be free and flew away into the sky. Lily felt happy too because she helped the butterfly. From that day on, Lily loved to watch the butterflies fly in the sky.
