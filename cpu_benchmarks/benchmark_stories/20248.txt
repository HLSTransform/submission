One day, a chubby cat named Tom found a big thing called a microscope. Tom was very curious about it. He wanted to see what it could do. So, Tom decided to lift the microscope and take it to his friend, a little mouse named Tim.
Tom and Tim looked at the microscope together. They did not know how to use it, but they tried their best. They put a tiny leaf under the microscope and looked inside. They saw many small things they had never seen before. Tom and Tim were very excited.
Every day, Tom and Tim would lift the microscope and look at new things. They saw tiny bugs, small pieces of food, and even a little piece of Tim's tail. The chubby cat and the little mouse had lots of fun with their microscope. They learned many new things and became the best of friends.
