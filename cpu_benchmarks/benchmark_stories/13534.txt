Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very shy and he didn't have any friends. One day, he went to the store with his mom and saw a game that he really wanted. He asked his mom to buy it for him, but his mom said he had to use his own money.
Timmy didn't have any money, so he decided to sell his toy cars to make some. He went to his neighbors' houses and knocked on their doors. He asked if they wanted to buy his toy cars. Some people said no, but some people said yes and gave him some money.
After a while, Timmy had enough money to buy the game he wanted. He went back to the store with his mom and bought the game. When he got home, he played the game all by himself and had a lot of fun. From that day on, Timmy wasn't so shy anymore and he made some new friends who liked to play games with him.
