Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a kind, compassionate owner named Amy. Amy had a cute, little dog named Max. Max loved to play outside and lay in the warm, soft grass.
One day, Max was laying in the grass when a small bird flew down and landed near him. The bird was hurt and couldn't fly. Max barked to call Amy. Amy came outside and saw the hurt bird. She said, "Oh no, little bird! We need to help you."
Amy carefully picked up the bird and took it inside the house. She gave it some water and a cozy place to rest. Max stayed by the bird's side, watching over it like a good friend. After some days, the bird started to feel better.
The bird said, "Thank you, Amy and Max, for helping me get better." Max barked happily, and Amy smiled. The bird flew away, but it always came back to visit its new friends.
The moral of the story is to always be compassionate and help others when they need it.
