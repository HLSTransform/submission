Tom liked to mark on the wall with his crayons. He made big lines and circles and stars. He thought his marks were pretty and fun. But Mom did not like Tom's marks. She said they were messy and bad. She made Tom wash the wall with a wet cloth.
One day, Tom found a new thing to mark with. It was a stick that had ash on the end. Tom saw Dad use it to make fire in the fireplace. Tom thought the ash was black and cool. He wanted to mark with it. He took the stick and went to the wall.
Tom made ash marks on the wall. He made big lines and circles and stars. He thought his ash marks were pretty and fun. But Mom did not like Tom's ash marks. She said they were dirty and worse. She made Tom wash the wall with a wet cloth and soap.
Mom was angry and sad. She said Tom was naughty and careless. She said he could not mark on the wall anymore. She took away his crayons and his stick. Tom was sorry and sad. He said he was sorry and he loved Mom.
Mom was thoughtful and kind. She said she loved Tom too. She said he could mark on paper or on a board. She gave him some paper and some chalk. Tom was happy and glad. He said thank you and he hugged Mom. He marked on the paper with the chalk. He made big lines and circles and stars. He thought his chalk marks were pretty and fun. And Mom thought so too.
