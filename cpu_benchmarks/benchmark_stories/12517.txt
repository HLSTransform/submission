Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mom went to the park to have a picnic. They brought sandwiches, fruit, and juice. Lily was so excited to eat her sandwich, but she noticed it had a bite taken out of it. 
"Mommy, someone took a bite out of my sandwich!" Lily exclaimed.
"It's okay, Lily. Maybe a little animal was hungry and needed a snack," her mom replied.
As they were eating, Lily noticed that the juice was starting to leak out of the bottle. "Mommy, the juice is leaking!" she said.
"It's okay, Lily. We can clean it up later," her mom said with a smile.
After they finished eating, Lily started feeling pale and tired. "Mommy, I don't feel good," she said.
"It's okay, Lily. Let's go home and rest," her mom said as she picked up their things and they walked back to their car.
