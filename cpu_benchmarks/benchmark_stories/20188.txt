Ben and Lily wanted to have a picnic in the park. They packed some bread, cheese, apples and juice in a basket. They also took a big blanket to sit on. They were very happy and excited.
They walked to the park with their mom and dad. They found a nice spot under a big tree. They spread the blanket on the grass and opened the basket. They were ready to eat and have fun.
But then they smelled something smelly. It was coming from the trash can near the tree. There were many flies and ants around it. It was very yucky.
"Yuck! What is that smell?" Ben asked.
"It's the trash can. Someone left some bad food in it. It's rotten and stinky," Lily said.
They did not want to eat near the trash can. They did not want to get sick or dirty. They wanted to move to another spot.
They sighed. They were not happy and excited anymore. They were sad and disappointed.
"Mom, Dad, can we go somewhere else?" Ben and Lily asked.
"Of course, sweeties. Let's pack up and find a better place. There are many other spots in the park. We can still have a nice picnic," Mom and Dad said.
They smiled. They were hopeful and cheerful again. They picked up the blanket and the basket. They walked away from the trash can. They looked for a clean and sunny spot. They still wanted to have a picnic in the park.
