Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sing and dance, and she dreamed of being in a band. One day, she found a sweet guitar in her attic. She was so happy and excited to play it.
Lily showed her guitar to her friends at school, and they all thought it was cool. They decided to start a band together. They practiced every day and got better and better. They were so excited to reveal their band to their families and friends.
But one day, Lily's guitar was stolen. She was heartbroken. She searched everywhere, but she couldn't find it. Without her guitar, the band couldn't play their music anymore. Lily was so sad that she didn't want to sing or dance anymore. The bad ending was that the band never played again.
