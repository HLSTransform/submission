One day, a little boy named Tim went to his grandma's house. He saw many photos on the wall. He liked the photos because they were big and impressive. The photos showed his grandma, grandpa, and other family members. Tim felt happy when he saw them.
Tim wanted to touch the photos. He tried to reach them, but they were too high. He got a chair and stood on it. Now, he could touch the photos. He touched the photo of his grandma and grandpa. He felt like he was with them.
His grandma saw him and smiled. She said, "Tim, you like the photos, don't you?" Tim nodded and said, "Yes, grandma, they are very nice!" Grandma was happy that Tim liked the photos. They spent the day looking at more photos and having fun together.
