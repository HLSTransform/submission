Once upon a time, there was a little girl who really wanted to sail. She had a great big boat with lots of toys and snacks. 
She had a delicious picnic every day before she left to sail around the ocean. Every day she would sail farther and farther away.
One day while she was sailing, she sailed all the way to an island. She explored the island and found an exam! She was so excited and wanted to take it. She took the exam and did her very best. When she finished, the exam congratulated her and told her that she passed! 
She was so happy and thanked the exam. Then she sailed back home. Along the way, she stopped to eat a delicious dinner of her favorite foods. 
When she finally arrived home, her friends and family congratulated her on passing the exam and proudly said, "You did it!"
