Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and look at bugs with her brown microscope. One day, she found a caterpillar and showed it to her mom.
"Mommy, look at the little caterpillar! Can we raise it and watch it turn into a butterfly?" Lily asked.
"Yes, we can," her mom said with a smile.
So, they put the caterpillar in a jar and watched it every day. But one morning, Lily woke up to find that the caterpillar had died. She was very sad and cried.
"I'm sorry, Lily. Sometimes things don't go the way we want them to," her mom said, trying to comfort her.
Lily was still sad, but she knew that her caterpillar was now in a better place. She would always remember the little brown bug that she tried to raise into a butterfly.
