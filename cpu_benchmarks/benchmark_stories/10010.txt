Once upon a time, there was an elderly lady who loved to bake. She would always use a teaspoon to measure her ingredients. One day, while she was baking cookies, she realized she had run out of sugar. She paused for a moment and thought about what to do.
She decided to go to the store to buy more sugar. As she was walking, she saw a little boy crying. She asked him what was wrong and he said he had lost his toy. The elderly lady paused again and thought about how she could help him.
She remembered she had a toy at home that she could give to the little boy. So, she brought him to her house and gave him the toy. The little boy stopped crying and was very happy. The elderly lady then went to the store and bought her sugar. She returned home and finished baking her cookies, feeling happy that she was able to help someone in need.
