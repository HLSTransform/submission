Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her yard. One day, she was playing with her ball, and it went over the fence. She said, "Oh no, my ball is gone!"
Her mommy asked her, "What's wrong, Lily?"
"My ball is gone. It went over the fence," Lily said.
"Don't worry, we'll get it back," her mommy said.
They went to the fence and Lily's mommy lifted her up so she could see over it. She saw her ball and said, "Yay! Thank you, mommy. I missed my ball."
When they got back inside, Lily's mommy gave her a delicious snack. Lily said, "Yum! This is delicious. Thank you, mommy."
