Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Sally. One day, Sally decided to go for a walk. She went outside and followed the path in front of her. As she walked, the path lead to a small dry cabin.
When she arrived at the cabin, Sally was curious to find out what was inside. She opened the door and found a surprise.
There was a squirrel inside the cabin. Sally said, "Hello squirrel! What are you doing in this dry cabin?".
The squirrel smiled and said, "I was looking for a place to hide, and this dry cabin was the perfect spot!". 
Sally and the squirrel then became friends. They played together in the cabin all day.
At the end of the day, Sally said goodbye to the squirrel and went home. From that day forward, Sally visited the dry cabin every day to follow and play with the squirrel.
