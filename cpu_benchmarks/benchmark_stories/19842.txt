Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Mittens. Mittens loved to sleep all day and do nothing. One day, Mittens saw a sack in the yard. Mittens got curious and went to check it out. 
Inside the sack, Mittens found a shiny pistol. Mittens didn't know what it was, but it looked cool. Mittens played with the pistol and accidentally shot a hole in the fence. 
Mittens' owner saw the hole and got very angry. She knew Mittens had done it and took the pistol away. Mittens learned that playing with things he didn't understand could lead to trouble. From then on, Mittens went back to being a lazy cat, but he always stayed away from strange things in the yard.
