Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but some of them were old and broken. Her mom said they were "junk" and needed to be thrown away. 
Lily was sad because she didn't want to lose her toys. But her mom had an idea! They could "replace" the broken toys with new ones. 
So they went to the toy store and picked out some new toys. Lily was so happy! She played with them all day and didn't even think about the "spoiled" toys that were now in the garbage. 
From that day on, Lily learned that sometimes it's okay to let go of old things and "replace" them with new ones.
