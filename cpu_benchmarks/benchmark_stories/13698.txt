Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a kitty named Mittens. Lily loved Mittens very much, but one day Mittens ran away. Lily looked for Mittens everywhere, but she couldn't find her. 
One day, Lily saw a smelly dog in her yard. She hated that dog because he scared her. The dog had a match in his mouth and he started to play with it. The match fell on the ground and a fire started. 
Lily was very scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly, Mittens appeared and meowed loudly. Mittens jumped on the dog and made him go away. 
Lily was so happy to have Mittens back and she hugged her tightly. She knew now that she loved Mittens more than anything else in the world.
