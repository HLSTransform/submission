Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the beach with her family. She saw a bright shell and picked it up. 
Her little brother, Max, saw a big rock and wanted to climb it. He asked Lily to come with him, but she didn't want to leave her shell. Max requested that she come with him again, but Lily still wanted to keep her shell. 
As they were playing, they found an oyster. Lily didn't know what it was, so she asked her mommy. Her mommy explained that it was a special kind of shell that had a surprise inside. They opened it up and found a pearl! Lily was so happy that she gave her shell to Max. They both went home with a special treasure.
