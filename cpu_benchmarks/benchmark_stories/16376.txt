Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, empty box. Lily wanted to fill the box with fun things. She put her toys, her ball, and her books in the box. Now, the box was not empty anymore!
One day, Lily saw a cat. The cat was very cute. Lily wanted the cat to be her friend. She tried to recognize the cat, but she did not know the cat. The cat gave her a wink. Lily smiled and knew they could be friends.
Lily and the cat played with the toys in the box. They had so much fun! The cat liked the ball the most. They played all day. When it was time for bed, Lily and the cat were very tired. They slept next to the box, happy and full of love.
