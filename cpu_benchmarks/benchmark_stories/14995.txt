Mia and Mommy went to the park. Mommy put on her shoes and said, "Let's go for a jog!" Mia smiled, so they started jogging.
Mia saw a big tree and said, "Look, Mommy!" She pointed to the tree and Mommy said, "That's a nice big tree." Mia nodded and kept jogging.
Suddenly, a heavy rain started. Mia and Mommy had to stop jogging. Mommy said, "Oh no! Now we need to go back home." Mia frowned and said, "But I want to keep jogging." Mommy replied, "I'm sorry Mia, but it's too heavy outside now."
Mia was sad about having to go home, but she was happy that she got to see the big tree. She smiled as she and Mommy went back home.
