Once there was a boy who was very foolish. He liked to do things that weren't wise. One day he saw a subway. He thought it would be fun to try and lift it up. He tried and tried, but the subway was too heavy and he couldn't lift it.
He was very sad, but he didn't give up. He asked the people nearby for help. Many people stopped to help him. Together they all used their strength to lift the subway.
After the subway was lifted, everyone was very proud. The boy was happy that he was able to use his friends' help to do something wonderful. He learned that it was better to work together than alone. Doing things alone can sometimes be foolish.
