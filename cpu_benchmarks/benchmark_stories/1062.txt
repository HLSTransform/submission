Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Janet. She was very excited to paint her room. She needed permission from her mum before she could start, so she went to her mum to ask. "Mum, will you please permit me to paint my room?" Janet asked. Her mother smiled and said, "Yes, of course, you can do it."
Janet felt very grateful, so she smiled and thanked her mum. She rushed off to grab her paintbrush and paint. Janet was so excited to start painting her walls that she couldn't wait! 
When she finished, she looked around and was very pleased with her work. She smiled, happy that she had permission to paint. She was grateful for her mother for letting her. 
The end.
