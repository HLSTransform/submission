Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and run. But it was very cold today. The wind was blowing and the sky was gray. Tom and Lily started to shiver.
"Let's go home," Tom said. "I want some soup."
"Me too," Lily said. "Soup is warm and yummy."
They ran to their house. Mom was waiting for them. She had a big pot of soup on the stove. She gave them each a bowl and a spoon. She also gave them some bread and butter.
"Here you go, my sweeties," Mom said. "This will make you feel better."
Tom and Lily smiled. They ate their soup. It was brown and had carrots and potatoes and chicken. They liked it a lot. They dipped their bread in the soup and ate it too. They used their forks to pick up the carrots and potatoes and chicken. They were not shivering anymore. They were warm and happy.
"Thank you, Mom," Tom and Lily said. "You make the best soup."
Mom hugged them. She was glad they liked her soup. She loved them very much.
