Once upon a time there was a dreamy crab. He loved to lie in the warm sun and dream of wonderful things.
One day, he decided to explore. He found a wide beach, with warm sand and blue sea. It was just perfect. He started to walk and looked around.
Suddenly, he saw a crab friend. The crabs hugged and decided to have some fun. They ran around the beach, looking for shells and stones. Then, they lay down in the warm sand and dreamed and dreamed.
When it got dark, the crabs said their goodbyes and went their separate ways. The dreamy crab was sure he would see his friends again soon.
