Once upon a time, there was a big hairy monster. The monster loved yarn and he asked everyone he met if he could borrow some.
One day, the monster asked a little girl for some yarn. He thought she would be happy to help him. But the little girl refused. She said the yarn was for her mother and she didn't want to part with it. 
The monster was very unhappy. He asked the little girl again, but she refused to give him any yarn. He stomped around her and growled. He was very angry and it made the little girl feel uncomfortable. 
Now, the monster had to find another way to get some yarn. He tried asking many other people, but they all refused too. 
Eventually, the monster had to find another way to get the yarn he wanted. He had to be creative! He found some other materials to make the yarn he wanted. He used some grass and some string, and he was able to make the yarn he needed. 
The monster was finally happy and the little girl was relieved. She was happy the monster had been able to get the yarn he wanted without her help.
