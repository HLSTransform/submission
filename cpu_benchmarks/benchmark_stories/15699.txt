Once upon a time, there was a mom with a daughter. The daughter was very stubborn and didn't like to listen to her mom. Every day, the mom would tell her daughter to do something and the daughter wouldn't do it. 
One day, the mom said to her daughter, "Please clean your bedroom." But the daughter said no. The mom said, "It is time to do it now!" But the daughter said no again. The mom got very mad, so she asked her daughter, "Why won't you listen to me?" 
The daughter said, "I don't wanna do it!" The mom was so frustrated that she said, "You must do it. I say it for a reason." But the daughter still said no. 
The mom knew her daughter was very stubborn, so she said, "I love you very much, please listen to me this time." The daughter thought for a while and then agreed to do it. The mom was so happy and she hugged her daughter. 
In the end, the daughter cleaned the bedroom like her mom told her to.
