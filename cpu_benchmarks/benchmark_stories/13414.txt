Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her garden. One day, it rained and the garden got wet. Lily put on her raincoat and boots and went outside to play. She saw a pretty flower that was glowing in the rain. It was so beautiful! She picked the flower and showed it to her mommy. Her mommy smiled and said, "That's a special flower, Lily. It only glows when it's wet." Lily was so happy to have found such a special flower in her garden. From that day on, she always looked for glowing flowers when it rained.
