Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to be independent. She wanted to do things by herself, even tough it was sometimes hard. 
One day, she found a mushroom in the forest. She was so surprised to see that it was so big! She was very proud of discovering it and decided to show it to her mom. 
So she started walking towards home. 
Then, her mom saw the mushroom and said, “What a nice mushroom! Do you want to put it in the garden?” 
The little girl ran to the garden, looked around, and acted quickly. She took the mushroom and planted it right beside her mom's favourite flower. 
From then on, the little girl enjoyed looking after her mushroom everyday. She knew that it was her responsibility and she felt proud to be so independent.
