Tim and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys. Mia has a new toy. It is a cool car. It can go fast and make noises.
"Look at my car, Tim!" Mia says. "Do you want to try it?"
Tim is shy. He does not have a car like that. He thinks he will break it. He shakes his head.
"No, thank you, Mia. I like your car, but I do not want to play with it."
Mia is sad. She wants to share her car with Tim. She thinks he will like it. She encourages him.
"Please, Tim, do not be afraid. My car is strong. It will not break. You can play with it. I will show you how. It is fun!"
Tim looks at Mia. He sees that she is happy. He wants to be happy too. He nods his head.
"Okay, Mia. I will try your car. Thank you for sharing it with me."
Mia smiles. She gives Tim her car. She shows him how to make it go and stop and turn. Tim listens and learns. He pushes the car on the floor. He makes noises with his mouth. He has fun.
"Wow, Mia, your car is cool!" Tim says. "I like it a lot. Can we play with it together?"
Mia nods. She is glad. She takes another toy. It is a truck. She and Tim play with the car and the truck. They race and chase and crash. They laugh and talk. They are happy. They are friends.
