Once upon a time there was a little girl named Molly. She was a very tidy girl and always kept her room in perfect order. One day, Molly was so excited to play with her toys. She was feeling really happy. 
Then, Molly had the idea to have spaghetti for dinner! It was something she had been wanting to try. She asked her mom if they could have spaghetti and her mom said yes. So Molly helped her mom make dinner and they cooked the spaghetti together. 
After dinner they all sat down to eat. Molly tried the spaghetti and it was so yummy! She was so happy that she kicked her feet in joy. She kept kicking her feet under the table and it made her giggle with delight. 
Molly and her family enjoyed their dinner and had a very special night. They all enjoyed the tasty spaghetti and the happy moment. Molly went to bed feeling so satisfied and thankful for the tidy dinner.
The End.
