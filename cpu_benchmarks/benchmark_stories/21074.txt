Anna liked to chew gum. She chewed gum all day and all night. She did not listen to her mom, who told her to stop chewing gum. She said gum was good and fun.
One day, Anna went to the opera with her mom and dad. They wore nice clothes and sat in a big room. Anna did not like the opera. She thought it was loud and boring. She wanted to chew gum, but her mom said no. She said gum was rude and dirty.
Anna was angry. She waited for her mom to look away. Then she took a gum from her pocket and put it in her mouth. She chewed it hard and fast. She blew a big bubble. She smiled.
But then, the bubble popped. The gum stuck to her face and hair. It also stuck to the seat and the floor. Anna tried to pull it off, but it was too sticky. She cried and screamed.
Her mom and dad were very mad. They took her out of the room. The people in the opera were very mad too. They booed and hissed. Anna felt bad and ashamed.
But it was too late. The gum did not come off. It stayed on her face and hair forever. Anna could not chew gum anymore. She could not eat or talk or smile. She was dead inside. She wished she had listened to her mom.
