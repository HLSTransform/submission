Sara and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to dig in the sand and look for bugs and rocks. They found a big hole that someone had made. Sara wanted to go inside and see what was there.
"Can we go in the hole, Ben?" Sara asked.
Ben looked at the hole. It was dark and deep. He felt scared.
"No, Sara, we can't. It's too dangerous. We might get lost or hurt. Mama said we have to stay in the park and not go underground."
Sara pouted. She was curious and brave. She did not like to listen to Mama.
"Please, Ben, just for a little bit. I promise we will come back soon. It will be fun. Maybe we will find treasure or a secret tunnel."
Ben shook his head. He did not want to go in the hole. But he did not want to make Sara sad or angry. He loved his sister.
"Okay, Sara, but only for a little bit. And you have to hold my hand and follow me. And we have to be quiet and careful. And we have to come back before Mama calls us. Do you promise?"
Sara nodded. She smiled and grabbed Ben's hand. They crawled into the hole.
They did not find treasure or a secret tunnel. They found a terrible snake. It was big and black and had red eyes. It hissed and coiled and bit Ben on his leg. Ben screamed and let go of Sara's hand. He tried to run back to the park, but he was too slow and the snake followed him. Sara was left alone in the dark. She cried and called for Ben and Mama, but no one heard her. She broke her promise and she lost her brother. She was very sorry and very scared.
