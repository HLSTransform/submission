Once upon a time there was a reliable path. This path was full of twists and turns but it was a fun and exciting journey nonetheless. Whenever the path zig zagged, it always made sure that the travelers who used it were safe.
One day, a little girl wanted to explore what lay beyond the reliable path. She carefully made her way down the path, admiring all of the sights around her. She eventually found a big, glittering waterfall. The rush of the water made her feel like she could soar forever.
The little girl wanted to see what else lay ahead, so she zipped down the path and around the bend. She found a tall tree with a bunch of glittering apples. She wanted to take one, but the angels warned her not to.
The girl then continued down the path. She saw so many wonderful things until she eventually made it back to the reliable path she started on. The little girl realized just how special the path was and vowed to always take it.
