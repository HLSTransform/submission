Once upon a time there was a big, brave bear. He lived in a deep, dark forest. One day, the bear heard a noise. He looked around and saw a mouse, shaking with fear. The bear could see the mouse trembling. He asked the mouse why it was so scared.
The mouse said that it was looking for something. The bear said he might be able to help. The mouse thanked the bear and pointed with its little mouse paw. The mouse said that it was looking for a yummy nut.
The bear thought for a moment and then said that he knew where to find one. He led the mouse to a special spot in the forest. The mouse couldn't believe it when it saw the nut. It was so grateful that it ran back and thanked the bear.
The mouse was so excited that it decided to come back and visit the bear again, to say thank you. The bear thought it was a great idea and smiled.
But the mouse didn't know that the bear had an even bigger surprise in store when it returned, one that was about to make it tremble for an altogether different reason.
