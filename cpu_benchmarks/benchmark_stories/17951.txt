Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a little rabbit named Remy. Remy loved to perform for his friends. He would dance, sing, and make them laugh. Everyone loved Remy because he was a good friend.
One day, Remy found a big, shiny stone. He thought it was very pretty, so he showed it to his friends. They all wanted the stone, but Remy didn't want to give it away. He thought the stone had a big value.
Remy's friends were sad because he didn't want to share. They stopped watching Remy perform and playing with him. Remy felt lonely and sad. He realized that the value of the stone was not as big as the value of his friends.
Remy decided to share the big, shiny stone with his friends. They were all happy again, and they watched Remy perform with big smiles on their faces. Remy learned that sharing and being a good friend is more important than having something valuable.
And from that day on, Remy and his friends played, laughed, and performed together. They knew the big value of friendship and sharing. And they all lived happily ever after in the big forest.
