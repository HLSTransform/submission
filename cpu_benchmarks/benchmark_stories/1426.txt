Once upon a time there was a man who sang every day. He sang while driving to the harbor in his car. He sang as he went up the tall hill to the harbor. Once he reached the top of the hill, he stopped his car and looked out at the harbor.
The day was bright and the water was blue. He could even see the boats in the harbor. He opened his car window and started singing his favorite song. The sound echoed over the harbor and it sounded very high.
The harbor birds joined in and flew around in the sky. They sang with the man and created a beautiful melody. The man smiled and sang louder and louder. He sang until the sun was setting behind the harbor.
