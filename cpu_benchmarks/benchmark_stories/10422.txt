Once there was a mom and her little girl. The mom said to the little girl, "Let's go outside and play!"
The little girl was so excited. She said "Yes!"
The little girl ran outside and saw a big stair. She looked at it and saw that it had a lot of steps - all different sizes. She said to her mom "What is this? It looks different" 
Her mom said, "It's a stair. You can climb up and down it, but be careful not to drop!"
The little girl was so excited. She climbed up and down the stair and she dropped a few times but it was all part of the fun. 
At the end of her game, she climbed up the stairs to her mom and said, "That was great! I want to do it again!" 
The mom smiled and said, "We can come out and play on the stair again tomorrow!"
