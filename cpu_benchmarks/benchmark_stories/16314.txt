Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a lot of toys, but he didn't take care of them very well. He would throw them around and leave them on the floor.
One day, Timmy's mom noticed that he had lost one of his favorite toys. She asked him where it was, but he didn't know. She helped him organize his toys and they found the missing toy.
Timmy's mom told him that it's important to value and take care of our things, especially the ones we love. She also showed him how to keep his toys soft and clean. From that day on, Timmy learned to take better care of his things and he never lost another toy again.
