Once upon a time there were two friends who were going for a picnic. They walked until they came to a tall hill. As they looked around, they saw a zip running down the side of the hill. So they followed the zip until they reached a big shade. The shade was big and unknown.
The friends were excited. They had found a secret place. They sat under the shade and ate their food. They even stayed there to take a nap. They felt safe and happy under the shade.
After their nap, they decided to explore the area. As they wandered, they found a zip in the ground. They dug the zip open with their hands and to their surprise, a shiny golden coin popped out! They had found a special unknown treasure.
The two friends hugged each other and then put the coin in their pocket. They followed the zip back to their picnic blanket and talked excitedly about their adventure. The treasure was their little secret and they kept it safe.
