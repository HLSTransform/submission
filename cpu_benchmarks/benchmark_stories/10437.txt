Mum and Dad had a surprise for Sam. It was a special trip to the city. Sam had never been before and was excited to learn something new.
At the city, Sam saw lots of different things including tall buildings and busy streets. Everyone was carrying a newspaper. Sam asked Mum what it was and she said it was filled with news. Sam was eager to learn about the world around him.
Sam and his family went to a cafe for lunch. It was a wonderful experience and Sam was spoilt with delicious treats. He couldn't believe all the exciting things he had learnt on his city trip. 
Before they headed home, they stopped off at the pet store. Sam saw lots of amazing animals that he had never seen before. He learnt so many things about them, from their patterns and colours, to what it takes to look after them. 
Sam couldn't wait to go back to the city and learn something new.
