Maddie and her mom were friends. Maddie was very loyal to her mom and always listened to what she said. One day, her mom said "No snacks before dinner! I have put everything in the fridge to prevent you from getting them early." Maddie was sad and did not understand why her mom was so strict. But, Maddie was still loyal and followed her mom's instructions. She waited patiently for dinner, knowing she could get a snack afterwards. At dinner, Maddie was very happy as she got to eat all the delicious food she wanted. She was thankful for her loyal mom who wanted to prevent her from eating unhealthy snacks.
