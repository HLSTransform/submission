Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Amy. She had a big heart and loved to help others. One day, she found a lost dog in her yard. The dog was sad and hungry, so Amy gave it some food and water.
Amy knew she had to find the dog's home. She asked her friends and neighbors if they knew the truth about the dog's family. No one knew where the dog came from, but they all wanted to help. They all looked around the town for clues.
Finally, they found the dog's family. The family was so happy to have their dog back. They thanked Amy and her friends for their kind help. Everyone was glad to see the dog go home, and they all lived happily ever after.
