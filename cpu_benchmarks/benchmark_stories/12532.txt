Once upon a time, there was a tall tree. The tree was very big and had lots of leaves. A raven lived in the tree. The raven was black and had shiny feathers. Every day, the raven would fly out of the tree to find food. When it got dark, the raven would come back to the tree to sleep.
One day, a little boy came to the tree. He wanted to see the raven. He looked up and saw the raven perched on a branch. The little boy tried to get closer to the tree, but it was too tall. So, he decided to sit down and wait. After a while, the raven flew down and landed on a branch close to the little boy. The little boy was so happy to see the raven up close.
As the sun started to set, the little boy knew he had to go home. He said goodbye to the raven and started to walk away. But then he remembered something. He turned around and ran back to the tree. He wanted to make sure the raven was safe. He looked up at the tree and saw that the raven had closed its eyes and was sleeping peacefully. The little boy smiled and went home, happy to have met the raven.
