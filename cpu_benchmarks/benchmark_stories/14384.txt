Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go to school because he had many friends there. One day, Timmy's teacher asked him to perform a magic trick in front of the class. Timmy was nervous, but he wanted to show his friends how amazing he was.
Timmy practiced his magic trick every day after school. Finally, the day of the performance arrived. Timmy got up in front of the class and began to perform his magic trick. But something went wrong, and the trick didn't work. Timmy was so embarrassed that he ran out of the school and never came back.
Timmy's friends missed him very much, but they never saw him again. The end.
