Once upon a time there was a stranger who came to stay with a family. She was very nice, but the family felt a bit strange around her. At first they were scared, but they soon learned to be nice and kind to her.
Every day the stranger played with the children, taught them new things and made them laugh. The children felt very happy and excited when she was around.
But then one day the stranger had to end her stay with the family and leave. The family was sad to say goodbye and the children felt very scared.
They were ashamed that they had ever felt scared of this stranger, who had done nothing but show them friendship and fun. They wanted her to stay and were so sorry when she had to go.
So they waved goodbye, with a very heavy heart, and watched as the stranger went away.
