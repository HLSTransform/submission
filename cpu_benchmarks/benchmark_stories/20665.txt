Max was walking through the forest. He was feeling brave and strong. Suddenly a paw jumped out at him. It scared him! But then he saw that it was just a fox.
Max calmed down and the fox started talking to him. He was an intelligent fox and wanted to be friends. Max smiled and the fox said he knew a secret about the forest. He said if Max gave him a hug, he would tell him the secret.
Max hugged the fox and he told him the secret. He said at night, the trees whisper stories! Max was so excited and wanted to see it for himself.
So the clever fox and Max explored the forest late into the night. Sure enough, they heard the trees whispering stories. It was so magical! Max and the fox were laughing and talking all night long. Max was so glad he wasn't scared of the fox's paw!
