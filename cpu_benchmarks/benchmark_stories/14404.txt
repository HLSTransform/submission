Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dress up in pretty clothes and take photos with her mommy's camera. One day, Lily's mommy told her they were going to a party. Lily was so excited to wear her smart dress and take lots of photos.
At the party, Lily played with her friends and ate yummy snacks. She even took a photo with the party clown. But then, something unexpected happened. Lily spilled juice on her smart dress! She was so sad and didn't want to take any more photos.
But then, Lily's mommy took out a surprise from her bag. It was a new dress for Lily to wear! And it was even prettier than her smart dress. Lily felt happy again and took lots of photos with her friends. She knew she would always have a special photo to remember that day.
