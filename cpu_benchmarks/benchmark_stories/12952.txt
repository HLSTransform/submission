Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally was very excited as it was dinner time. 
Sally's tummy was grumbling with hunger. She raced to the table, looking forward to dinner.
"Momma, what's for dinner?" Sally asked with excitement.
"Pasta!" Her Momma said with a big smile.
"Yay!" Sally said and clapped her hands.
Sally's Momma started to cook the pasta. While it was cooking, Sally was getting more and more excited.
Once the pasta was ready, Momma put a plate of pasta in front of Sally.
"It's time to eat," Momma said.
Sally took a bite and said "Mmmm, this pasta is the best! I demand more pasta please, Momma."
Momma was so happy that Sally liked her pasta so much, she put more on her plate.
Sally smiled, thanked her Momma, and continued to eat her yummy dinner.
