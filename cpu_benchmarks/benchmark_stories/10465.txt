Once upon a time there was a little boy. He had a penny which was very special because it was green. He was very excited to show it to his dad. He ran towards his dad, pointing at the penny and shouting "look, look!" His dad smiled and said "where did you find this?" The little boy was so excited to show the penny that he pointed to an old woman and said that she had given it to him. The old woman heard and got very angry. She waved her arms and shouted. The little boy was scared and started to cry. His dad tried to explain that the little boy had not stolen the penny, but the old woman didn't want to listen. She wanted her penny back and so the dad gave it to her. Then the old woman left, looking sad and angry. The little boy and his dad were very sad too. They never saw the old woman again and the little boy never saw his penny again.
