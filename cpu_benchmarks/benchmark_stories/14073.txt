Mia loved to pack. She liked to organize all of her toys and books into different bags and boxes. She even packed her lunch for school every day.
One day, Mia decided she wanted to build a hut. She asked her mom for some cardboard boxes and lots of tape. Mia worked hard to get the hut just right. She taped the boxes together tightly so the hut was very strong.
Mia gathered all of her favorite things - snuggly blankets, colorful books, and her stuffed animals - and put them in her hut. The cozy hut was perfect for her adventures and naps.
Mia was so proud of her hut. Every night before bed, she packed up all of her toys and books so they were arranged nicely in her hut. Mia loved her snug hut and always felt safe inside.
