One day, a boy named Tim saw a bright machine. The machine could read books. Tim wanted to use the machine, but he did not know how. He asked his friend, Sam, for help.
"Sam, can you help me use the machine?" Tim said. Sam looked at the machine and said, "I don't know how, but let's try together."
They tried to make the machine read a book, but it did not work. Tim and Sam felt sad. They wanted to hear the machine read a fun story.
Then, a girl named Sue saw them. She knew how to use the machine. Sue said, "I can help you!" She showed Tim and Sam how to turn on the machine. The machine started to read a fun story. Tim, Sam, and Sue were happy. They sat and listened to the story together.
