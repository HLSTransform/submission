Once upon a time there was a log. It was very cozy and harmless. One day a small chipmunk named Frank hopped on top of the log. He felt so comfy that he curled up and fell asleep. Suddenly, he started to shiver. It was cold outside and he needed a way to stay warm!
Frank noticed the sun was rising and felt the warmth on his back. He jumped off the log, ran towards the sunshine and was all cozy again.
Then, he remembered the log. He went back to check and saw that the log was still there, waiting for him. He knew that he could count on the log to keep him warm and cozy whenever he needed it. So, he hopped back on, wrapped himself up and fell asleep again.
