Once upon a time, there was a goat named Jack. He had a dream to travel around the world. One day, he decided to try to make his dream come true.
He said goodbye to his family and started his journey. He travelled through many different lands and saw many different things. After a long time, he was finally almost at the end of his adventure. 
One day, he arrived in a small village and asked for directions. He met a rude old man and asked for help. The old man laughed at him and said, "Go away goat, I will not help you!"
Jack was very sad and wanted to leave the village. But suddenly, an old woman came up to him and said, "Ignore the old man, Jack. I can help you find your way out of the village." 
Jack was very grateful to the old woman. She directed him in the right direction and soon, Jack was back on his travels. He continued on his journey until eventually, he reached the end of his journey and fulfilled his dream to travel around the world!
