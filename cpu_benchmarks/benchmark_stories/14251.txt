Once upon a time, there was a hairy monkey who lived in the jungle. Everyday, he would swing from the trees and play with his animal friends. But one day, the monkey wanted to go explore something new. So, he decided to leave the jungle and go on an adventure.
The monkey traveled far and wide, visiting many different places in his travels. He saw lots of exciting things, but he was happy to come back to the jungle. So, after a few days, the monkey returned back to his home.
When the monkey got back, all his animal friends were very happy. They had missed their hairy friend and were glad he had come back safe and sound.
The monkey was also very happy to be back home. He realized there was no place quite like the jungle. So, the hairy monkey never left again and enjoyed playing with his friends every day.
