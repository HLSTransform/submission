Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily looked up at the sky and saw a colorful rainbow. She wondered where it came from.
Lily ran to her friend Tommy and asked, "Do you see the pretty rainbow in the sky? Where did it come from?"
Tommy replied, "I don't know, but it's so pretty! Let's go find the end of the rainbow."
Lily and Tommy ran through the park, searching for the end of the rainbow. They looked everywhere, but they couldn't find it. Finally, they sat down on the grass and looked up at the colorful rainbow. Lily said, "Even though we didn't find the end of the rainbow, it's still so pretty to look at." Tommy agreed and they both smiled, happy to have seen such a beautiful sight.
