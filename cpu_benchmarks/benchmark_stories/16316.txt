Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big, fluffy teddy bear named Mr. Snuggles. One day, Lily promised Mr. Snuggles that they would have a tea party together.
But then, Lily's mom told her they had to go to the store. Lily was sad because she didn't want to break her promise to Mr. Snuggles. She asked her mom if she could bring Mr. Snuggles to the store with them.
Mom said yes, and Lily was so happy! She brought Mr. Snuggles to the store and they had a great time together. When they got home, Lily kept her promise and had a tea party with Mr. Snuggles. It was the best day ever!
