Once there was a little girl called Sarah. She was very curious and wanted to explore the world around her. One day she saw a picture of a colorful fish. She wanted to see a real fish, so she asked her mom. Her mom said, "You need to be very careful, let's go to the pond and see if you can find a fish".
Sarah was very excited, so they went to the pond. Soon, Sarah spotted a real fish. She was amazed! She watched carefully as the fish swam around. Sarah began to mind her surrounding, taking in all the beauty that was around her.
Soon, a big colourful butterfly flew around Sarah. She was mesmerized. She had never seen something so beautiful before. As she watched, the butterfly flew away. Sarah was sad that she couldn't keep it, but she was also happy for having seen it.
Sarah learned an important lesson that day. She learned that if she was very careful and used her mind to explore, she could discover amazing things in her world.
