Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big bridge over a river. They wanted to cross the bridge and see what was on the other side.
They asked their mom if they could go. Mom said yes, but be careful and hold hands. Lily and Ben were happy and ran to the bridge. They started to walk on the bridge, but it was very high and shaky. Lily felt dizzy and scared. She stopped and held Ben's hand tighter.
Ben saw that Lily was dizzy and scared. He said, "Don't worry, Lily. I'm here with you. Let's pray to God and ask Him to help us cross the bridge. God loves us and He will keep us safe."
Lily nodded and closed her eyes. She prayed to God and asked Him to help them cross the bridge. She felt a warm and calm feeling in her heart. She opened her eyes and smiled at Ben. Ben smiled back and said, "Let's go, Lily. We can do it."
They walked slowly and carefully on the bridge, holding hands and praying to God. They reached the other side and saw a beautiful park with flowers and trees. They thanked God for helping them cross the bridge and for the beautiful park. They played and had fun until mom came to pick them up. They hugged mom and told her about their adventure. Mom was proud of them and said, "You are very brave and faithful, Lily and Ben. God is always with you and He answers your prayers."
