Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she was eating her dinner and her mom put some cauliflower on her plate. Lily didn't like cauliflower, so she made a serious face and said, "Mom, I don't like this."
Her mom replied, "Lily, you need to mind your manners and try new foods. Cauliflower is good for you."
Lily thought about it for a moment and decided to take a small bite. To her surprise, she actually liked it! She said, "Mom, this cauliflower is yummy! Can I have more please?"
Her mom smiled and gave her more cauliflower. From that day on, Lily always tried new foods and didn't mind eating cauliflower anymore.
