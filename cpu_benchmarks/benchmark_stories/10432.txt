Once upon a time there was a boy who wanted to go to the park. He asked his parents if he could go and they said yes, but only if he was careful. The boy was very excited! He put on his shoes and filled his pockets with snacks.
He waved goodbye to his parents as he left the house. He walked down the street and soon he could see the park. He was jumping up and down with happiness. But then he remembered that his parents had been anxious when they had permitted him to go. He began to worry that he was not being careful enough.
He stopped and remembered all of the safety rules his parents had told him. He crossed the street at the crossing lights, and walked slowly, listening carefully for any cars that might be around.
The boy was relieved when he arrived at the park and felt confident that he had been careful. He sat down on the swing and smiled, glad that he had been permitted to come.
