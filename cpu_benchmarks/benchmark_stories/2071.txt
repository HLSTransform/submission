Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to read magazines. He would always ask his mommy to buy him a new one every time they went to the store.
One day, Timmy's mommy bought him a magazine about animals. Timmy was very excited to read it. But mommy told him that some animals can be dangerous and he should be careful.
Timmy asked his mommy, "How can I be safe from dangerous animals?" His mommy replied, "We can prepare by learning about them and staying away from them."
From that day on, Timmy read his magazine every day and learned about all the animals. He knew which ones were dangerous and which ones were not. Timmy felt safe and happy knowing that he was prepared.
