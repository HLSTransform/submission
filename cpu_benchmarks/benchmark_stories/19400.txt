Once upon a time, there was a bright pumpkin. It was bright orange, and it sat on a big green hill. But one day, the pumpkin was in trouble. A big group of crows had come, and they were trying to take it away.
The pumpkin was scared! But then, a brave boy came and saved it. He was tall and strong, and he chased the crows away. The boy rescued the pumpkin!
Back at the boy's house, the pumpkin was very happy. It glowed so bright that it lit up the whole room. And the boy, he was so proud of his pumpkin. He hugged it and thanked it for being so brave.
The bright pumpkin was safe, and it was happy. The boy promised to take care of it forever, and the pumpkin promised to always stay bright.
