Once upon a time there was a girl called Emily. Emily was three years old and she lived with her family. Every day Emily would go outside and play. One day, Emily was being very careless and not looking where she was going. Suddenly, she tripped and fell onto the ground! Emily was not hurt and she quickly got back up again. Suddenly she noticed something on the ground - it was a picture! Emily was so happy she had received a picture. She picked it up and took it home.
When Emily got back, she showed her picture to her family. They were so happy to see what Emily had received. Emily's mom gave her a big hug and said, "That was very lucky Emily! Thank you for being so careful". From then on Emily was very cautious when playing outside! Emily and her family kept the picture for a long time and looked at it often. They all loved the picture and were so happy she had received it that day.
