Once there was a little boy who loved to perform. He practiced every day and had lots of fun. He's gotten very good at it!
One day he found a chain. It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. He put it around his neck and started to perform. He sang and danced and twirled around.
But then he started to feel something strange. The chain was bitter on his skin. He stopped and touched it. The chain felt strange and cold.
He put it back in the exact spot he had found it. He knew he wasn't supposed to have it. He decided it was best to leave it there.
The little boy danced and sang without the chain, feeling happy and free. He was still performing, but he was doing it without that bitter chain.
