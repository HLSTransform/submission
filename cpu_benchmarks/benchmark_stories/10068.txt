Anna loved rice. She ate it every day with her mom and dad. Sometimes she had rice with chicken, sometimes with fish, sometimes with soup. She liked all kinds of rice.
One day, Anna went to the park with her mom. She saw some ducks in the pond. She wanted to feed them. She asked her mom if she could give them some rice. Her mom said no. She said rice was not good for ducks. She said ducks could get sick from rice. She said Anna should only feed them bread or seeds.
But Anna did not listen. She was curious. She wanted to see what the ducks would do with rice. She took some rice from her lunch box and threw it in the pond. The ducks came to eat it. They made loud noises. They looked happy.
Anna felt happy too. She threw more rice in the pond. She laughed and clapped. She did not see her mom's angry face. She did not hear her mom's warning voice.
Then something bad happened. One of the ducks started to choke. It made a strange sound. It flapped its wings. It splashed in the water. It looked scared. Anna felt scared too. She stopped throwing rice. She ran to her mom. She cried and said sorry.
Her mom hugged her and said it was okay. She said Anna did not know. She said Anna should not do it again. She said Anna should learn from her mistake. She said Anna should be kind to animals.
Anna nodded and said yes. She looked at the duck. It was still choking. It looked sad. Anna felt sad too. She wished she had not thrown rice. She wished she had listened to her mom. She regretted what she had done. She hoped the duck would be okay. She learned a lesson. She never fed rice to ducks again.
