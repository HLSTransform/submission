Mum and Dad were driving in their car, when they saw a deer. "Look, look!" said Mum, pointing at the deer. The deer was carefully walking alongside the road, but then it started to run away down the road. "Quick, let's zoom after it" said Dad, and he started to drive faster.
Mum and Dad followed the deer down the road, with the car zooming along. But the deer was going too fast and soon it was hard to see. "Where did it go?" shouted Dad, as he drove around a corner. Suddenly Mum and Dad heard a loud crash.
Carefully, they got out of the car. The deer had run right into a big tree, and it was lying on the ground. The deer was in agony, with one of its legs twisted and broken. "Oh, it's so sad," said Mum, her eyes welling up with tears.
Dad was feeling very sad as well, so he got very careful. He brought his coat over and gently put it over the deer. The deer breathed its last and died. Mum and Dad felt very sad, and they silently drove away from the scene.
