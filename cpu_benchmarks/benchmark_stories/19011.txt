Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emily. She had a pretty vest that her mommy gave her. Emily loved her vest very much and wore it every day. One day, Emily went to the park to play with her friends. While playing, she accidentally spilled juice on her vest. She felt very embarrassed because her vest was now dirty.
Emily's friend, Lily, saw that Emily was sad and asked her what happened. Emily told her about the juice and how her vest was now dirty. Lily said, "Don't worry, Emily. It's just a vest. It can be washed and cleaned." Emily felt better and thanked her friend for making her feel better.
The moral of the story is that material things like vests are not as important as having good friends who can make you feel better when you feel poor or embarrassed.
