Tommy was a very intelligent little boy. He loved to play video games with his friends. One day his friends were too busy, so Tommy had to play by himself. He was eager to beat the level he was on and he tried his best. But he just couldn't do it!
Suddenly, his mom came in and told him it was time to rest. He knew she was right, but he was so determined to beat the level. He started to argue with his mom, but she wasn't budging. No matter how hard he tried he couldn't keep playing.
So finally, Tommy had to turn off the video game and rest. He was disappointed, but his mom was pleased. She knew that even intelligent boys like Tommy needed a break sometimes.
