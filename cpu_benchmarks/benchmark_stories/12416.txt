Once upon a time, there was a little brown mouse who lived in a big chimney. One day, the mouse had a special request. He wanted to have a friend to play with. He peered out of the chimney and looked around.
Just then, the mouse saw a small brown bird perched on a nearby tree. The mouse peered at the bird and called out, "Hey! Can you be my friend?"
The bird thought for a moment, then replied, "Yes! I would like that."
The mouse and the bird played together for a long time. They both had lots of fun! They raced and hide and seek, and ran through the grass in the sunshine.
From that day forward, the mouse and the bird were the best of friends. They played together every day and were never apart. 
The end.
