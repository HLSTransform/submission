Once there was a little yellow cat. He was so small, he could only crawl. He was searching for a new place to live.
He saw a garage and crawled his way inside. He noticed that it was dark and very quiet. He curled up on the floor, feeling cozy and warm.
Then something moved! It was big and hairy. The cat became scared. He wanted to run away, but he had no where to go.
But then the hairy thing spoke! It said, "Hello! I'm a friendly dog! Would you like to be my friend?"
The little yellow cat was so relieved. He had found a new place to call home. He crawled closer to the friendly dog and they became the best of friends. They both lived happily ever after in the big, warm garage. The end.
