Once upon a time there was a little girl named Julie. She wanted to be a brave motorcyclist, so she asked her mommy for a helmet. Her mommy said yes and Julie was so excited. She put her helmet on and sat on her toy motorcycle. She pretended to go really fast, but she was actually going very slow.
But then, she started to feel really tired. Even though she wanted to go fast, she just couldn't keep going. So she quitted and took off her helmet. She thought and thought, and finally came up with an idea. She decided to take a break and take a nap first before she rode her motorcycle again. So she took a nap and then put her helmet back on when she woke up.
Now Julie was ready to go fast! She rode around and around on her toy motorcycle, going faster and faster. She even screamed out loud with joy and excitement! After a while, she was so proud of herself for not quitting. She could be the best motorcyclist ever!
