Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went outside to gather some pretty flowers for her mommy. She saw lots of colorful flowers, like red roses and yellow daisies. She picked them all and put them in a big vase.
Later that day, it started to rain and the ground got very icy. Lily's mommy asked her to help mop up the water that came inside. Lily got a big mop and started to clean up the floor. She was very careful not to slip on the icy water. 
After they finished mopping, Lily's mommy thanked her for helping. Lily felt happy that she could do something nice for her mommy. She looked at the pretty flowers she gathered earlier and smiled.
