Anna and Ben were playing in the park with their toy animals. They liked to pretend they were explorers in the jungle. Anna had a leopard and Ben had a monkey.
"Look, a leopard!" Anna said, holding up her toy. "He is fast and strong and has spots."
"Can I see?" Ben asked, reaching for the leopard.
Anna did not want to share. She pulled the leopard away from Ben. "No, he is mine. You have your monkey."
Ben felt sad and angry. He wanted to play with the leopard too. He pulled the monkey close to him. "Fine, I don't need your leopard. My monkey is better. He is smart and funny and dependable."
Anna and Ben stopped talking to each other. They turned away and played by themselves. They did not have fun.
After a while, they heard a loud noise. It was a big dog, barking and running towards them. The dog looked mean and hungry. Anna and Ben were scared. They did not know what to do.
"Help!" Anna cried, holding her leopard.
"Help!" Ben echoed, clutching his monkey.
The dog came closer and closer. Anna and Ben wished they had someone to protect them. They looked at each other. They remembered they were friends.
"Let's stick together!" Anna said, giving Ben her leopard.
"Let's share our toys!" Ben said, giving Anna his monkey.
Anna and Ben hugged their toys and each other. They felt brave and happy. The dog saw them and stopped. He did not like their toys. He turned around and ran away.
Anna and Ben smiled and laughed. They learned to share and be kind. They played with their leopard and monkey together. They had fun.
