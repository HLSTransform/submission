Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat oatmeal for breakfast every day. He would always ask his mommy to make him a big bowl of oatmeal with honey on top. 
One day, Timmy went to visit his friend Johnny. Johnny was a very generous friend and always shared his toys with Timmy. Timmy was happy to have such a good friend. 
But sometimes, Timmy didn't behave very well. He would sometimes take Johnny's toys without asking or throw tantrums when he didn't get his way. Johnny didn't like it when Timmy didn't behave, but he still wanted to be friends. 
So, Johnny decided to talk to Timmy about how important it is to behave and be kind to others. Timmy listened and promised to try his best to behave from now on. And just like that, Timmy and Johnny continued to be good friends and eat oatmeal together every morning. The end.
