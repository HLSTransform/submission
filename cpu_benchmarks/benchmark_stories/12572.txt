Lily and Tom were twins. They liked to play outside in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They gave him a carrot nose and two buttons for eyes.
But Lily lost one of her gloves. She was sad. Her hand was cold and wet. She looked everywhere for her glove, but she could not find it. She asked Tom to help her, but he did not see it either.
They decided to go back home and ask Mom for a new glove. They walked to the store with Mom. Mom said they had to be obedient and stay close to her. There were many people and cars in the street. It was noisy and busy.
In the store, they saw many gloves. They were different colors and sizes. Lily picked a pink glove with a flower on it. She tried it on and it fit her hand. She was happy. She thanked Mom and gave her a hug.
But then she saw something on the shelf. It was her other glove! It was the same as the one she lost. She wondered how it got there. Maybe someone found it in the snow and brought it to the store. She was surprised and glad. She took her old glove and put it in her pocket. She had two gloves again. She showed Tom and he smiled.
They left the store with Mom. They wore their gloves and waved to the snowman. They were warm and cozy. They had a fun day.
