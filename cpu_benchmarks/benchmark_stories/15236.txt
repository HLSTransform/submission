Once upon a time, there was a creative boy named Tim. He loved to play with his toys and make up fun games. One day, he found a shiny toy called a laser. The laser was very special and could make pretty colors on the wall.
Tim had a lot of fun playing with the laser. He liked to make the colors dance and spin around. But Tim's mom told him to be careful. She said the laser could burn things if he was not careful with it.
Tim listened to his mom and played with the laser safely. He was very creative and made up new games to play with it. All the kids in the neighborhood loved to watch Tim's colorful laser show. Everyone was happy, and Tim learned how to have fun with his laser while being safe.
