One day, a little girl woke up feeling very restless. She knew she needed to escape. She thought about where she could go. With a smile, she knew that the beach would be perfect. 
Quickly, she put on her bathing suit and grabbed her beach ball. With a skip, she ran out of the door and to the beach. 
As the little girl stepped onto the sand, she could feel the warmth of the sun. She smiled and took off her shoes. She started to run, kick and even jump in the sand.
The little girl was so happy to be free. She bounced, tossed, and ran all around the beach. The ocean was cold and she laughed and screamed everytime a wave splashed her.
Soon, it was time to go home. The little girl was glad to have escaped, and she felt an inner peace. She knew she could always go back to the beach and feel free again.
