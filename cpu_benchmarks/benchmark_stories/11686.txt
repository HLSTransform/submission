Once upon a time there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was only three years old and wasn't sure how to feel.
She saw people wearing masks everywhere she went. She was confused and a little nervous. What did the masks mean and why were people wearing them?
One day, Daisy's mommy told her that the masks were to help keep people safe. Daisy didn't understand, so she asked her mom for help.
Her mom explained that the masks help keep germs away from our nose and mouths. When we wear them, we don't get too close to each other and help keep everyone healthy.
Daisy felt a bit better and less nervous when she understood why people were wearing masks.
