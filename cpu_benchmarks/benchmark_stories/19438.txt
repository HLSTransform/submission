Once upon a time there was a melon. It was very big and colourful. The melon liked to play with the other fruit in the garden. One day, the melon wanted to climb a big tree. But he was worried. He was afraid he might slip and fall.
Suddenly, a big bird came and offered to help the melon. The bird said, “Climb onto my back. I will help you reach the top of the tree.” The melon was still a bit scared but he decided to take the bird’s help.
The bird carried the melon carefully to the top of the tree. The melon was so happy. He said a big thank you to the bird and the bird flew away. From the top of the tree, the melon could see a lot of colourful flowers. He jumped from flower to flower, enjoying the view. His worries were gone.
