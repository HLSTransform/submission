Lily and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. Lily had a lot of stuff: dolls, cars, blocks, books. Ben had only one toy: a teddy bear. He loved his teddy bear very much.
"Can I play with your doll?" Ben asked Lily.
"No, it's mine!" Lily said. She was rude. She did not like to share her stuff.
Ben felt sad. He hugged his teddy bear. He wished he had more stuff to play with.
Lily saw Ben's teddy bear. It looked soft and cute. She wanted it.
"Can I play with your teddy bear?" Lily asked Ben.
Ben was nice. He liked to share his stuff.
"Okay, you can play with it for a little bit," Ben said. He offered his teddy bear to Lily.
Lily took the teddy bear. She smiled. She did not say thank you. She did not give Ben any of her stuff.
Ben waited for Lily to give him back his teddy bear. He waited and waited. He missed his teddy bear.
Lily played with the teddy bear. She did not care about Ben. She did not want to give him back his teddy bear.
She tried to hide the teddy bear under a pillow. She hoped Ben would forget about it.
But Ben did not forget. He saw the teddy bear under the pillow. He was angry.
He went to Lily and said, "Give me back my teddy bear! It's mine!"
Lily said, "No, it's mine now! I like it more than you!"
They started to fight. They pulled and pushed the teddy bear. They yelled and cried.
Mom heard the noise. She came to the living room. She saw Lily and Ben fighting over the teddy bear.
She was not happy. She scolded them.
She said, "Lily, you are rude. You did not share your stuff with Ben. You did not say thank you when he offered you his teddy bear. You did not give it back to him. You tried to take it from him. That is not nice."
She said, "Ben, you are nice. You shared your stuff with Lily. You offered her your teddy bear. You waited for her to give it back to you. You did not try to take it from her. That is nice."
She took the teddy bear from Lily and gave it back to Ben.
She said, "Lily, you need to say sorry to Ben. And you need to share your stuff with him. Or you will not play with any stuff at all."
Lily felt bad. She said sorry to Ben. She offered him her doll. She said, "Do you want to play with my doll?"
Ben felt good. He said thank you to Lily. He offered her his teddy bear. He said, "Do you want to play with my teddy bear?"
They smiled. They hugged. They played with their stuff together.
Mom smiled. She was happy. She said, "That's better. Now you are nice to each other. Sharing is caring."
