The little boy was having a hard day. He was so tired and wanted to relax.
Luckily, he saw a cozy room. It was quiet, with a comfy bed full of pillows. He went inside and lay down on the bed. 
He closed his eyes and imagined he had wings. The room felt so peaceful it made him feel very lucky and relaxed.
The little boy sighed and fell asleep, feeling more relaxed than he had all day. 
When he woke up, his day was brighter and he felt much better. That lucky cozy room was just what he had needed.
