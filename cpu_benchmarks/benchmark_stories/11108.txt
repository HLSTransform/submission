Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toy gears. He had big gears and small gears, and he would work hard to make them fit together.
One sunny day, Tim met a new friend, Sam. Sam was enthusiastic about the gears and wanted to play with Tim. They both sat down and started to work together. "Look, Tim! We can make the gears move faster when we work together!" said Sam.
As they played, they learned that working together made everything more fun. Tim and Sam became best friends, and they always worked together to make their gears spin. The moral of the story is that working together can make things easier and more enjoyable.
