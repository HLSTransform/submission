One day, a little boy named Tim found a big red button in his toy box. He didn't know what the button did, so he asked his mom, "Mom, what does this button do?"
His mom said, "I don't know, Tim. Why don't you press it and see what happens?"
Tim pressed the button and suddenly, his toy car started to zoom around the room. It went so fast that it made Tim laugh. He chased the car as it zoomed under the table and around the chairs.
Tim's mom saw how much fun he was having, so she made some tasty cookies for him to eat. She called Tim over and said, "Tim, come eat these tasty cookies!"
Tim stopped playing with his zooming car and sat down to eat the cookies. He shared them with his mom, and they both enjoyed the tasty treat. After they finished eating, Tim went back to play with his zooming car and the big red button.
