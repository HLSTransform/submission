Lily and Max were very happy. They were going to visit their grandma and grandpa. They loved their grandma and grandpa. They always played with them and gave them hugs and kisses.
They got in the car with their mom and dad. They drove for a long time. They saw many things on the way. They saw cows and horses and trees and flowers. They sang songs and played games.
When they arrived, their grandma and grandpa were waiting for them. They ran to them and hugged them. "Hello, my sweeties!" grandma said. "We missed you so much!" grandpa said. They went inside the house. It smelled very good. Grandma had made cookies and cake. They ate some and drank milk.
After that, they went to the living room. There was a big TV and a sofa. Grandma and grandpa had a surprise for them. They had a big bowl of popcorn. "Do you want to watch a movie with us?" grandma asked. "Yes, please!" Lily and Max said. They loved popcorn. They sat on the sofa with their grandma and grandpa. They covered themselves with a blanket.
They watched a movie about animals. There were lions and elephants and monkeys and birds. They were very funny and cute. Lily and Max laughed and clapped. But then, they saw something unknown. It was a big and scary animal. It had sharp teeth and claws. It roared and chased the other animals. Lily and Max were afraid. They hid behind their grandma and grandpa. "What is that?" Lily asked. "That is a crocodile," grandpa said. "It lives in the water and eats meat. But don't worry, it can't hurt you. It is only on the TV." He hugged them and kissed them. "You are safe with us," he said. Lily and Max felt better. They watched the rest of the movie. They saw the crocodile go away and the other animals be happy. They were happy too. They loved their grandma and grandpa. They loved their visit.
