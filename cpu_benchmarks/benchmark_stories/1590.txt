Anna and Ben were playing in the yard. They had a big pile of leaves that they raked with their rake. They liked to jump in the leaves and make them fly in the air.
"Look at me, Anna!" Ben said. "I can do a flip in the leaves!"
Ben ran and jumped and did a flip. He landed on his back in the leaves. He smiled and laughed.
"You are so good, Ben!" Anna said. "You are graceful like a bird!"
Anna wanted to try too. She ran and jumped and did a flip. But she did not land in the leaves. She landed in a puddle of water. She got wet and cold. She cried and shivered.
"Oh no, Anna!" Ben said. "You are soaked! You need a towel and a hug!"
Ben ran to the house and got a towel. He wrapped it around Anna and gave her a hug. He said he was sorry for the puddle.
"It's okay, Ben," Anna said. "It was an accident. You are a good brother."
They went inside the house and had some hot cocoa. They were happy and warm. They still liked to play in the leaves, but they watched out for puddles.
