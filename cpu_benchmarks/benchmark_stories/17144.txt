Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cold and her nose was runny. Her mommy told her to stay in bed and rest.
Lily was bored and wanted to play. She saw her teddy bear and said, "Teddy, do you want to play with me?"
Teddy replied, "Yes, I want to play with you. What do you want to play?"
Lily thought for a moment and said, "Let's play doctor. I will be the doctor and you will be the patient. You have a headache and I will check your skull."
Teddy agreed and Lily checked his skull. She said, "Teddy, you don't have a headache. You are just pretending."
Teddy laughed and they continued to play until Lily fell asleep.
