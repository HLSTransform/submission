Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue had a best friend named Tim. They liked to play together every day. One day, Sue saw a pretty black purse in her mommy's room. She thought it would be fun to play with.
Sue asked her mommy, "Can I play with the black purse?" Her mommy said, "Yes, but be careful with it. And don't lose it." Sue was very happy and took the black purse outside to show Tim.
When Tim saw the black purse, he wanted to play with it too. Sue said, "I can lend it to you, but you have to give it back." Tim agreed and they took turns playing with the black purse. They had a lot of fun and at the end of the day, they gave the purse back to Sue's mommy. Sue and Tim were happy they could play with the black purse, and they promised to take good care of it next time.
