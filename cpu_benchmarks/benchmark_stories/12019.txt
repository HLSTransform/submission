Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and chase butterflies. One day, she saw a big dog with a mask on its face. The mask looked funny, but Lily was scared of the dog.
Lily ran away, but the dog followed her. She didn't know what to do, so she hid behind a tree. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. It was her tummy! She realized she was hungry and had forgotten to eat her lunch.
Lily remembered her mom's advice to always carry a tasty snack. She searched her pockets and found a granola bar. She opened it and took a bite. The dog smelled the tasty snack and came closer. Lily gained the courage to share her snack with the dog, and they became friends. From that day on, Lily and the dog played together every day.
