Once upon a time there was a tired little girl. She had been up all night and was still awake when the sun rose. The bright sunrise shone in her eyes and she groaned, rubbing her eyes.
The little girl's mom walked into her bedroom and gently said, "Good morning, sweetheart! It's time to wake up".
But the little girl was very cranky and so she yelled, "No! I don't want to wake up!".
Mom was mad and shook her head. "That's not nice. I'm sorry that you're feeling so grumpy but you have to get up if you want breakfast."
The little girl grumbled and slowly rose from bed, stretching her arms and yawning. Mom watched her with a smile and said, "See, that's better. Now let's get you some food". 
The little girl and her mom held hands and walked into the kitchen for delicious breakfast. With a full tummy and bright sunshine, the little girl soon forgot all about the grumpy morning and mom smiled, knowing life begins with a new sunrise.
