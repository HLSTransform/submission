Once upon a time there was a brave little girl. Her name was Lily and she was very independent. 
One day, her mom gave her a special mission. She put an iron in Lily's hands and said, "Lily, I dare you to iron your own clothes!"
Lily was so excited. She knew it would take practice, but she was determined to succeed. She spent every day ironing her own clothes. She didn't give up.
Finally, one day she did it! She had learned how to iron without help from anyone. She had done it all by herself, and she was proud.
From then on, Lily was known as a very independent girl who was proud to conquer the challenge of ironing her own clothes. The end.
