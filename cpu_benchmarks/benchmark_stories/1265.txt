One day, the sky was very cloudy. The clouds were deep grey and looked heavy. All of a sudden, the sky started to shine! The sun shone through the clouds and lit up the sky.
The sun was so bright and it was so warm. The clouds started to melt from the heat and the sky began to fill with tiny droplets. They looked like little diamonds sparkiling in the bright light. 
The tiny droplets made everything wet. Little kids went outside to play in the wet. They danced around in the rain, ran through the puddles and jumped into the mud. 
The sun shone for the entire day, until the clouds took over the sky once more. Then, the rain stopped and everything went back to normal. But the kids will always remember the bright and sunny day when the sky shone!
