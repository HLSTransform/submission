Once upon a time, there was a grumpy bear. He spent all of his time walking through the tall grass near his home. He never smiled and was always in a bad mood.
One day, the bear found a little chick in the grass. The chick was lost and alone, and the bear felt sorry for it. He picked up the chick and held it in his arms. The bear felt his grumpiness melting away.
The bear didn't want to keep the chick, instead he opened his hands and released it. The chick flew away and  was happy to have its freedom.
The moral of the story is that there is joy in releasing something, even if we don't get anything in return. The bear was grumpy before, but by letting the chick go, he was happier than before!
