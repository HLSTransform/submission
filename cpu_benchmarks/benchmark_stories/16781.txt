Lily and Max were very enthusiastic. They were going on a trip with Mom and Dad. They packed their bags with toys, books and snacks. They put on their hats and coats and got in the car.
The car drove for a long time. Lily and Max looked out the window and saw trees, houses and animals. They sang songs and played games. They asked Mom and Dad, "Are we there yet?" many times.
Finally, the car arrived at the farm. Lily and Max jumped out of the car and ran to the gate. They saw cows, sheep, pigs and chickens. They heard them moo, baa, oink and cluck. They smelled hay, grass and mud.
Mom and Dad smiled and followed them. They met the farmer and his wife. They said hello and thank you. They gave them a basket of fresh eggs and milk. They invited them to see the barn and the fields.
Lily and Max were very happy. They loved the farm. They petted the animals, fed them carrots and apples, and rode on a tractor. They had a lot of fun on their trip. They said they wanted to come back soon.
