One day, Bob saw a stone and wanted to lift it up. He used all his strength but it was too heavy. He was very persistent.
Bob’s mom came along and said, “Bob, that’s too heavy for you. Please don’t hurt yourself!”
But Bob refused to listen. He kept trying to lift the stone. Finally, his mom said, “Alright, I’ll help you if you promise to be careful.”
So with his mom’s help, Bob was able to lift the stone. He smiled with joy and ran all the way home.
When they arrived home, Bob was exhausted. He put the stone down and thanked his mom. His mom said, “See, I told you it was too heavy for you. You have to learn to be more persistent and listen to me.”
Bob nodded, understanding the lesson his mom was trying to teach him. From then on, Bob was more aware of how much he could and could not lift.
