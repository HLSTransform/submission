Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys all day long. He had a big collection of cars, trucks, and planes. Timmy's mom would always tell him to be patient when he got upset because he couldn't find his favorite toy.
One day, Timmy's teacher read a poem in class about sharing. The poem said that when we share our toys with others, we make new friends and everyone is happy. Timmy thought about the poem and decided to share his toys with his friends at school.
When Timmy shared his toys, he made new friends and had even more fun playing. Timmy learned that sharing is important and that it's okay to be patient when things don't go our way. From that day on, Timmy always shared his toys and was a happy boy.
