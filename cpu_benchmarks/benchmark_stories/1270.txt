Once upon a time there was a ranch. It had lots of animals and plants growing on the land. Every day the animals would print all over the land, eating the yummy plants.
One day, there was a special plant that was growing. It looked very weird, and the animals were curious. They wanted to see what it was so they went over to take a closer look.
The plant was very sour when they tasted it! The animals were so surprised at how sour it was and they quickly printed away.
That day, the animals decided to stay away from the sour plant. They knew it was best to avoid the sour plant so they never got close to it again!
