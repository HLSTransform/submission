Gramps was at dinner eating his food. He took a bite and suddenly he began to feel very ill. He looked at Grandma and she knew something was wrong. She asked him what happened and he pointed to the bowl of food.
Grandma slowly took a spoonful of the food and tasted it. Her eyes widened and she nodded. "This has poison in it," she said. Gramps was very worried and quickly grabbed his stomach.
Grandma quickly took out some medicine and gave it to Gramps. She told him to drink it and he did. After a few minutes, Gramps began to feel better. He smiled and nodded at Grandma. She smiled back, knowing that she had found the perfect thing to save Gramps.
