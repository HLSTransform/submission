Once upon a time, there was a big garden with many pretty flowers. A naughty rabbit lived in the garden and loved to eat the flowers. One day, the rabbit saw a shiny bulb and wanted it for himself. He stole it from the ground and ran away.
The flowers in the garden were very sad because they loved the bulb too. They didn't understand why the rabbit would take it away. A wise old owl saw what happened and explained to the flowers that the rabbit was ignorant and didn't know that stealing was wrong.
The flowers forgave the rabbit, but they also taught him a lesson. They told him that it's not nice to take things that don't belong to you. The rabbit felt sorry and promised to never steal again. From that day on, the rabbit and the flowers became good friends and played together in the garden.
