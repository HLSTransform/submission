One day, a girl named Sally wanted to bake a cake. She went to the kitchen and got all the things she needed. She mixed the cake stuff in a big bowl. Sally was very happy because she loved to bake.
At night, Sally's mom put the cake in the oven. The cake baked and baked. It made the whole house warm. Sally could not wait to eat the cake with her family.
When the cake was done, it was smelly. But it was a good smelly cake. Sally, her mom, and her dad all ate the cake together. They laughed and had fun. Sally was happy she baked the smelly cake.
