Once upon a time there was a girl named Mary. Mary was very sad and she wanted to find someone who could make her feel better. So, she went to the doctor's office and asked the nurse if she could help. 
The nurse smiled and said, "of course I can help you, come sit down and talk with me." Mary hesitantly sat down and sighed. She was feeling so far away and distant. 
The kind nurse asked Mary a lot of questions and Mary answered by telling the nurse all of her worries. The nurse told Mary that it was ok to feel these feelings, but they had to find a way to make Mary feel better. So the nurse and Mary talked and talked until Mary started to feel better. 
At the end, Mary smiled and hugged the nurse as a thank you for being so helpful. She was so glad to have someone to share her feelings and worries with. The nurse smiled back and said, "You are welcome here anytime, Mary." 
And with that, Mary said goodbye and waved to the nurse. She felt so much better and knew that she could come back any time if she ever felt distant and sad again.
