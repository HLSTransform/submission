Once upon a time, there was a nice man. The man had a big present. He wanted to give the present to the sky.
So one day, the man walked up to the sky with the big present. He put the big present in the sky. The sky was very happy.
The sky said “Thank you for the nice present!” The man said, “You're welcome!”
The man gave the sky a hug. The sky hugged him back. Then they both smiled.
The man and the sky were very happy. They had a nice day.
