Lily liked to play the flute. She had a small flute that made nice sounds when she blew into it. She played the flute every day in her room. She felt happy and peaceful when she played.
One day, her brother Tom came into her room. He was bored and wanted to play with Lily. He saw her flute and grabbed it. He said, "Let me play with this. It looks fun."
Lily was angry and scared. She did not want Tom to take her flute. She said, "No, Tom, that is mine. Give it back. You don't know how to play it. You will break it."
Tom did not listen. He blew into the flute very hard. He made a loud and ugly noise. He laughed and said, "This is easy. I can play better than you."
Lily started to cry. She wanted her flute back. She said, "Tom, please, stop. You are hurting my flute. You are hurting my ears. You are hurting my feelings."
Tom saw that Lily was crying. He felt sorry and ashamed. He realized that he was being mean and selfish. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. Here, take your flute. I won't touch it again."
He gave the flute back to Lily. Lily stopped crying. She looked at her flute and saw that it was not broken. She was relieved and grateful. She said, "Thank you, Tom. I forgive you. Do you want to play something else with me?"
Tom nodded and smiled. He said, "Yes, Lily. I want to play with you. You are my sister and I love you."
They hugged each other and went to play with their toys. They felt happy and peaceful again. They learned to share and respect each other's things. They played the flute together and made nice sounds.
