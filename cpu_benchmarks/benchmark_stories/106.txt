Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a field full of corn. The corn was very tall and yellow. The farmer was bald and he liked to walk in his field every day. One day, he saw a little bird on a branch. The bird was trying to balance on the branch but it was too small. The farmer felt sorry for the bird, so he picked it up and put it on his head. The bird felt happy and started to sing. The farmer was happy too, because he had a new friend. They walked together in the cornfield and enjoyed the sunshine.
