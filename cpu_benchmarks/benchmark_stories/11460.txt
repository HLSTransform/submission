One sunny day, a harmless bunny was hop-hop-hopping through the woods. The bunny had been warned not to go too far, so it decided to take a break and rest for a moment. Suddenly, it heard the sound of a horn. The bunny had never heard such a sound before so it got scared. 
The bunny hopped closer and closer to the sound. As it got closer, it noticed that the sound was coming from a harmless two-legged creature. The two-legged creature was holding a horn that looked like a toy. The bunny waited with anticipation to see what the harmless creature would do.
The creature put the horn to its lips and blew. The sound reverberated through the woods and made the bunny feel much happier. The bunny realized that the harmess creature had created the sound for joy, not for danger. It felt relieved and hopped along to the same rhythm as the sound of the horn. 
The bunny began to hope that it could once again hear the sound of the harmless creature's horn in the woods. But the next time it heard the sound, it wouldn't be so scared. It would know the creature was blowing it with joy.
