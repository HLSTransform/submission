Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big bird with a red head and a yellow beak. It was a woodpecker. The woodpecker was looking for food in the trees.
"Look, Lily, a woodpecker!" Tom said. "It makes a loud noise with its beak."
"Yes, Tom, it is a woodpecker," Lily said. "It is very pretty and smart. It can find bugs in the wood."
They watched the woodpecker fly from one tree to another. Then, they saw it land on the roof of their house.
"Hey, woodpecker, don't peck our roof!" Tom shouted. "You will make a hole in it!"
The woodpecker did not listen to Tom. It kept pecking the roof. It liked the sound and the taste of the wood.
"Tom, we have to stop the woodpecker," Lily said. "It will ruin our roof. Let's throw some stones at it."
"No, Lily, that is not nice," Tom said. "The woodpecker is just hungry. Maybe we can give it some food."
Tom and Lily ran inside the house and looked for some food. They found some bread and some nuts. They broke the bread into small pieces and put them in a bowl. They also put some nuts in another bowl.
They took the bowls outside and put them on the ground near the roof. They called the woodpecker.
"Woodpecker, woodpecker, come here!" they said. "We have some food for you. You don't have to peck our roof."
The woodpecker heard them and looked down. It saw the bowls of food. It flew down and landed on the ground. It pecked at the bread and the nuts. It liked them very much.
"Thank you, Tom and Lily," the woodpecker said. "You are very kind and wise. You know how to share and care. I will not peck your roof anymore. I will find another place to settle."
Tom and Lily smiled and waved at the woodpecker. They were happy that they had made a new friend. They watched the woodpecker fly away to a new home.
