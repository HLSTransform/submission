Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she found a delicate vase in her mom's room. She wanted to play with it, but her mom said it was too fragile and she could break it.
Lily didn't listen and took the vase to her room to play. She accidentally dropped it and it broke into many pieces. She felt sad and scared to tell her mom. But then, she remembered something her teacher said in school. She needed to count to ten before doing something she shouldn't.
So, she counted to ten and then went to her mom to tell the truth. Her mom was not angry, but she explained to Lily that sometimes things are delicate and we need to be careful with them. The moral of the story is that it's important to listen to our parents and count before doing something we might regret.
