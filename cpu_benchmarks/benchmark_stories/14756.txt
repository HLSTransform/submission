Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They liked to dig holes and look for bugs. But they did not like to share their toys. Lily had a red shovel and Tom had a blue one. They both wanted to dig the same hole.
"Give me your shovel!" Lily said.
"No, it's mine!" Tom said.
They began to fight. They pulled and pushed each other. They made a lot of noise.
A big rat heard them. It was hiding under a bush. It had sharp teeth and a long tail. It was hungry and stubborn. It wanted to bite them.
The rat ran out of the bush. It squeaked and hissed. It came closer and closer to Lily and Tom.
Lily and Tom saw the rat. They stopped fighting. They were scared. They dropped their shovels and ran away. They ran to their mom.
"Mom, mom, there's a rat!" they cried.
Their mom came to the garden. She saw the rat. She picked up a stick and chased it away. She was brave and strong.
She hugged Lily and Tom. She said, "Don't fight, my darlings. Share your toys and play nicely. And watch out for rats. They are mean and nasty."
Lily and Tom said, "Sorry, mom. We love you. And we don't like rats."
They took their shovels and dug another hole. They found a worm and a beetle. They were happy and friendly. They learned their lesson.
