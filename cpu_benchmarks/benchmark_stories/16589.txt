Sara and Tom were playing with blocks in the living room. They liked to build towers and knock them down. Sara was very good at stacking the blocks high and straight. Tom was not so good. He often made his towers crooked and wobbly.
"Look at my tower, Tom!" Sara said. "It is taller than you!"
Tom looked at Sara's tower and felt angry. He wanted to have a tall tower too. He tried to grab some of Sara's blocks, but she pushed him away.
"Stop it, Tom! These are my blocks!" Sara said. "You have your own blocks!"
Tom did not listen. He reached for Sara's tower again, but this time he knocked it over. The blocks fell on the floor with a loud crash. Sara screamed and started to cry.
"Tom, you are so mean!" Sara said. "You ruined my tower!"
Tom felt bad, but he also felt embarrassed. He did not want Sara to cry. He did not want his mom to hear. He tried to say sorry, but he could not find the words. He ran to the couch and hid behind a pillow. He sucked his thumb and hoped nothing else would happen.
