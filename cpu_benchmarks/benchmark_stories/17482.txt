Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play with their dogs. Tim has a big dog named Rex. Sam has a small dog named Spot. They go to the park with their dogs every day.
One day, they see a new slide at the park. It looks fun. They want to try it. They tie their dogs to a bench with their leashes. They run to the slide. They take turns to slide down.
"Wow, this is so fun!" Tim says.
"Yes, I love it!" Sam says.
They slide and slide and slide. They forget about their dogs.
After a while, they hear a loud bark. They look at the bench. Rex and Spot are gone. The leashes are broken. They see their dogs running after a squirrel.
"Oh no, we lost our dogs!" Tim says.
"Quick, we have to catch them!" Sam says.
They run after their dogs. They call their names. They hope they can find them.
They are not very organized. They should have watched their dogs. They should have used stronger leashes. They should have played with their dogs. They are sorry. They are scared. They are sad. They miss their dogs.
