Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures of animals. One day, she went for a walk in the forest and saw a black bird with shiny feathers. "Look, Mommy! A raven!" she exclaimed. 
As they walked further, they saw a dead rabbit on the ground. "Oh no, poor bunny," said Lily's mommy. "We should bury it." 
Later that day, Lily painted a picture of the raven she saw in the forest. She showed it to her mommy and said, "I hope the raven didn't eat the dead bunny." Her mommy smiled and said, "I don't think so, sweetie. Ravens usually eat nuts and fruits." 
Lily felt happy knowing that the raven wasn't the cause of the bunny's death. She continued to paint more pictures of animals and enjoyed her walks in the forest with her mommy.
