Once upon a time, there was a poor girl. She was very sad. Everywhere she looked she saw people happy, but she was not.
She was so sad that she decided to take a drink from a pond. She did not know that the pond was poisoned. After she drank from the pond, she became sick.
The poor girl was very afraid, but then a kind lady came along. She brought her food and showed her how to relax. She taught her special breathing and stretching exercises.
The girl followed the kind lady's instructions and soon she felt better. She had the energy to get up and she was no longer sad. 
From then on, the poor girl was happy and she learned how to relax so she could stay healthy and safe.
