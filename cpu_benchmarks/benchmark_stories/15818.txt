Once upon a time there was a nice man who always said hello and goodbye to everyone. He was polite and always smiled. One day this nice man was walking in the park and he saw a small boy crying. The man asked the boy why he was so sad. He said he was hungry and did not have any food. The man felt very sorry for the boy and went to his car and got some food out of his bag.
The boy was so happy that he screamed and hugged the man. He thanked him for the food. The man was so glad that he could bring food to the boy and make him happy. They talked and played together until it was time for the man to leave. As he said goodbye to the boy he asked him to always be polite and kind to others. The boy smiled and agreed. They said their goodbyes and the man went on his way. The boy was happy and full of food.
