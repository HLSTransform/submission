Sam and his mom went to the shop. Sam wanted to get some ice cream. Then he saw something unusual near the counter. It was a toy he had never seen before. He asked his mom if he could have it. His mom said that he could if he said please. 
So Sam said please and his mom said yes. She said he could buy the toy. Sam was so happy. He thanked his mom and went to the shop keeper to buy the toy. 
The shop keeper was very friendly and gave Sam an extra candy. He thanked the shop keeper, then went to the ice-cream shop with his mom. They both got some ice cream. It tasted delicious. 
Sam and his mom went back home with his new toy. He was so excited that he could hardly wait to show it to all his friends.
