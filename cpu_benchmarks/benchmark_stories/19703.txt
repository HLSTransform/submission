Once upon a time there was a yellow bear. He liked to go for walks in the park. One day, he was walking when he heard a crack. He looked around and saw a boy holding a stick. The boy shot the stick and the yellow bear was scared. He ran away quickly! 
The yellow bear was sad now because he was too scared to go back to the park. Then one day he saw the same boy in the park. He was playing and shooting the stick, but this time he was not scared. He watched the boy play and enjoyed it! The boy noticed the yellow bear and smiled. Then he showed the yellow bear how to shoot the stick. The yellow bear was happy. He had learned a new game and was no longer scared of the crack.
