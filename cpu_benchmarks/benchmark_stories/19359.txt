Once there was a girl called Sophia who loved playing outside. One day she was playing near a deep river. She wanted to get a closer look, so she stepped onto a strip of land that stretched out over the river. Sophia began to walk, trusting that the strip of land would take her to the other side.
Suddenly, the strip of land sank! Sophia felt scared, but then she saw a boat coming along. It had two big, strong men in it, who offered to help her. Sophia trusted them, and they pulled her onto their boat and brought her safely to the other side.
Sophia was so happy to be safe and sound on the other side. She thanked the two men for their help and for trusting her. She never stepped on the deep strip of land again.
