Ben was a boy who liked to play with his toys. He had many toys, but his favorite was a staff. It was a long stick that he pretended was a magic wand. He liked to wave it and say spells.
One day, he found a book in his dad's room. It had pictures of wizards and dragons and castles. He was eager to read it, but the words were too hard. He saw a spell that said "become a wizard". He thought it would be fun to try it.
He took his staff and the book to the backyard. He read the spell out loud and waved his staff. He felt a tingling in his body. He looked at his hands and saw they were hairy and clawed. He looked at his feet and saw they were hooves. He looked at his face and saw he had a long nose and horns. He had become a goat!
He tried to undo the spell, but he could not read the book anymore. He could only make goat noises. He was scared and sad. He ran to the house, but his mom and dad did not recognize him. They thought he was a stray goat and chased him away. He had to live in the woods with other goats. He missed his toys and his family. He wished he had never played with the staff and the book.
The moral of the story is: do not play with things you do not understand. They might be dangerous or have bad consequences. Be happy with what you have and do not try to be something you are not.
