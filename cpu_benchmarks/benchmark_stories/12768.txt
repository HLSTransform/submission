Once upon a time there was a soldier. He had a long journey to make, so he set out to travel a long way. On his way, he came across a tricky problem that he could not solve. 
Feeling frustrated, he shouted out: "Who can help me solve this problem?"
Just then, a small 3 year old child appeared out of nowhere. He was kind and wise. The child said: "I can help. Let's work together and solve it."
The soldier and the child worked together for a long time until they solved the tricky problem. The soldier was very happy and said: "Thank you for helping me, little one. Everyone needs a friend to help them along life's journey."
The story ends with the moral that when we work together, we can solve any problem.
