Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Red. She lived in a small village near a big forest. One day, her mother asked her to take some cookies to her grandma who lived in the forest. Red put on her red coat and went on her way.
As she was walking, she saw a big, scary wolf. The wolf had icy eyes and sharp teeth. Red was scared, but she tried to resist the urge to run away. She remembered her mother's words and stayed still.
The wolf came closer and closer, but then suddenly, a group of friendly animals appeared. They chased the wolf away and Red was safe. She thanked the animals and continued on her way to her grandma's house. From that day on, Red knew that she could resist her fears and always find help when she needed it.
