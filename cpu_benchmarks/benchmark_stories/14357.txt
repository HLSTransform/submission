Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys every day. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a big box to play with. Timmy was happy and curious to see what was inside.
When Timmy opened the box, he found a lot of colorful squares. Timmy started to play with the squares and he made a big square tower. Timmy was very proud of his tower and he laughed happily.
Suddenly, Timmy's little sister came and she wanted to play with the squares too. Timmy didn't want to share his squares, but his mom told him to be flexible and share with his sister. Timmy listened to his mom and shared his squares with his sister. They both laughed and played together happily.
