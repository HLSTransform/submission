Once, there was a family who wanted to have an adventure. So, the parents decided to invite everyone to go to the beach in the summer. The beach was unknown to them â€“ they had never been before! 
The kids were so excited and ran around, asking all the questions they could think of.
"What kind of animals will we see?" asked one of the children.
"What games will we play?" asked another. 
The parents smiled and explained that it was a surprise. They all packed their bags and set off on their journey.
When they arrived, the kids couldn't believe what they saw! The beach was beautiful, with soft sand and warm water, and lots of animals running around. Everyone cheered in delight and ran to put their feet into the ocean.
It was the best summer ever. Even though the beach was unknown at first, it quickly became a home away from home.
