Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play outside. But today the weather is bad. It is cold and wet. They cannot go to the park or ride their bikes.
"Let's play inside," Anna says. "We can make signs for our rooms."
"OK," Ben says. "That sounds fun. What kind of signs do you want to make?"
Anna thinks for a moment. She likes modern things. She likes bright colors and shapes. She says, "I want to make a sign with a star and a heart. And I want to write my name in big letters. What about you?"
Ben likes modern things too. But he likes different colors and shapes. He says, "I want to make a sign with a circle and a square. And I want to write my name in small letters. Let's go get some paper and crayons."
They go to Anna's room. They find some paper and crayons. They start to make their signs. They draw and color. They write their names. They are happy. They show each other their signs.
"Wow, your sign is very modern," Anna says. "I like your circle and square. They look cool."
"Thank you," Ben says. "Your sign is very modern too. I like your star and heart. They look pretty."
They smile at each other. They are proud of their signs. They hang them on their doors. They say, "These are our rooms. These are our signs. We are modern friends."
