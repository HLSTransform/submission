Once upon a time, there was a beautiful plane. It had shiny red and blue wings. The plane was going to measure something special. So the plane flew up high, up into the sky. It flew all the way to the clouds.
The plane flew around and around, measuring the sky. When the plane was finished, it flew back down to the ground. The plane did a happy dance when it finished measuring. It was so proud of itself that it made a big smile. 
The plane was so happy that it flew around and around. It wiggled and twirled in the sky. The plane was so beautiful, everyone stopped to watch it. It was so special that everybody waved and smiled.
The plane was so happy it had measured something so important. It was so proud of itself that it flew up into the sky. It flew up to the clouds and kept flying and flying. The plane flew around and around, and waves goodbye to everyone it had seen. 
The End.
