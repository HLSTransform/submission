Once upon a time, there was a cute little kitten named Mittens. Mittens had a soft, fluffy paw that she loved to show off to her friends. One day, Mittens was playing with her friend, a little mouse named Squeaky. They were having so much fun chasing each other around the garden.
Suddenly, Mittens stopped and looked at Squeaky with a serious face. "Do you hear that?" she asked. Squeaky listened carefully and heard a loud noise coming from the bushes. "What could it be?" Squeaky asked.
Mittens slowly walked towards the bushes and then suddenly jumped back. "It's a big, scary dog!" she cried. "We need to lay low and be very quiet until it goes away." Squeaky nodded and they both hid behind a nearby flower pot.
After a few minutes, the dog walked away and Mittens and Squeaky were safe. "Phew, that was not a normal day," Mittens said, as they continued to play together. From that day on, they always made sure to be careful and keep an eye out for any danger.
