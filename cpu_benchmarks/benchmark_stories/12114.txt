Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play on the swing at the park. One day, she saw a boy swinging next to her. "Hi, my name is Jack," said the boy. "Do you want to swing with me?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, please!"
As they swung higher and higher, Lily looked up at the world above them. "The world is so big," she said. Jack nodded and said, "But we can go anywhere we want if we try hard enough." Lily felt nervous about going to new places, but Jack's words made her feel better.
After a while, they got off the swings and sat on a bench. "Thanks for swinging with me," said Lily. "You're welcome," said Jack. "Maybe we can explore the world together someday." Lily smiled and said, "That sounds like fun!" And from then on, they were swing buddies and best friends forever.
