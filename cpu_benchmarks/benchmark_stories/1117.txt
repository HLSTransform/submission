Thomas was a young boy who loved to go outside and play. One day he was out in the park and he saw a long slide. He was so excited that he ran right over to it. He loved to slide down and it felt so fun.
After a few slides, Thomas noticed some other children playing near the slide too. One of them had a big toy car. Thomas walked over for a closer look, but the other kid did not want to share it. They started to fight and Thomas was sad.
Thomas's mom saw what was happening and quickly came over to him. She said that it was not nice to fight and took Thomas away from the slide. They went home and Thomas thought about what had happened for a long time.
In the end, Thomas learned that fighting was not the answer to his problems, and he decided to try and find other ways to solve them. He thought long and hard and finally realised that it was better to talk things out and be kind. And of course he still loves to go out and slide too.
