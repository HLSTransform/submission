Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect pebbles. One day, she found a very special pebble that was famous in her town. She was so happy and wanted to show it to her friend Jack.
"Lily, what did you find?" asked Jack.
"I found a famous pebble! Do you want to see it?" said Lily.
"Sure, can I hold it?" asked Jack.
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Yes, I will allow you to hold it, but please be careful with it."
Jack held the famous pebble and admired it. "Wow, this is really cool!" he said.
Lily smiled and said, "I know, right? I'm so lucky to have found it."
From that day on, Lily and Jack played with the famous pebble together and had many adventures. They were happy to have each other as friends and to have found such a special treasure.
