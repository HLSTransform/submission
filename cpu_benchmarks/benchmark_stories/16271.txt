Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She was out for a walk with her mom. As they walked, Sue noticed something funny in the field: a cow. Sue thought it was very funny. She asked her mom, "Mom, why is that cow so funny?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Let's go find out!" And so they went to the field. When they got there, Sue noticed that the cow was wearing a hat! She couldn't believe it, and she laughed and laughed.
The cow noticed Sue and said, "Hello there Sue! I think you look funny too. Would you like to help me find my way home?" Sue nodded her head yes and they began to walk down the path. They laughed and talked the whole time.
When they reached the cow's barn, the cow thanked Sue for helping it find its way home. Before the cow left, it noticed something funny about Sue: she was wearing the same hat as it! the cow laughed and said, "Well isn't that funny!"
Sue smiled and said, "Yes, it is funny!" Her mom smiled too and said, "Sue, I think you can have this hat!" From that day forward, Sue and the cow were best friends.
