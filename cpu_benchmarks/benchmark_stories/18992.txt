Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the zoo with his mom and dad. One day, Timmy saw a penguin in the zoo. The penguin was so cute and fluffy!
Timmy asked his mom if he could touch the penguin. His mom said, "Sure, but be gentle and don't squeeze too hard." Timmy gently touched the penguin's feathers and giggled.
Suddenly, the penguin started acting crazy and flapping its wings. Timmy's mom said, "I think the penguin wants to go for a swim." Timmy waved goodbye to the penguin and said, "Bye-bye, crazy penguin!"
