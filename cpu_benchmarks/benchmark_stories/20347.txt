One day, a boy and a girl went to the shore with their mom. They liked to play in the sand and the water. They made a big castle with shells and sticks. They were very happy.
But then, a big wave came and washed away their castle. The boy and the girl were sad. They cried and cried. Their mom said, "Don't cry, my loves. We can make another castle. But first, we have to walk and find a new spot. The shore is very messy now. There is trash and seaweed everywhere. We have to be careful and not step on them."
The boy and the girl nodded. They wiped their tears and held their mom's hand. They walked along the shore and looked for a clean spot. They saw other people who were picking up the trash and putting it in bags. They asked their mom, "Why are they doing that?"
Their mom said, "They are doing that because they care about the shore and the sea. They want to keep it beautiful and healthy. The trash can hurt the fish and the birds and the plants. It can also hurt us if we touch it. We should help them, too. Do you want to help them?"
The boy and the girl said, "Yes, we want to help them!" They found some bags and gloves and started to pick up the trash. They worked hard and had fun. They made new friends with the other people. They also found a new spot for their castle. It was clean and sunny and safe. They made a new castle with shells and sticks. They were very happy.
Their mom said, "I'm proud of you, my loves. You learned a good lesson today. You learned that sometimes things can go wrong, but we can always try again. You also learned that we have to respect and protect the shore and the sea. They are our friends and our home. You did a good thing today. You made the shore a better place."
The boy and the girl hugged their mom. They said, "Thank you, mom. We love you. We love the shore and the sea, too. We will always take care of them." They smiled and played until the sun went down. They had a wonderful day.
