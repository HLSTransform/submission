Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very tired because he didn't sleep well last night. He wanted to go to bed early tonight so he could sleep better. 
But when Timmy went to his room, he saw a spider on his bed! He was scared of spiders and didn't want to sleep with it. So he asked his mommy to help him get rid of the spider. 
His mommy came and caught the spider with a cup. Timmy was very happy and thanked his mommy. He went to bed and slept soundly. He dreamt of fun things, not boring things like spiders. The end.
