Tom and Amy are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a big box of bricks. They can make many things with bricks.
One day, they decide to make a house with bricks. They find a good spot under a tree. They start to put bricks on top of each other. They make walls and a door and a window. They are very happy.
"Look at our house!" Tom says. "It is so big and strong!"
"Yes, it is!" Amy says. "And it is light inside. See, the sun comes through the window!"
They go inside their house. They sit on the floor. They smile at each other. They feel cozy and safe.
But then, they hear a loud noise. It is a dog. The dog is big and black. He sees the house. He thinks it is a toy. He runs to the house. He barks and jumps. He knocks down the bricks.
Tom and Amy are scared. They run out of the house. They see their bricks falling down. They feel sad and angry.
"Bad dog!" Tom shouts. "Go away! You broke our house!"
The dog does not listen. He keeps playing with the bricks. He thinks it is fun.
Tom and Amy do not know what to do. They look for help. They see a man. The man is the dog's owner. He is walking in the park. He sees the dog and the bricks. He sees Tom and Amy.
"Hey, stop that!" the man says. "That is not your toy! That is their house!"
He runs to the dog. He grabs his collar. He pulls him away from the bricks. He says sorry to Tom and Amy.
"I'm sorry, kids," he says. "My dog is naughty. He did not mean to hurt your house. He just wanted to play."
Tom and Amy are still sad. They look at their broken house. They do not want to play anymore.
The man feels bad. He wants to make them happy. He has an idea.
"Hey, why don't you come with me?" he says. "I have more bricks at home. You can make a new house there. And my dog will not bother you. He will stay in his cage."
Tom and Amy think about it. They like the idea. They want to make a new house. They want to play with more bricks.
"Okay," they say. "Thank you, mister."
They follow the man. They leave the park. They go to his car. They see the dog in the back seat. He looks sorry. He wags his tail.
Tom and Amy smile. They forgive the dog. They hope he will be good. They are excited to make a new house. They are still friends.
