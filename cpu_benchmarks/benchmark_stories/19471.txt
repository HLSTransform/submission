Once there was a very famous dog named Phil. He was so famous that everyone wanted to lend him things. One day, Phil received a letter in the mail. It said that he had an exam coming up and he was so scared.
Phil asked his friends to lend him a pencil so he could do his exam. His friends were so kind that they all lent Phil pencils. Phil thanked them and said he would try his best.
On the day of the exam, Phil put on his best vest and worked really hard. He used the pencils that his friends had lent him to complete his exam. In the end, Phil did really well. He was so proud and thanked his friends for lending him the pencils.
