Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very eager to go on a trip with her mommy and daddy. They packed their bags and got into the car. Lily was so excited that she couldn't nap in the car.
After a while, they arrived at the beach. Lily saw the sand and the waves and she ran towards them. "Can we swim now?" she asked her parents. "Not yet," they said. "First, we need to take a nap in our beach tent."
Lily was a bit disappointed, but she lay down in the tent and closed her eyes. Soon, she fell asleep and had a dream about swimming in the ocean. When she woke up, she was refreshed and ready for their beach trip.
