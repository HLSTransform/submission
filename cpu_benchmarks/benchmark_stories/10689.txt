Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to help his mom in the kitchen. One day, his mom asked him to stir the soup on the stove. Timmy was very careful and stirred the soup slowly.
Later that day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her organize his closet. Timmy didn't like cleaning, but he wanted to help his mom. So, he took all his shirts out of the closet and put them in a pile on the floor.
As Timmy and his mom were finishing up, Timmy noticed something strange. One of his shirts was missing! He looked everywhere, but he couldn't find it. Suddenly, he remembered that he had accidentally stirred the soup with his shirt sleeve earlier that day. He ran to the kitchen and found his shirt soaking in the soup.
From that day forward, Timmy made sure to wear an apron when he helped his mom in the kitchen. And he also learned to be more careful when he stirred the soup.
