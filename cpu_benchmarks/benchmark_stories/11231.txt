Once, there was a girl named Lily. Everyone thought Lily was very intelligent. She had long, curly hair that she liked to mark with colourful bows.
Lily and her friend, Mike, were playing in the park one day. While they were playing tag, Mike saw something shiny in the grass. He went to pick it up.
"What did you find, Mike?" asked Lily.
"It's a marker!" shouted Mike, proudly holding it up in the air.
"I love markers," said Lily. "Let's paint our hair!"
Mike and Lily laughed at the idea. They each used the marker to draw a big, colourful bow in their hair.
Afterwards, Mike and Lily went back to their game of tag. From then on, Lily was known for her intelligent and creative style.
