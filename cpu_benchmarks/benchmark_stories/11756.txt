Once upon a time, there was a group of powerful friends. These friends would always pray together. Every time they prayed, their friendship would become even stronger. They enjoyed being together and were always grateful for each other and their many blessings.
One day, they heard that another group of people were in need of help. So the powerful friends decided to go and help them. They went to the other group and shared with them the power of prayer. Then they all prayed together for a better future.
As time went on, the powerful friends kept on praying together, and their friendship kept on growing stronger. They always remembered to be thankful for all of their blessings, and to lend a helping hand to others in need.
The powerful friends realise that when they pray together, they can help to make the world a better place. So they will keep on praying and helping others in need, so that they all can continue to feel the power of prayer.
