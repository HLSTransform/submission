Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved space. He had a big toy rocket ship that he played with every day. But one day, the rocket ship broke and Timmy was sad.
Timmy's mom asked him what was wrong, and he told her that his rocket ship was broken. She said, "Don't worry, we can repair it together!" Timmy was happy to hear that.
So, they got some glue and fixed the rocket ship. Timmy was so happy that he wanted to show it to his friend Billy. But when they got to Billy's house, Billy said that he didn't like space toys anymore. Timmy was sad again because he thought his rocket ship wasn't popular anymore.
But then, Billy said, "Actually, I still like space toys. Can I play with your rocket ship?" Timmy was happy again and they played together. They even pretended to be astronauts on a mission to explore the galaxy. Timmy was so happy that his repaired rocket ship was popular again.
