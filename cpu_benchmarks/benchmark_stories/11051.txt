Tom and Lily were playing in their room. They had many toys and books and crayons. They liked to make pictures and stories with them. But they did not like to share.
Tom saw a big book with many animals. He wanted to look at it. But Lily had it first. She said, "This is mine. You can have the other book."
Tom was angry. He said, "No, I want this book. Give it to me." He tried to take it from Lily.
Lily was angry too. She said, "No, this is mine. You can have the scissors." She pushed Tom away.
Tom did not want the scissors. He wanted the book. He shouted, "Give me the book. Give me the book now."
Lily shouted back, "No, no, no. Go away. Go away now."
Their mom heard them shouting. She came to their room. She saw them fighting over the book. She saw the scissors on the floor. She was scared. She said, "Stop, stop, stop. What are you doing? You could hurt each other with the scissors. You have to share and be nice."
Tom and Lily stopped shouting. They looked at their mom. They looked at the book. They looked at the scissors. They felt sorry. They said, "We are sorry, mom. We were not nice. We will share and be nice."
Their mom smiled. She said, "That's good. I'm glad you are sorry. Now, why don't you look at the book together? You can learn about the animals. And you can use the scissors to cut out some shapes. But be careful. And ask me if you need help."
Tom and Lily nodded. They said, "Okay, mom. Thank you, mom." They hugged their mom. Then they looked at the book together. They learned about the animals. They used the scissors to cut out some shapes. They were careful. They asked their mom if they needed help. They had fun. They were happy. They were nice.
