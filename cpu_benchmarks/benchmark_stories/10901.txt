Once upon a time, there was a little car named Red. Red loved to drive fast and have fun. But one day, Red ran out of fuel and had to stop. Red was sad and didn't know what to do.
Then, Red saw a big truck with lots of fuel. Red wanted to take some fuel from the truck, but that would not behave well. Red decided to wait for help.
But it was getting dark and Red was getting pale. Suddenly, a scary monster appeared and scared Red. Red tried to run away, but the monster caught Red and took Red away. 
Red never came back and was never seen again. The end.
