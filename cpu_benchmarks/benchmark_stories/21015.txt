Once there was a wide bathtub. Every day, a big boy would get in the bathtub and splash around. But one day, something special happened. The boy jumped in the bathtub and he started to shrink! He shrank down smaller and smaller until he was as small as a bug.
He looked around him and noticed the wide bathtub was now much bigger than before. He couldn't believe it! He had shrunk down so tiny! The boy wasn't scared though. He splashed around the bathtub, exploring his new mini world.
The boy had so much fun playing and jumping in the bathtub. But then came the time to get out. He tried to climb up the side, but it was too slippery. He started to panic and didn't know what to do.
But then, he noticed something strange. As he looked around, he realized that he was slowly getting bigger again. And soon he was the same size as before. He couldn't believe it! His shrinking adventure was over and he had grown back to normal.
He jumped out of the wide bathtub, ready to play again.
