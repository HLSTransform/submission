Once upon a time, there was a fireman. He was tall and strong. He wore a tight red suit and a big hat.
One day, the fireman was sitting in his car. He was waiting for an emergency call. When he saw smoke in the sky, he knew he had to help.
The fireman drove quickly to the house that was on fire. He jumped out of his car and grabbed his hose. He started to put out the fire.
When all of the flames were gone, the fireman sat down on the ground. He was very tired but happy he had saved the house! Everyone thanked the brave fireman for his hard work. 
The fireman smiled. He knew he had done a good job. He drove away, feeling very proud.
