Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in the bathtub. He would splash and laugh and have so much fun. 
One day, Timmy's mom told him it was time to get out of the bathtub. Timmy didn't want to get out yet, so he tried to hide under the bubbles. But his mom found him and said, "Timmy, you can't rot in the bathtub all day!" 
Timmy thought his mom was being stupid. He didn't want to get out of the bathtub. But he knew he had to listen to his mom, so he got out and dried off. Even though he was sad to leave the bathtub, he knew he could always come back and play again later.
