Annie was walking around the park with her mom. She looked up at the sky and saw some fluffy white clouds. Suddenly, she stumbled and almost fell down. But her mom was there to help her. "Are you okay, Annie?" asked mom. Annie smiled and nodded.
She looked down and saw a shiny coin on the ground. "Look, a coin!" said Annie. Mom smiled and bent down to pick it up for her. Annie smiled and hugged it tight. 
Mom promised to take her to get an ice cream cone after they left the park. Annie was so excited and asked, "What kind will it be?" Mom said it would be a yummy chocolate cone. Annie giggled and said, "Yay! Ice cream!" 
Annie and mom enjoyed the rest of their day at the park. She skipped, ran and laughed all around. And when they were done, they got two yummy ice cream cones to enjoy on the car ride home.
