Once upon a time there was a little boy. He wanted to go swimming but he didn't have a pool! So the little boy looked up at the roof. He was so brave! He wanted to see if he could climb to the top.
The roof was hard and it was very high. But the little boy was determined to climb it. He kept going until he was at the very top.
When the little boy reached the top of the roof, he was so excited. He smiled and jumped into the water. He was swimming! It felt so good to be swimming in the sky!
The little boy enjoyed swimming up in the sky so much he stayed up there. He swam and played all day until the sun went down. He swam back down and went home with a smile on his face.
The little boy was so proud of himself! He knew he could do anything he put his mind to.
