Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside. One day, he saw a new path in the woods. He wanted to see where it went. But his mom told him, "Tim, don't go on that path. It is not safe."
But Tim did not listen. He did not want to ignore the path. He walked on it. Soon, he saw a big, harmless bug. The bug was sad. It told Tim, "I am lost. Can you help me find my home?"
Tim wanted to help the bug. But he was scared. He did not know where the bug's home was. He did not want to get lost too. He thought, "What if I can't find my way back home?"
Tim was brave. He said, "I will help you, bug. We will find your home together." They walked and walked. At last, they found the bug's home. The bug was happy. Tim was happy too. He had made a new friend. And he learned that sometimes, it is okay to not ignore things, even if they seem scary at first.
