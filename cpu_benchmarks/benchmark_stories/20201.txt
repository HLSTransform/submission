Lily and Tom were hungry. They wanted to eat some oats with milk and honey. They went to the kitchen and saw a big jar of oats on the shelf. Lily tried to reach the jar, but it was too high. She asked Tom to help her.
"Tom, can you get the jar for me?" Lily said.
"OK, Lily. I will try." Tom said.
Tom climbed on a chair and stretched his arm. He touched the jar, but it was heavy. He pulled the jar, but it slipped from his hand. The jar fell down and broke on the floor. The oats spilled everywhere.
"Oh no! What have we done?" Lily said.
"Shh! Don't make noise. Mom will be angry." Tom said.
They heard footsteps coming to the kitchen. It was Mom. She saw the mess and frowned.
"Who did this?" Mom asked.
Lily and Tom looked at each other. They were scared. They did not want to get in trouble.
"It was not me. It was Tom." Lily said.
"No, it was not me. It was Lily." Tom said.
They started to argue and blame each other. They did not say sorry. They did not tell the truth.
Mom was not happy. She did not like lies. She did not like fights. She slapped both of them on the hand.
"Ow! That hurts!" Lily said.
"Ow! That hurts!" Tom said.
Mom said, "That is for lying and fighting. You should not do that. It is dangerous. You could have hurt yourself or each other. You should be careful and kind. You should say sorry and help me clean up."
Lily and Tom felt bad. They knew Mom was right. They said sorry to Mom and to each other. They helped Mom sweep the oats and throw away the broken jar. They hugged Mom and said they loved her.
Mom smiled and said, "I love you too. Next time, ask me for help if you want something. I will make you some oats with milk and honey. But first, wash your hands."
