Once upon a time there was a famous cushion. It was very special because it was loved by everyone.
Every day the cushion got lots of hugs and cuddles. This made it feel very happy and cosy. All the little children in the neighbourhood would play with the cushion and love it like a friend.
On sunny days the cushion would go for walks in the park and it would meet lots of new friends. Everywhere it went it was praised for being so famous. The cushion felt so loved. 
At the end of a long day the cushion would come home and curl up on the sofa. After all its adventures, the cushion was tired, but it was content because its day was filled with lots of love.
