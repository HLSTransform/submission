Once upon a time, there was a poor girl named Jane. She wanted to make a dress, but she didn't have a needle to sew it with. 
One day, Jane looked out her window and saw a needle on the ground. She ran to grab it, but it was stuck in a branch just out of reach. 
So Jane tried to climb the tree, but it was too tall for her. She started to cry.
Suddenly, a friendly voice came from behind. It was the old woman who lived next door. She said to Jane, "Don't worry, I can help you get the needle. What do you need?" 
Jane said, "I need a stick so I can reach the needle". 
The old woman smiled and gave Jane a long stick. Jane reached up with the stick and was able to grab the needle. 
Jane was so happy. She thanked the old woman and ran home with the needle. She was able to make her dress, and she lived happily ever after.
