Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the zoo and seeing all the animals. One day, she went to see the gorillas. She saw a big, adorable gorilla and said, "Hi, Mr. Gorilla! You look so cute!" 
The gorilla looked at Lily and smiled. "Thank you, little girl. What's your name?" he asked. 
"My name is Lily. What's your name?" she asked back. 
"My name is George," said the gorilla. "I like it when kids come to visit me. It makes me happy." 
Lily spent the whole day with George, playing and laughing with him. As the day started to end, Lily said goodbye to George and promised to come back and visit him again. From that day on, Lily visited George every week and they became the best of friends.
