Once there was a little girl who was walking with her mom. They went to the market and the little girl saw something really weird. It was bright pink and had a strange shape. She asked her mom what it was, and her mom said it was a watermelon. The little girl had never seen one before, so she was very surprised.
Then she saw something even more weird. It was big and colorful and full of things. Her mom said it was called a market. The little girl was very curious and she wanted to explore it. She walked around and looked at all the things that were being sold. She saw fruits, vegetables and lots of other things.
Finally, she recognized something special. It was a cupcake with sprinkles. She really liked it and knew she had seen it before. She asked her mom for it and her mom said yes. The little girl was so happy! She remembered it from her birthday party the week before. She was proud of herself for recognizing it. She had a great time at the market and would remember it for a long time.
