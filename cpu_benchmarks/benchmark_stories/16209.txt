Once upon a time there was a man walking down the street. He was carrying something fragile in his hands. He forgot to look around, and he didn't see the police behind him!
The police shouted, “Hey! Stop!”
The man was so scared he dropped the fragile thing in his hands. Then he ran as fast as he could.
But he was too slow and the police caught up with him.
They took him away to jail. He forgot the fragile thing on the street and he never saw it again.
The End.
