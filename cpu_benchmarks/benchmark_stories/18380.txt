One day, a little orange dove was in the park. It saw a big tree and wanted to sit on it. The orange dove flew up and sat on a branch. It was very happy.
A little boy came to the park. He saw the orange dove and wanted to play with it. He asked, "Dove, will you come down and play with me?" But the orange dove did not want to play. It refused to come down.
The little boy was sad. He sat under the tree and looked at the orange dove. The dove saw the boy was sad and felt bad. It flew down and sat next to the boy. They became friends and played in the park every day.
