One day, a little girl named Lily wanted to reach for a pretty sheet of paper. The sheet was very attractive with many colors on it. It was on a high shelf in her room, and she was too small to get it by herself.
Lily asked her big brother, Tom, for help. But Tom was busy playing with his toy cars and did not want to stop. This made Lily feel sad and upset. She really wanted that attractive sheet to draw a picture for her mommy.
Lily got an idea. She found her favorite toy, a big stuffed bear, and put it on the floor. She stood on the bear to make herself taller. Now she could reach the attractive sheet! Lily was so happy and proud of herself. She drew a beautiful picture and showed it to Tom. Tom felt sorry for not helping her, and they both played together, drawing more pictures on the attractive sheets.
