Sara and Ben liked to play music. They had a drum, a flute, and a bell. They made a lot of noise with their music. They did not care if they bothered anyone.
One day, they went to the park with their music. They saw a man sitting on a bench. He was reading a book. He looked very quiet and calm.
"Let's play music for him!" Sara said. "Maybe he will like it!"
Ben nodded. They ran to the bench and started to bang, blow, and ring their music. They did not have a good rhythm. They did not ask the man if he wanted to hear their music. They were not polite.
The man frowned. He put his book down. He looked at Sara and Ben with angry eyes.
"Stop it! Stop it now!" he shouted. "You are very rude and noisy! You are hurting my ears and my head! Go away!"
Sara and Ben were scared. They dropped their music and ran away. They felt very bad. They regretted playing music for the man. They wished they had been more polite and respectful.
The moral of the story is: Always ask before you play music for someone. Not everyone likes the same kind of music. Be polite and considerate of others.
