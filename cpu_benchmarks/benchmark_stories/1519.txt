Jim was walking in the park one day when he spotted something furry by a tree. He went over to examine it closer. It was an attractive, brown squirrel. Jim was fascinated. He had never seen one so close up before.
Jim watched as the little squirrel twitched its nose before scurrying up the tree with its furry tail behind. Jim smiled and went on his way.
The next day, Jim decided to return to the park and search for the squirrel. Sure enough, it was right by the same tree, nibbling on a nut. Jim carefully watched as it examined the nut for what seemed like a long time.
Jim was amazed. He had never seen anyone take the time to examine such a small thing before. He was so enchanted with the squirrel that he decided to visit it every day.
