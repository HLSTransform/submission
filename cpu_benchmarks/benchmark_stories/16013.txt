Once upon a time there was a yellow pill. One day, a little girl wanted to find out what it was. She asked her mom and her mom told her it was medicine. The little girl asked, "What will the pill do?" Her mom said, "It's to make you feel better".
The little girl wasn't sure if she wanted to take the yellow pill, so her mom told her it would make her feel much better. The little girl was still unsure. Her mom said, "I'll tell you what, if you take the yellow pill, I'll give you a nice present".
The little girl thought of the present and felt happy. She took the yellow pill, and soon she felt better. Her mom gave her the present, and the little girl was so excited.
The end.
