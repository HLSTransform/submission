Once there was a wise owl. He lived in a tall tree. One day he was feeling grumpy and he wanted to do something fun. So he decided to build a stack. But it didn't turn out the way he planned. 
The stack just kept getting higher and higher. Soon it was the highest stack ever made! The wise owl was so excited that he started to yell out loud. Everyone in the forest heard him and came to see the tall stack. 
The animals all cheered and clapped for the wise owl. They couldn't believe how big the stack was. They all thanked the wise owl for making such a fun stack. 
From then on, the wise owl would build a stack whenever he felt grumpy. It always cheered him up and made him happy. He became the most famous owl in the forest!
