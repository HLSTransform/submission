One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. He walked down the street and saw a big square. The square was hard and made of stone. Tim thought it was fun to walk on the hard square.
As Tim walked, he saw a little girl named Sue. Sue was also walking on the hard square. Tim said, "Hi Sue! Do you like to walk on the hard square too?" Sue smiled and said, "Yes, Tim! It's fun to walk here!"
Tim and Sue walked together on the hard square. They laughed and played. They had a great day walking and playing on the hard square. They became good friends and walked together every day.
