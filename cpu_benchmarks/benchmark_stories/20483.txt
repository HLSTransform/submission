Once there was an elderly folder. Every day, he had a big fight with his friend. It was like a game. They used to yell and scream and play fight. The folder was always so much fun.
One day, a little 3-year-old boy saw them fighting. He smiled and wanted to join. So he ran over and joined in with them. His laughter was so loud, it could be heard miles away. 
The elderly folder was so happy. He loved having a young friend to play with. So he always told the little boy to come back whenever he wanted to play. 
The little boy was so excited. Every day he would go to play with the elderly folder and they would have a huge fight. Then they would laugh and hug. 
The elderly folder was so thankful to the little boy for bringing laughter and joy to his life. He taught the little boy about life and what it was like to be elderly. The little boy was so lucky to have an elderly friend to play with!
