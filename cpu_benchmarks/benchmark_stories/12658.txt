Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park, and she especially loved to watch the squirrels. One day, as she was playing, she spotted a squirrel gathering nuts. She thought it was so cute!
The next day, Lily brought some nuts with her to the park. She wanted to give them to the squirrel she had seen the day before. She waited and waited, but the squirrel didn't come. 
But then, as she was about to leave, she heard a rustling in the bushes. She recognized the sound right away - it was the squirrel! Lily was so happy to see him. She gave him the nuts and he ate them right up. 
From then on, Lily always brought nuts with her to the park. She knew they were useful for the squirrels and she loved to watch them eat. And every time she heard a rustling in the bushes, she recognized it as her little squirrel friend.
