Once there was a dog named Sam. Sam really loved to spend his days outside, running around and playing. One day, Sam was running around when he discovered an interesting bone sitting in the grass. The bone was flexible, so Sam decided to spend some time playing with it.
He rolled the bone around on the ground, and tried to chew on it. The bone was too flexible for him to bite, so he kept rolling it around instead. Soon he was so busy rolling the bone that he didn't even notice the sun setting.
When it got dark, Sam headed back home for the night. He was so happy that he had spent the day playing with his flexible bone. He couldn't wait to spend the next day enjoying his new toy again.
