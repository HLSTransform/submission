Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved ice-cream very much. Every day, he would ask his mommy for ice-cream. One day, his mommy said no. Timmy was sad and he sighed.
"Why can't I have ice-cream, mommy?" Timmy asked.
"Because you didn't eat your vegetables, Timmy. Eating vegetables is difficult but it's good for you," mommy replied.
Timmy thought about what mommy said and decided to eat his vegetables. The next day, mommy gave him ice-cream as a reward for eating his vegetables. Timmy was very happy and he learned that sometimes doing difficult things can lead to good things.
