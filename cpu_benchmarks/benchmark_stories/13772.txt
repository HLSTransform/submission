Tom and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to look for bugs and flowers. They saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was brown and round and had white spots.
"Look, a mushroom!" Tom said. "Can we pick it?"
"No, we can't," Lily said. "Mushrooms are not for picking. They are for bugs and fairies. Maybe there is a fairy house inside."
They went closer to the mushroom and saw a tiny door and a window. They knocked on the door, but no one answered.
"Maybe the fairy is sleepy," Tom said. "Let's leave a gift for her."
They looked around and found some berries and nuts. They put them in a leaf and made a basket. They also found a feather and a flower. They tied them with a grass and made a wand.
"Here, fairy, this is for you," Lily said. She put the basket and the wand next to the mushroom. "We hope you like it."
They heard a soft voice from inside the mushroom. "Thank you, children. You are very kind. I was taking a nap, but now I am awake. I will load your basket with magic and your wand with wishes. Come back tomorrow and see what I have done."
Tom and Lily were very happy. They said goodbye to the fairy and ran back to their house. They could not wait to see the magic and the wishes. They had a lot of fun playing in the garden.
