Once upon a time there was a boy named Sam. He was very excited to go swiming. He had been waiting all day to go!
Sam's dad took him to the big pool to go swimming. He was so happy! He put on his Swim gear and was ready to go.
When they got to the pool, Sam wanted to dive right in but his dad said to wait until all of the people had parted. Sam was very impatient, but he waited.
When the people had parted and left the pool, Sam and his dad jumped in together and started to swim. Sam was so happy, he was laughing and splashing in the pool! 
They splashed and swam for hours, until Sam and his dad were both very tired. They watched the sun go down and decided it was time to go home. Sam was very sad to leave, but he knew he could come back again the next day.
