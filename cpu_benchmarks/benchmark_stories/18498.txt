Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with toys. They have many toys in their room. But they are not organized. They leave their toys everywhere. Mom is not happy.
One day, Mom says, "Anna and Ben, you need to clean your room. It is too messy. If you clean your room, you will receive a surprise."
Anna and Ben want a surprise. They think it is a new toy. They start to clean their room. They put their toys in boxes and shelves. They work hard.
But they have a problem. They both want the same toy. It is a big yellow bus. They like to make noises with the bus. They like to drive the bus around the room. They both say, "This is my bus. I want to play with it."
They start to fight. They pull the bus. They push each other. They yell. Mom hears them. She comes to their room. She sees the mess. She sees the bus. She is not happy.
She says, "Anna and Ben, stop fighting. You are not organized. You did not clean your room. You did not listen to me. You will not receive a surprise. You will go to bed early."
Anna and Ben are sad. They say, "Sorry, Mom. We are sorry. We will share the bus. We will clean our room. We will be organized. Please, can we have a surprise?"
Mom thinks. She says, "OK. I will give you one more chance. But you have to finish cleaning your room. And you have to be nice to each other. And you have to wait until tomorrow for the surprise."
Anna and Ben agree. They hug Mom. They hug each other. They finish cleaning their room. They put the bus on the shelf. They say, "Thank you, Mom. We love you. We wonder what the surprise is."
Mom smiles. She says, "You will see tomorrow. Good night, Anna and Ben. Sleep well."
She turns off the light. She leaves the room. Anna and Ben go to bed. They dream of the surprise. They hope it is a new toy. They hope it is a big yellow bus.
