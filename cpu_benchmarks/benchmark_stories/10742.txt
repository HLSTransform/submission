Once upon a time, there was a silly cat named Tom. Tom loved to play outside. One sunny day, Tom went outside to scatter leaves in the yard. He ran and jumped, scattering the leaves all around.
While he was playing, Tom saw a big dog. The dog said, "Woof! What are you doing, silly cat?" Tom was in shock! He had never seen such a big dog before. He said, "I am just scattering the leaves. It's fun!"
The big dog thought it looked fun too. He decided to join Tom and they played together, scattering the leaves all over the yard. They had a great time and became good friends. From that day on, Tom and the big dog played together every day, and they were never scared or in shock again.
