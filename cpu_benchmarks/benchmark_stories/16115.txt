Once there was a bear. He was very stubborn. He liked to wander in the woods, and disturb all the other animals.
One day, the bear came upon a pond. He wanted to drink, so he went in. But he was so stubborn that he wouldn't stop swimming, even when the water was too deep.
But the bear did not realize that there was a big fish just beneath the surface. The fish was bigger than the bear and much stronger. The fish caught the bear in its jaws and dragged him underwater.
The bear kept struggling, but it was no use. He could not free himself. Eventually, the bear stopped moving.
The stubborn bear was never seen again.
