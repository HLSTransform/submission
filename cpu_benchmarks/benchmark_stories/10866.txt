Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go fishing with his grandpa. They would go to the lake and try to catch fish. One day, they saw an ancient boat by the shore. Timmy's grandpa said, "Let's go check it out!" They got into the boat and saw a big net. Timmy asked, "What is that?" His grandpa said, "It's a net we use to catch fish." Timmy was excited to try it out. They threw the net into the water and waited. Suddenly, they caught a big fish! Timmy was so happy and said, "We caught a fish with the net!" His grandpa smiled and said, "We sure did, Timmy. Let's catch some more!"
