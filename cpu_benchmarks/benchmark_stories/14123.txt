Once upon a time, there were two brothers, Bob and Tony. Bob always complained about everything. Tony on the other hand, was kind and regular.
One day, the two boys were in the kitchen with their mother. She gave them each a piece of cake. Tony was happy with his piece, but Bob wasn't. He started to complain saying that he wanted the bigger piece.
But the mother said, "Bob, complaining doesn't make anything better. You should take it in a good way and be grateful for what you have. Kindness is what makes us better."
Bob realised how his complaining was bad and how he shouldâ€™ve been as kind and regular as Tony. After that, he was never heard complaining again.
