Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a favorite pillow that he loved to cuddle with every night. One day, Timmy's mommy noticed that the pillow was very old and dirty. She told Timmy that they needed to throw it away and get a new one. Timmy was sad because he loved his pillow so much.
Timmy's mommy went to the store to buy a new pillow. When she came back, she showed Timmy the new pillow. Timmy was happy and hugged the new pillow tightly. But then he realized something. His old pillow was gone forever, and it made him feel a little bit dead inside.
Timmy said to his mommy, "Mommy, I miss my old pillow. It was my favorite. But I like this new pillow too." His mommy hugged him and said, "I know, Timmy. But sometimes we have to let go of old things and embrace new things. It's okay to feel sad, but it's also good to be open to new things." Timmy nodded and hugged his new pillow again. He realized that he could love his new pillow just as much as his old one.
