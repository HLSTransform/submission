Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved balloons. One day, she saw a big, red balloon and wanted it so much. But when she tried to grab it, the balloon flew away. 
Lily was sad and started to cry. Suddenly, a kind man appeared and asked her what was wrong. Lily told him about the balloon and the man said, "Don't worry, I'll get it for you." 
The man ran after the balloon and finally caught it. He came back to Lily and kneeled down to give her the balloon. Lily was so happy and gave the man a big hug. "Thank you for being so thoughtful," she said. The man smiled and walked away, happy to have made a little girl's day.
