Once upon a time there was a little girl called Putri. Putri was very clever and gifted. Every day she liked to go and explore the woods near her house.
One day, she went to the woods and saw a beautiful big lake. Putri had never seen a lake before and wanted to explore it more.
At the side of the lake, Putri found a special raft. It was made from wood and was very strong. She was very happy and decided to take the raft to explore the lake.
Putri took the raft and put it in the lake. As soon as she jumped on the raft, she began to feel the wind in her hair. She was so happy and fell asleep in the warm sun.
Putri dreamed about the wonderful things she would receive on her new adventure. When she woke up, the raft had taken her far away. She had received a wonderful new experience and will never forget it.
