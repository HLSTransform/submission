Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Bobbie. She was three. On a sunny day, Bobbie went to the park to meet her friends. When she got there, she was suprised to see something so sparkly. It was a little ornament! 
Bobbie wanted to play with it, so she picked it up. After a while, Bobbie's friends arrived. They were so excited to see the ornament! They started to play with it, rolling it around together. After a while, the park started to look very messy! 
Bobbie and her friends started to tidy up the park. They picked up the leaves, the sticks and the ornament. Then, they put it back on the ground. 
At the end of their playtime, Bobbie and her friends said goodbye. But, Bobbie made sure she took her special ornament home with her. She wanted to use it to decorate her bedroom!
