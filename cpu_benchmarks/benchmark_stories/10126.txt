Tom and Mia like to play with cards. They have many cards with pictures of animals, fruits, and colors. They play a game called match. They put all the cards face down and take turns to flip two cards. If the cards have the same picture, they match and they keep them. If the cards have different pictures, they do not match and they put them back.
One day, they go to the lake with their mom and dad. The lake is big and blue and has many fish and ducks. Tom and Mia bring their cards and a small blanket. They spread the blanket on the grass and start to play match. They flip the cards and look for matches. They find a card with a fish and a card with a duck. They do not match. They find a card with a banana and a card with a yellow color. They match and they smile.
They hear a splash and look up. They see a duck swimming in the lake. The duck is brown and white and has a green head. They look at their cards and see a card with a duck. The duck on the card looks like the duck in the lake. They match and they clap. They hear another splash and look up. They see a fish jumping out of the water. The fish is silver and shiny and has a red tail. They look at their cards and see a card with a fish. The fish on the card looks like the fish in the lake. They match and they cheer.
They have fun playing match and watching the animals in the lake. They are happy and proud of their matches. They hug their mom and dad and thank them for taking them to the lake. They pack their cards and their small blanket and go home. They can't wait to play match again.
