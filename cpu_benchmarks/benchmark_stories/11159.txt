Once upon a time, a rabbit named Benny was hopping in the spring. He saw his friend, a squirrel named Sammy, who was looking sad. Benny asked, "What's wrong, Sammy?"
Sammy replied, "I lost my favorite toy. I'm so foolish."
Benny said, "Don't worry, Sammy. I can lend you my toy until you find yours."
Sammy was happy and said, "Thank you, Benny! You're the best friend ever."
Benny and Sammy played together happily in the spring with Benny's toy. They had so much fun that Sammy forgot all about his lost toy. From that day on, Benny and Sammy were the best of friends and always helped each other out.
