Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl. They wanted to explore the world. One day, they came across an old tap. They were excited to examine it. They touched it and felt something wet and slimy.
The boy said, "It's slimy!" The girl asked him, "What is it?" The boy looked at the tap and said, "I don't know." He was feeling very ignorant.
They wanted to learn more about the tap, so they decided to pull it harder. Suddenly, a stream of water came out of the tap. The boy and girl were so surprised! They started playing in the water and had lots of fun. 
They had an exciting time examining the tap and discovering the stream of water.
