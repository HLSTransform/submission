Once upon a time, there was a queen who lived in a castle. She loved to swim in the deep blue sea. One day, she went for a swim and her crown fell off her head and sunk to the bottom of the sea. The queen was very sad and asked her helpers to fix the problem.
The helpers tried to find the crown but the sea was too deep. They searched and searched but couldn't find it. The queen was very upset because the crown was very special to her. She didn't want to be queen anymore without her crown.
Sadly, the queen had to give up her throne because she didn't have her crown. She went to live in a small cottage by the sea and spent her days looking out at the deep blue water, wishing she could have her crown back. And that's how the story ends, with the queen feeling sad and without her crown.
