Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she found a beautiful lily in the garden. She picked it and brought it inside to show her mom.
"Look, Mommy! I found a pretty lily!" Lily said.
"That's lovely, dear. Why don't we paint a picture of it together?" her mom suggested.
Lily was excited to paint with her mom. They got out the paint and brushes and started to paint the lily. Lily was having so much fun, she didn't even notice how comfortable she was sitting next to her mom.
After they finished the painting, Lily's mom hung it up on the wall. Every time Lily looked at it, she remembered the fun she had painting with her mom. From then on, every time they saw a lily, they would smile and remember their special painting day.
