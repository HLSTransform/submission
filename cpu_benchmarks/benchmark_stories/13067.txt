Jake wrote a bright message on a piece of paper. He ran to the garden and put the paper in the big pit. He laughed out loud as he heard happy shouts from the pit.
His sister, Jenna, had been missing for the whole day. All of a sudden, she jumped out of the pit with a smile on her face.
Jake hugged his sister and asked, "What did you do in the pit?"
Jenna smiled and said, "I wrote a bright message with crayons. I wanted to show everyone how much I love them."
Jake was very proud of his sister. He smiled and said, "We should write more bright messages and put them in the pit!" Jenna nodded and said, "Yes, that sounds like fun."
The two of them grabbed some paper and crayons, and went to the pit to write more bright messages.
