Lily and Ben are twins. They live in a big, modern house with many rooms and toys. They like to play together, but sometimes they fight. One day, they fight over a puzzle. Lily wants to make a flower, but Ben wants to make a car.
"Give me that piece!" Lily says. She pulls the puzzle piece from Ben's hand.
"No, it's mine!" Ben says. He pushes Lily away.
"Stop it, both of you!" Mom says. She hears them fighting from the kitchen. She comes to the playroom and sees the puzzle on the floor. "Why are you fighting? You have so many toys to share."
"But he took my piece!" Lily says.
"But she took my piece!" Ben says.
Mom sighs. She picks up the puzzle and puts it on the table. "How about we make a new puzzle together? One that has both flowers and cars. Then you can both have what you want."
Lily and Ben look at each other. They feel sorry for fighting. They nod and hug Mom. "Okay, Mom. We're sorry. We'll make a new puzzle."
Mom smiles and hugs them back. "That's good. I love you both. Now let's have some fun and make a beautiful puzzle."
They sit on the table and start to make the new puzzle. They take turns and help each other. They hear Mom humming a song in the kitchen. They feel happy and calm. They have peace in their hearts.
