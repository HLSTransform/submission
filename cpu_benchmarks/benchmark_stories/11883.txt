Sam was five years old and on a sunny day, he and his mommy were playing outside in their big backyard. Suddenly, Sammy saw something high above in the sky. It was a big, shiny goose! He turned to his mom and said excitedly, "Mommy, look! A goose!" 
His mommy replied, "Yes, Sammy, and it looks like it's going to land in our backyard!" She pointed in the direction of a clump of tall grass. After a few moments, Sammy could see the goose beginning to descend. 
He ran to the tall grass and waited expectantly. When the goose was almost close enough to the ground, Sammy shouted, "Mommy! It's gonna try to match!" His mommy smiled in understanding and through the tall grass, Sammy could see the goose's long neck unfold as it gently touched down. 
Sammy felt so glad as he had been waiting a long time for the goose to land. He loved the way it had matched his enthusiasm with perfect grace and ease. He thought that this was the most exciting thing that had ever happened in the backyard before. His mommy too was glad this had happened, and the two of them watched in wonder as the big, shiny goose walked away.
