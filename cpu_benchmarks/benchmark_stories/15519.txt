Once upon a time, there was a cup that was perfect. Every day it stayed in one place. But one day, something special happened to the cup!
The cup was lifted up. It flew up and up, higher and higher! Suddenly, it was released from the hand that was holding it.
The cup came down, down, down. It bounced once, then again, before it finally came to rest. For just a moment, everything was still.
Then, the cup started to feel happy. It had been released! Now it could see the world and it could move. It was free!
