Once upon a time, there was a little frog called Hop. He lived in a pond near a tall tree. One day he hopped out of the pond and saw something sparkly. He hopped closer and saw it was a spear! He knew the spear would be perfect for playing in the pond.
He jumped up and grabbed it in his froggy hands. When he tried to hop away with it, he noticed it was too heavy. But he was so excited, he hopped as fast as he could!
But soon his arms started to feel tired, he was so small and the spear was so heavy. He hopped and hopped, but he could feel it start to slip away from his hands. Suddenly, the spear broke into a million pieces!
The spear was so fragile and it felt like his heart was breaking too. The little frog started to cry, and cried until he hopped back to the pond. He knew that he'd never be able to get a new spear. And he wished he had been more careful.
