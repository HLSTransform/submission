Once upon a time, in a charming little town, there was a big park. The park had many trees, flowers, and a big pond. Kids loved to play in the park every day.
One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mom. They played on the swings, and Lily was very happy. Then, her mom said, "Lily, let's go home." But Lily wanted to stay and play some more.
Lily did not listen to her mom and ran to the pond. She saw a big rock and wanted to cover it with leaves. While she was playing, she fell into the pond. Lily's mom heard her cry and came running. She jumped into the pond and pulled Lily out. They went home all wet and sad.
