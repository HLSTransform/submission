Once upon a time, there was a smelly door. Every day a big bear would come to the door to feed. He would open the door, put food inside and close it again.
One day a little toddler saw the bear feeding. He was so excited he ran up to the door to get some of the food. But the bear was too fast! He closed the door before the toddler could get to it.
The toddler was sad, but he didn't give up. Every day he came back to the smelly door. The bear kept coming back, too. He opened the door, put food inside, but he was careful to close it quickly before the toddler could get it. 
But one day the bear was too slow. The toddler was able to reach the door before it closed - and he got to eat some of the food! 
The bear and toddler were happy and ever since then, they have been good friends. The bear still comes to the smelly door everyday to feed - and now he always leaves some food especially for the toddler.
