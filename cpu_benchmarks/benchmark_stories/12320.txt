Mum and Dad were having an argument. Dad was getting very angry. Mum said, "Please relax. We can talk about this."
Dad shouted, "No! You are being very rude!"
Mum gave Dad a look and said, "No need to be so rude."
Dad saw the look and calmed down. He said, "You're right. I'm sorry."
Mum smiled and said, "Let's relax and talk about this calmly."
They both sat down, and talked in a calm voice. In the end, they both agreed on the best solution.
Mum and Dad hugged and said, "Let's never argue like that again." They both laughed, and Mum said, "Let's relax and have some fun!"
