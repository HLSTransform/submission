Lily and Sam loved to bake with Mom. They put on their aprons and washed their hands. Mom gave them a big bowl and some cups. She said, "We are going to bake a cake for Dad. He is coming home from the east. He works very hard there. He will be very happy to see us and eat our cake."
Lily and Sam helped Mom measure the flour, the sugar, the eggs, and the milk. They poured them into the bowl and stirred with a big spoon. Mom added some vanilla and some chocolate chips. She said, "This is a special cake. It has a surprise inside. When we cut it, we will see the chocolate chips. They will be melted and gooey. They will make the cake taste incredible."
Lily and Sam smiled and licked the spoon. Mom put the cake in the oven and set the timer. She said, "Now we have to wait for the cake to bake. It will take about an hour. Do you want to play a game while we wait?" Lily and Sam nodded and ran to the living room. They played with their blocks and their dolls. They made a tower and a house. They had fun.
After a while, they heard the timer beep. They ran to the kitchen and saw Mom take the cake out of the oven. It smelled delicious. It was golden and fluffy. Mom said, "The cake is ready. We have to let it cool down a bit before we frost it. Do you want to help me make the frosting?" Lily and Sam said, "Yes, please!" They helped Mom mix some butter, some sugar, some milk, and some cocoa. They spread the frosting on the cake and sprinkled some sprinkles on top. They wrote "Welcome home, Dad" with some icing.
They put the cake on a plate and carried it to the table. They heard the door open and saw Dad walk in. He looked tired but happy. He said, "Hello, my loves. I missed you so much. What is this?" He saw the cake and smiled. He said, "Wow, what a beautiful cake. Did you make it for me?" Lily and Sam said, "Yes, we did. We baked it with Mom. It has a surprise inside. It is incredible. We love you, Dad." Dad hugged them and kissed them. He said, "I love you, too. You are the best. Thank you for the cake. Can we have a slice?" Mom said, "Of course. Let's eat." They cut the cake and saw the chocolate chips. They were melted and gooey. They made the cake taste incredible. They ate the cake and talked about their day. They were happy. They were a family.
