Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the garden. They see a big sunflower. It is yellow and bright. It has many seeds.
"Look, Sara, the sunflower is so pretty!" Ben says.
"Yes, it is. It bloomed because of the sun and the water," Sara says.
They go closer to the sunflower. They want to touch it. But the sunflower has a stem. The stem has sharp things. They are called thorns.
"Ow!" Ben cries. He touches a thorn. It hurts his finger. He sees blood.
"Ben, are you okay?" Sara asks. She is scared.
"It hurts, Sara. The sunflower is mean. It hurt me," Ben says. He is angry.
"No, Ben, the sunflower is not mean. It has thorns to protect itself. It does not want to hurt you," Sara says. She tries to calm him.
She takes a leaf. She wraps it around his finger. She hugs him.
"Let's go to mom. She will make it better," Sara says.
They leave the sunflower. They go to mom. Mom cleans his finger. She puts a band-aid on it. She kisses it.
"There, there. You are brave, Ben. The sunflower did not mean to hurt you. It is just a plant. It does not know," mom says.
"Thank you, mom. I feel better. I am sorry, sunflower. I did not mean to bother you," Ben says.
He smiles. He waves to the sunflower. The sunflower nods. It is happy. Sara and Ben are happy too. They learned something new. They are still friends. They love the garden.
