Once upon a time, a little girl named Sally had a very big problem. She needed a special pin to open a box, but the pin was unknown. Sally searched high and low, but she couldn't find it anywhere. 
Then, Sally had a great idea. She went into the woods and asked the animals if they knew where the pin was. A furry fox had heard of the pin and said it was hidden inside a flower. Sally ran to the flower and found the pin nestled inside its petals. She had everything she needed. 
Sally hurried back to the box and stuck the pin in the hole. The box opened and inside was a beautiful surprise - a special present just for Sally! She was so happy and her problem was solved. She had found the pin she needed.
The end.
