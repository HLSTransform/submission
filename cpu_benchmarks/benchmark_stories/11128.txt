Once upon a time, there was a lonely tree. The tree had no friends. It stood in a row with other trees, but they were far away.
One day, a little bird came to the tree. The bird was tired and needed a place to rest. The tree let the bird sit on its branch. The bird was happy and gave the tree a big squeeze with its wings.
From that day on, the tree and the bird were best friends. They were not lonely anymore. They played together every day, and the tree was very happy to have a friend.
