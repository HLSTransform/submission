Once there were two friends, named Sam and Joe. Sam wanted to decorate, so he asked Joe for help. Joe found some cool things in his house. He had lots of colors, and some fun shapes.
One thing he had was a big mustache. Joe thought it would be fun to decorate the mustache with the different colors. So Sam and Joe got to work.
First, they took all the bright colors and put them on the mustache. Then, they added some shapes like stars and hearts. Finally, they added some sparkles and it looked so cool!
Sam and Joe were very proud of their work. They both thought the decorated mustache looked amazing.
Sam and Joe had a lot of fun together that day. Decorating the mustache was a great way to express their creativity.
