Once upon a time there was a happy little boy called Tom. Tom loved to joke and make people laugh. One day, Tom and his family were visiting a big old castle. Inside the castle was a huge chamber with a high ceiling and windows all around it. 
Tom and his family stopped to admire the room, which was very calm and peaceful. But then something strange happened. Tom started to joke around and started to make funny noises and silly faces. Suddenly, the chamber filled with laughter. 
Tom's mum smiled and said, "Oh Tom, what a joker you are!" Tom felt very proud and kept on making people laugh. Everyone was filled with joy. Tom knew he had made the chamber smile.
