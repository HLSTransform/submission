Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mary. Mary took a step onto her bed and felt a funny feeling on her feet. She looked down, and saw that the bed was covered with a big, soft sheet. She started to jump on the bed and the sheet felt so deep! 
Mary said to her mom, "Mommy what is this thing?"
"That's a sheet, sweetie," said Mommy. "We use them to make our beds feel comfy and cozy." 
Mary smiled and said, "Mommy can we play a game?"
Mommy smiled, and said, "Yes! Let's jump in the sheet!" 
So Mary and Mommy jumped into the deep sheet, laughing and giggling. Mary felt so happy to be playing with her mommy. They jumped up and down in the sheet until they were too tired to jump anymore. 
Mommy then tucked Mary into bed, giving her a big hug and kiss. Mary smiled as she snuggled into the deep, soft sheet, and drifted off to sleep.
