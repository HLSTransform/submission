Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play outside with their kites. One day, the wind was very strong. It made their kites fly high and fast.
"Look, Lily, my kite is so high!" Tom said. "I can lift it more and more!"
"Be careful, Tom," Lily said. "The wind is bad today. It can break your kite or take it away."
But Tom did not listen. He wanted to lift his kite higher than Lily's. He pulled hard on the string. He did not see the big tree behind him.
Crash! The kite hit the tree and got stuck. The string broke and the wind took the kite away. Tom was sad. He lost his kite.
"I'm sorry, Tom," Lily said. "Do you want to share my kite?"
Tom nodded. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend. I was silly. I should have listened to you. The wind was bad today."
Lily smiled. She gave Tom half of her string. They flew the kite together. They learned to be careful and to share. The wind was still strong, but they had fun.
