Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy car that he loved to play with every day. One day, Timmy's mom told him that they were going to sell the car because they needed more money for food. Timmy was sad, but he understood that it was important. 
After they sold the car, Timmy and his mom cleaned the house. They dusted the shelves and the tables. Timmy thought it was fun to watch the dust fly in the air. 
Later that day, Timmy's dad came home with an impressive surprise. He had bought Timmy a new toy car! Timmy was so happy and he hugged his dad tight. He knew that they didn't have much money, but his dad still found a way to make him smile.
