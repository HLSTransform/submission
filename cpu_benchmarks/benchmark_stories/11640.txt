Once upon a time there was a smart little girl called Daisy. Daisy was very alert and was always looking around and trying to learn new things. 
One day, Daisy was looking in the kitchen and she spotted a big jar full of lollipops. She wanted to try one, so she asked her mom, "Can I have a lollipop?". 
Her mom smiled and said,"Yes Daisy, you can have a lollipop, but you will need to ask nicely."
So Daisy crossed her hands and said politely, "Can I please have a lollipop?". 
This time her mom nodded and said, "Yes of course, you can have one. Just be careful not to eat too many!" 
Daisy was very happy and raced over to the jar to get a lollipop. She grabbed one and ran off to enjoy it. 
The end.
