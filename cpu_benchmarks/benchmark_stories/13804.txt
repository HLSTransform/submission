Ben and Lily were very happy. They were going to see fireworks with Mom and Dad. They put on warm coats and hats and went to the park. They saw many people and lights and heard loud noises.
"Look, Ben, look!" Lily said. "Fireworks! They are so pretty! They glow in the sky like stars!"
"Yes, they do!" Ben said. "They make shapes and colors and sounds! I like the red ones and the blue ones and the green ones!"
Mom and Dad smiled and gave them tasty snacks. They had cookies and juice and popcorn. They ate and watched the fireworks. They felt cozy and safe.
But then something bad happened. A firework did not go up in the sky. It stayed on the ground and exploded. It made a big fire and smoke and sparks. It hurt some people and scared many people. Ben and Lily were very close to the firework. They screamed and cried.
"Mom! Dad! Help!" they shouted.
Mom and Dad ran to them. They tried to protect them from the fire and the smoke and the sparks. But they were too late. The firework burned them and their coats and hats and snacks. They felt pain and fear and sadness.
They did not see any more fireworks. They only saw fire and smoke and sparks. They only heard screams and cries and sirens. They only smelled smoke and burned things. They only tasted ash and blood.
They wished they never went to see fireworks. They wished they stayed home and played and read and hugged. They wished they were happy again. But they were not. They were hurt and scared and sad. The end.
