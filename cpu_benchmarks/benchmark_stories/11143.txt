Once upon a time, there was a kind lady named Mrs. Smith. She loved to watch cartoons on her TV. One day, she went to the store to buy some toys for the children in her neighborhood. She was very generous and wanted to make the kids happy.
At the store, she found a box of puzzle pieces. The pieces were all mixed up and didn't match. Mrs. Smith thought it would be fun to put the puzzle together and give it to the kids. She bought the puzzle and went back home.
When she got home, she started to put the puzzle together. It was very hard, but she didn't give up. Finally, she finished the puzzle and it showed a picture of a cartoon character. The kids were so happy when they saw the puzzle. They thanked Mrs. Smith for being so generous and making their day.
