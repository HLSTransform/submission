Lily was sick and had to go to the hospital. She did not like the hospital. It was big and loud and scary. She missed her home and her toys and her mom and dad.
One night, she had a dream. In her dream, she saw a big, soft bear. The bear was friendly and smiled at her. He said, "Hello, Lily. I am here to make you feel better. Do you want to play with me?"
Lily nodded and smiled back. She liked the bear. He was warm and cuddly and fun. He gave her a hug and said, "Don't be afraid, Lily. You are brave and strong. You will get well soon and go back to your home and your toys and your mom and dad."
They played together in the dream. They sang songs and told stories and laughed. Lily felt happy and safe with the bear. She forgot about the hospital and the pain and the fear.
When she woke up, she saw her mom and dad by her bed. They looked happy and proud. They said, "Good morning, Lily. We have good news. The doctor said you are much better and you can go home today. How do you feel?"
Lily felt good. She remembered her dream and the bear. She said, "I feel good, mom and dad. I had a dream. I met a big, soft bear. He was my friend. He made me feel better. Can I take him home?"
Her mom and dad smiled and hugged her. They said, "Of course, Lily. You can take him home. He is your special friend. He will always be with you in your heart." They gave her a big, soft bear to hold. It looked just like the one in her dream. Lily hugged the bear and smiled. She was happy and ready to go home.
