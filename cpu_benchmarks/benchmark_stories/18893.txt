Ben likes to play with his bow and arrow. He makes them from sticks and string. He shoots at cans and bottles in the yard. He is very good at it.
One day, he sees a big bird in the tree. He wants to shoot it. He thinks it will be fun. He takes his bow and arrow and sneaks up to the tree. He aims at the bird.
But his mom sees him. She is angry. She runs to him and stops him. She says, "No, Ben, no! You cannot shoot the bird. It is alive. It is not a toy. It will hurt the bird. It is wrong."
Ben does not understand. He likes the bird. He thinks it is pretty. He wants to play with it. He says, "But, mom, why? I just want to see it. I will not hurt it. I will be gentle."
His mom shakes her head. She says, "Ben, listen to me. The bird is not for you. It is wild. It has a family. It has a home. It does not want to be with you. It will be scared. It will try to fly away. It will not like your arrow. It will make it bleed. It will make it die. Do you want that?"
Ben feels sad. He does not want that. He loves the bird. He does not want to make it bleed. He does not want to make it die. He says, "No, mom, no. I do not want that. I am sorry. I did not know."
His mom hugs him. She says, "It's okay, Ben. I know you did not know. You are a good boy. You are learning. But you have to be careful. You have to be kind. You have to respect the bird. And all the animals. They are not toys. They are living things. They have feelings. They have rights. Do you understand?"
Ben nods. He understands. He says, "Yes, mom, yes. I understand. I will be careful. I will be kind. I will respect the bird. And all the animals. I will not shoot them. I will only shoot cans and bottles. And maybe some balloons. Is that okay?"
His mom smiles. She says, "Yes, Ben, yes. That is okay. That is good. That is fun. You can shoot cans and bottles. And maybe some balloons. But not the bird. And not any animal. Promise me."
Ben promises. He says, "I promise, mom. I promise." He puts down his bow and arrow. He looks at the bird. He says, "Bye, bird. I am sorry. I hope you are happy. I hope you have a good day."
The bird chirps. It flaps its wings. It flies away. Ben waves. He feels better. He learned something. He says, "Mom, can we go get some ice cream?"
His mom laughs. She says, "Sure, Ben, sure. Let's go get some ice cream. You deserve it. You are a good boy. I love you."
She takes his hand. They walk to the car. They go get some ice cream. They have a good day.
