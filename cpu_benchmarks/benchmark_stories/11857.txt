Once upon a time there was a big box. Inside was a special gift. It was a box full of gold. The gold was so shiny and sparkly!
The box was so big, and it was locked with a key. But nobody knew where the key was. Everyone was sad and worried because they could not open the box.
But then a very thoughtful man came and asked the people to look in their pockets. In one of the pockets was the key!
The man opened the box, and everyone was so excited to see the gold. They all celebrated and had a great time!
