Once upon a time there was a little girl who loved to swim. She went to the beach everyday and happily splashed around in the water. One day, while she was swimming, something strange happened. Out of the deep sea came a skeleton!
The little girl was so scared she stopped swimming and began to tremble. The skeleton looked like it was made of light, and he was looking right at her.
"Don't be afraid," said the skeleton in a deep, kind voice. "I just want to play with you."
The little girl hesitated, but eventually she decided to swim with the skeleton. They had so much fun!
But then, something dark happened. The skeleton suddenly started to swim faster, heading straight for the ocean depths. The little girl tried to keep up with him, but it was too late. He was gone, and she was left in the water, alone and scared.
The little girl started to cry. She had wanted nothing more than to make a new friend, but it had all ended in disaster. In the end, she never saw the skeleton again.
