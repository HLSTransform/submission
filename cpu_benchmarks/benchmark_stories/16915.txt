Tom and Lily were playing in the backyard with their flashlights. They liked to pretend they were explorers in the dark. They made noises like animals and shone their lights on the trees and flowers.
"Look, Lily, I found a cute bug!" Tom said, pointing his flashlight at a small green beetle. "It has spots on its back and it glows in the dark!"
"Wow, Tom, that is a cute bug!" Lily said, coming closer to see. "Can I hold it?"
Tom nodded and gently picked up the beetle. He handed it to Lily, who smiled and stroked its shell. The beetle glowed brighter and made a soft buzzing sound.
Suddenly, they heard a loud siren from the street. They saw a big red truck with flashing lights and a loud horn. It was an emergency truck. It stopped in front of their house.
"Oh no, what's wrong?" Lily asked, worried. She put the beetle back on the ground and ran to the fence with Tom.
They saw their mom and dad come out of the house. Their mom looked scared and their dad had a bandage on his hand. He was holding a burned pot.
"Mom, Dad, what happened?" Tom asked.
"Your dad tried to cook dinner, but he forgot to turn off the stove. He burned his hand and the pot. The smoke alarm went off and the emergency truck came to help," their mom explained.
"Are you okay, Dad?" Lily asked.
"I'm okay, sweetie. It's just a small burn. The nice people from the emergency truck gave me some medicine and a bandage. They also checked the house and said it's safe," their dad said.
He hugged Lily and Tom and kissed their mom. "I'm sorry I ruined dinner. How about we order some pizza instead?"
"Yay, pizza!" Tom and Lily cheered.
They went inside the house with their mom and dad. They left their flashlights and the cute bug in the backyard. The bug glowed happily and flew away.
