Once upon a time there was a poor man. He was feeling a bit stressed, so he decided to try and relax. He thought that maybe a nice walk would help. But when he was walking through the forest, he heard a loud noise - it was a pistol!
The poor man was scared and he quickly hid behind a tree. A big, mean-looking man with a pistol stepped out. He looked around and said: "If I see anyone, I'm gonna shoot!".
The poor man was terrified and he started shaking. He put his hands in the air and said: "I won't tell anyone, please don't hurt me!".
The big man laughed and said: "Good - now relax and nobody will get hurt." The poor man was relieved and he slowly started to relax. After a few moments, the big man said: "Good. Now you can go."
The poor man was so happy that he walked away as quickly as he could. He was determined never to go back to that forest again. He went home and he was never stressed again!
