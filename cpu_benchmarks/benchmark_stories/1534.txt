The train was impressive. It was big and shiny. Jenna looked out the window and gasped with delight. The scenery flew past as the train sped down the track.
Jenna's mom leaned over and asked, "Do you want to know a secret?" Jenna's eyes lit up and she nodded. Mom continued, "I can lift the train!" Jenna's jaw dropped. She said, "Really?"
Mom smiled and said, “Yes, I can lift the train up with my hands!” Jenna thought it was so cool. “Can you teach me how to do it?” she asked eagerly. Mom nodded and said, “Maybe one day when you get bigger, I'll show you!” 
Jenna couldn't wait. She kept smiling as the train rolled on, admiring the impressive sight outside her window.
