Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who lived in a big palace. She loved to dance and sing in the gardens. One day, she heard a loud noise coming from the forest.
The princess was scared, but her father, the king, told her not to worry. He said he would send his bravest knight to investigate. The knight rode his horse into the forest and found a big bear. The bear was angry because he had a thorn in his paw.
The knight knew how to help the bear. He paused for a moment and carefully removed the thorn. The bear was grateful and ran away. The princess was happy that the knight saved the bear. She knew he was very brave and deserved a reward. So, the king made him a special dinner and the princess danced for him in the beautiful palace gardens.
