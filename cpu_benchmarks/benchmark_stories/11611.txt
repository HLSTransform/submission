Once upon a time there lived a family of ducks. One day, the family wanted to go on a trip. So, the family went to the pond and hopped onto the bus, which was busy with other ducks. 
The bus was taking them to the park, but it had a little problem. Every time the bus stopped, all the ducks would hear a printing sound. They asked the driver who told them that the printer on the bus had broken. 
The ducks tried to fix it, but they were too busy. The family knew they wouldn't be able to make it to the park if the printer stayed broken, so they worked hard to fix it. 
Finally, they got it working again! All the ducks cheered and the bus went on the trip. 
When they reached the park, they had a great time. The family and all the ducks were so happy that they had managed to fix the printer and take the trip.
