Mia was a three-year-old girl who had very beautiful, long, white hair. Her parents always made sure she combed her hair every day before going to bed. She enjoyed it very much, especially when the shiny teeth of the comb caught the light of the stars when it went through her hair.
One day, Mia asked her dad "Why do I need to comb my hair? Is it because you care about me?"
Her dad smiled and said "Yes, of course! I care about you very much, so that's why I want you to brush your hair. We want it to be clean and healthy. That's why we comb it".
Mia smiled and said "Okay, I will always comb my hair if it shows you care."
From that day on, Mia combed her beautiful, white hair every day. With her dad's help, she was always happy and her hair was always healthy and shining. With her dadâ€™s care, Mia and her hair were happy and healthy!
