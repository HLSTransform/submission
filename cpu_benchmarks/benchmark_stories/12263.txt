Once upon a time, there was a baby who lived in a big house. One day the baby was feeling very tired and her eyes grew heavy. She couldn't help it, and she started to yawn. The baby's yawns were so big that they even made her head hurt! 
Then suddenly, a sour smell filled the air. The baby got worried and looked around. She found that a small creature was pulling something from the kitchen. It was something sour - a lemon! The baby was very frightened and started to cry.
At that moment, the baby's mother heard the cries and came to help. She saw the little creature with the lemon and got angry. She yelled at the creature, scaring it away.
The baby was relieved and smiled. She was so happy to have her mother there with her. She hugged her and yawned one last time, feeling safe and secure.
