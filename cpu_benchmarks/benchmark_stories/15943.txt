Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in a big ocean with his friends. One day, Nemo saw a big octopus. The octopus was angry because Nemo and his friends were swimming near his home. The octopus squirted ink at Nemo and his friends to scare them away.
Nemo was scared and didn't know what to do. He swam away as fast as he could. But then he had an idea. He went back to his friends and told them to follow him. Nemo led his friends to the octopus' home and they all released a big cloud of ink. The octopus got so angry that he swam away and never bothered Nemo and his friends again.
From that day on, Nemo learned that sometimes you have to be brave and stand up to bullies. And sometimes, even the smallest fish can make a big difference.
