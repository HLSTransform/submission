Once upon a time there was an old man who lived all by himself. He had no one to care for him, so he was always very sad.
One day, a young boy and girl came to the old man's house. They smiled at him and said, “We want to care for you!”
The old man was so happy that he didn't know what to say! He was so grateful to have people to care for him.
The young boy and girl helped the old man do many things, such as washing his clothes and cooking his meals.
The old man was so happy that he decided that he wanted to thank them. He said to them, “I want to give you both a present. I want to be your judge!”
The boy and girl were so excited and accepted the old man’s offer to be their judge. They thanked him for being so kind and caring.
From then on, the old man was always there to judge them on their actions. He watched over them and made sure that they were always doing their best. He was like a father figure to them and they cared for him very much.
The old man became very happy and his days were filled with joy. He was surrounded by people who cared for him and it made him feel loved. The old man was thankful for the young boy and girl who had come into his life and brought him so much joy.
