Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was a happy daughter who loved to play and laugh. Lily had a very pretty red dress that she liked to wear all the time. Her mommy gave her the dress, and it made her feel special.
One sunny day, Lily's mommy said, "Let's go to the park!" Lily was excited and wanted to wear her red dress. She asked her mommy to help her dress in her favorite red dress. Her mommy helped her, and they were ready to go.
At the park, Lily played and laughed with her friends. They all liked her red dress too. They played on the swings and in the sandbox. When it was time to go home, Lily was happy she wore her red dress. She knew her mommy loved to see her smile in it.
