Lily liked to collect rocks. She had many rocks of different colors and shapes in her box. She was proud of her rocks and showed them to her friends.
One day, she saw a shiny rock in the park. It was the most beautiful rock she had ever seen. It sparkled in the sun and had many colors. She wanted to have it for her box.
She ran to the rock and picked it up. She looked around and saw a big rock nearby. She decided to replace the big rock with the shiny rock. She thought no one would notice.
But Sam saw what she did. Sam was playing with his ball in the park. He liked the big rock and used it as a goal. He was envious of Lily's shiny rock. He thought it was not fair that she took it.
He ran to Lily and said, "That is not your rock. You took it from the park. You have to give it back."
Lily did not want to give it back. She said, "No, it is my rock. I found it. You have many balls. You do not need the big rock."
They started to argue and tug at the shiny rock. They did not see the park ranger coming. He heard them and saw what they did. He was not happy.
He said, "What are you doing? You cannot take rocks from the park. They belong to everyone. You have to put them back where you found them."
He made Lily and Sam replace the rocks. He told them to say sorry to each other and to the park. He said, "You can look at the rocks, but you cannot keep them. You can find other things to play with and share with your friends."
Lily and Sam felt ashamed. They said sorry and put the rocks back. They decided to play with Sam's ball instead. They learned to respect the park and each other. They became friends and shared their toys. They still liked rocks, but they did not take them anymore.
