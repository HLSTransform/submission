Once upon a time, there was a red shell that lived on the beach. Every day, the shell weaved in and out of the warm sand as the sun shone down from the sky.
One day, the shell was feeling so happy that it decided to spread its joy. With a big swallow, it opened up and bloomed! The red petals were so bright, they spread their happiness across the whole beach.
The shell was glad that it could share its happiness with other things that lived near the beach. The seagulls shared their songs, the crabs scuttled around and the sea breezes blew around the happy shell.
At sunset, the shell closed its petals and went to sleep. As the sun set and the stars twinkled in the sky, the red shell dreamt of being happy again tomorrow.
