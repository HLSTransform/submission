Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the rain and jump in puddles. One day, she went outside to play and it started to rain. She ran around and got very wet. 
When she came back inside, her mom told her to take off her wet clothes and put them in the laundry. Lily remembered that her mom always said to soak the clothes before washing them. So, she put the clothes in a big bucket of water to soak.
Later that day, Lily and her family went out to eat at a restaurant. When they got back to their car, they realized they had locked the keys inside. Lily's dad was worried, but Lily had an idea. She remembered that she had seen a spare key hidden under a nearby rock. They found the key and were able to unlock the car.
Lily's family was so proud of her for being so smart and helpful. They didn't know that she had already shown her cleverness earlier that day when she remembered to soak the wet clothes. Even though she was only three years old, she was very good at remembering important things.
