Once upon a time there was a wealthy boy. He was very mean and loved to tease the other children. One day, he was playing with a shiny pin. He went to the park to find someone to tease.
He soon found a little girl, who was only three. The boy thought it would be fun to tease her with the pin. He showed the girl the pin, and she was so excited. She started to laugh and smile.
But then, the wealthy boy teasing her with the pin got too close. He accidentally poked the little girl with the pin! Ouch! The girl started to cry. She had never felt such pain.
The wealthy boy was scared. He ran away from the park, leaving the little girl all alone. He did not apologize or even look back. 
The little girl was so sad and scared. She had never been teased like that before. She never wanted to see the wealthy boy again. 
The end.
