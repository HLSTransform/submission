Sam laid on the grass and looked up at the sky. It was a beautiful, orange sky! Sam noticed something small flying around. It was a tiny butterfly with orange and black wings. The butterfly flew down and landed on a patch of oats. Sam sat up and smiled. He saw the butterfly open its wings, flutter around and lay on the oats. Sam laughed, he thought the butterfly was so happy! The butterfly flapped its wings again and flew away. Sam was sad to see it go, he shouted goodbye! He lay back on the grass and waited for it to come back.
