Once upon a time, there was a baby. The baby was very small and cute. The baby loved to play with toys and eat oranges. One day, the baby's mommy wanted to wrap the baby in a warm blanket. The baby felt cozy and happy in the blanket. The blanket was orange and soft. The baby fell asleep in the blanket and had sweet dreams. The end.
