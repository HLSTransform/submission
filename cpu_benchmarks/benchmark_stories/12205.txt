Once upon a time, Alfie and Molly were siblings. Molly had a computer at home, and every day she and Alfie would mix fun games and stories together with the computer!
Molly loved typing on the keyboard and seeing the colors on the screen. One day, she came up with a special new idea.
"Alfie, let's type a long story together!" Molly said.
"Oh, great idea!" Alfie said with a big smile.
So the siblings grabbed the laptop, cuddled up together and started typing away! They mixed characters and places and talked about adventures and things they wished they could do one day. 
The story was so long they got lost in it. They laughed and talked and stayed up until the sun came up. When they finished, the whole family was so proud of their story.
It was long and filled with fun, and all of their imaginations were mixed together in the story.
