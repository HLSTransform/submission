Once upon a time, there was a little crab named Sam. Sam lived in a big ocean with lots of other crabs. One day, Sam went out to play with his friends. They played tag and hide-and-seek. Sam was very good at hiding, he could hide in the sand and nobody could find him. 
Suddenly, a big wave came and washed Sam away from his friends. Sam was scared and didn't know where he was. He looked around and saw a big rock. He climbed up the rock and saw a harsh mark on it. He wondered what it was. 
Sam decided to stay on the rock for a little while. He watched the waves and the seagulls flying in the sky. After a while, the tide started to go down and Sam could see his friends on the beach. He was so happy to see them again. They all ran to him and gave him a big hug. From that day on, Sam always remembered the harsh mark on the rock and how it helped him find his way back to his friends.
