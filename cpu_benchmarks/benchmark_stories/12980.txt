Sarah and mommy were having a fun day at the park. Sarah kept running around and playing with her favorite toys. She laughed and giggled as she enjoyed the fresh air.
Mommy smiled and looked at Sarah with love. She said, "Remember, Sarah, be careful. The ground is rough."
Sarah nodded, understanding what mommy said. She wouldn't forget. 
Still, the park was so much fun that it was hard to keep track of where she ran. She had a great time playing with all of her friends. She even saw a few animals.
When it was time to go home, Sarah was sad. She turned to mommy and said, "Can we come back tomorrow? This was so much fun."
Mommy smiled and said, "Yes, Sarah. We can come back tomorrow, but remember to be careful. The ground can be rough." 
Sarah nodded and gave her mommy a big hug. She remembered what her mommy said and promised to be extra careful. They had a lot of fun together and Sarah couldn't wait to come back the next day.
