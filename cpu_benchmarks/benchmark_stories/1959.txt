Once there was a little girl who was feeling very lonely. No one ever wanted to play with her.
One day, the little girl got an idea. She decided to make something pretty so that maybe somebody would want to be her friend. She found some pretty pink paper, a pencil and some glue.
Then she started to make a very beautiful card. When she was done she felt very happy.
But then something terrible happened. When she was getting ready to give it to someone, she dropped it and it tore into pieces. She felt so sad and was about to cry.
Suddenly, her mommy came in. She saw the mess and asked why the paper was on the floor. The little girl told her mommy everything, she was so scared that she would be punished.
But her mommy was very kind. She hugged her and said that if she was careful the next time, there would be no need to punish her. And the little girl was very happy.
