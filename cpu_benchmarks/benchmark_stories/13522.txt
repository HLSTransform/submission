Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny had soft fur that felt nice to touch. One day, Benny went on a walk in the forest. He saw a big, wild bear. Benny was scared and ran away. 
But then, the bear called out to Benny, "Don't be scared little bunny, I won't hurt you." Benny stopped running and turned around to see the bear smiling at him. 
Benny was surprised that the big, wild bear was being so kind. They started talking and became friends. Benny learned that not all big, wild animals are scary. Sometimes they can be friendly too. From that day on, Benny and the bear went on many adventures together and always had big smiles on their faces.
