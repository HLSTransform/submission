Once upon a time there was a little boy called Tom. Tom loved playing with his blocks. He would build towers, castles and houses with them. 
One day, Tom's blocks got too close to the edge of the table. They started to topple over! Tom quickly ran to the table and managed to save all the blocks. 
Afterwards, Tom was feeling very happy and excited. He couldn't wait to build more towers and castles! But then, one of his friends, Max, came over. Max was feeling grumpy and wanted to join in. But Tom was not sure if he wanted to share his blocks. 
"Come on, Tom. Can I play with your blocks?" asked Max. 
Tom thought for a moment and then said, "I saved them all! They are mine". 
Max was feeling very sad now, but then Tom had an idea. He quickly moved the blocks over and said, "You can be the king of one tower and I can be the king of the other". 
Max smiled and said, "Yes, that sounds like a good plan!" 
Tom and Max built their towers together and had lots of fun. Tom was so glad he had managed to save his blocks. Everyone was happy in the end!
