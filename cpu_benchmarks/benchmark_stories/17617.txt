Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a special toy, a teddy bear that was very unique. It had a red bow on its neck and was very soft. One day, Lily accidentally tore the teddy bear's arm while playing with it. She was very sad and didn't know what to do. 
Her mommy saw what happened and told Lily not to worry. She took out a battery from a remote control and used it to fix the teddy bear's arm. Lily was amazed and happy that her teddy bear was fixed. She gave her mommy a big hug and thanked her for being so clever.
From that day on, Lily made sure to be extra careful with her special teddy bear, and she never forgot how her mommy fixed it with just a battery.
