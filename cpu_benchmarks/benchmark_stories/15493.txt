Once upon a time, there was a fragile dolphin. It was so small and gentle that it was hard to see it when it was swimming in the sea. But, every day, its size started to increase and it became bigger and bigger. Each day, it could see and explore more of the ocean.
Soon, it was swimming with its friends, and showing them all of the wonderful ocean life that it found. Fish, crabs, and even an octopus swam around. The dolphin was no longer fragile, and it felt strong and powerful.
It kept on increasing in size each day, until one day it even became the biggest one in its group. All of the other dolphins were amazed by this. The dolphin was so happy, and it jumped up out of the water and did a flip. The other dolphins started clapping to show how proud they were. 
The dolphin was so glad to be able to grow and explore the big ocean. From that day on, it never stopped increasing in size and becoming stronger and stronger.
