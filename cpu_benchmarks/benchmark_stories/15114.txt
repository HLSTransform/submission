One day, the village leaders decided that they would print a shield to keep the village safe and peaceful. Everyone in the village was very excited about the shield!
The village leaders spoke to the children about the shield. "We need to keep the shield safe and secure," they said.
The children nodded in agreement. They wanted to help keep the village peaceful.
One of the village leaders looked at the children and smiled. He said, "We need to print the shield carefully. Can you help us?"
The children clapped and said they wanted to help. They set to work and quickly printed the shield.
Everyone in the village rejoiced. They were happy that the shield was printed. The village remained peaceful.
