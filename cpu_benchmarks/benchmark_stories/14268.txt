Once upon a time there was a big house. Inside the house was a family. Every morning, the family would all go upstairs. Upstairs was a big, bright room.
The room had lots of toys. Every day, the family would fill the toys with lots of fun. They would play with them until night.
One day the family wanted to clean the room. So they cleaned it very well! It looked so clear and sparkly. They felt so proud of their work.
At the end of the day, the family was very tired. They all went to bed, ready for the next day. They knew the room would be filled with fun again!
