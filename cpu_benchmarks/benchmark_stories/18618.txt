Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy bracelet with a loop on it. The bracelet was very flexible, which meant she could stretch it and bend it however she wanted. 
One day, Lily was playing with her bracelet when it got stuck on her hand. She tried to pull it off, but it wouldn't budge. Her mom came to help and gently removed the bracelet from her wrist. 
Lily was very happy to have her bracelet back and decided to be more careful when playing with it. She loved how flexible it was and couldn't wait to show it off to her friends at school.
