Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a very tidy room, with all his toys put away in their proper places. One day, Timmy's mom told him that they were going to visit his grandma's house.
Timmy was excited to see his grandma, but he didn't want to leave his tidy room. "I don't want to go," Timmy said. "I want to stay here and play with my toys."
"Don't worry," said Timmy's mom. "We'll be back soon, and your room will still be tidy."
Timmy tried to resist, but his mom picked him up and carried him to the car. As they drove away, Timmy heard an alarm go off in the distance.
"Is that our house?" Timmy asked.
"Don't worry," said his mom. "It's just a car alarm. Our house is safe."
When they returned home, Timmy was happy to see that his room was still tidy. He realized that it was good to go on adventures and visit new places, but it was also important to take care of his home.
