Once upon a time, there was a naughty man. He liked to steal things that weren't his. One day, he saw a bicycle that he really wanted. He tried to take it away, but he was caught by a policeman. 
The policeman was very angry and took the naughty man straight to court. The naughty man needed a lawyer to help him, so he called one. The lawyer was very clever and knew the law very well. He tried to help the naughty man by making a case that would keep him free. 
Unfortunately, the judge was not impressed with the lawyer's case. He was too tight and wouldn't let the naughty man go free. The judge said that stealing was wrong and sent the naughty man to jail. 
The naughty man learned his lesson that day. He never wanted to steal anything ever again.
