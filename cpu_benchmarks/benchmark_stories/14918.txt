Once upon a time, there was a wild bear. He was walking through the woods when suddenly he heard the most delicious smell. It was sweet and tangy all at once. He sniffed the air, trying to figure out exactly what he was smelling. "What is that?" he said to himself out loud.
He followed the smell until he reached a berry bush. The berries were bright red and looked delicious. He reached out and plucked one off the bush. Then he carefully held it up to his nose and took a deep sniff. He couldn't believe how wonderful it smelled. He closed his eyes and tasted it. 
The wild bear was in heaven! The berry was so sweet and juicy it nearly melted in his mouth. He quickly gobbled up all the other berries. After he finished, the bear sat in the grass, very content. He enjoyed the silence and the warmth of the sun. All he could hear was the buzzing of bees and chirping of birds. 
Suddenly, he heard a giggle. He opened his eyes and saw a little girl in a pink dress standing in front of him. "Hello, Bear," she said with a smile. The bear was so surprised he nearly jumped out of his skin! But he soon forgot his surprise and they began to talk and laugh. 
The wild bear and the little girl became very good friends. Every day they would meet in the same spot
