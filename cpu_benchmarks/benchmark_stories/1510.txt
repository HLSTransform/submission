One night, John had to do something very tough. He grabbed his flashlight and stepped outside. As he came closer to the dark woods, his heart raced. There was no turning back now.
John walked and walked, until he saw something shining in the distance. Flashlight in hand, he cautiously came closer. It was a big bad wolf!
John was scared, but he didn't give up. He yelled, "Go away!" The wolf growled and stepped closer. Suddenly, John heard a noise coming from the bushes. It was his friends coming to help him!
John's friends ran over to him and started to throw stones at the wolf. The wolf was so scared that he ran away!
John and his friends were relieved and hugged each other. Thanks to the tough work of John and his friends, the night was saved!
