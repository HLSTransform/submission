Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She was very small and pale. One day, her father said to her, "Let's go on an adventure!" So, they set out on their adventure.
When they arrived at their destination, there was a wet, muddy puddle. Lucy wanted to go in it, but her Dad said, "No, Lucy. It's too wet and dangerous!". She pouted, but needed her Dad's support. Fortunately, her Dad smiled and said, "Perhaps we can cross over the puddle".
So, Lucy held her Daddy's hand and together they safely crossed the wet puddle. On the other side, was a beautiful garden! Lucy was so happy! She ran around the garden, enjoying all the different flowers, butterflies and birds.
Lucy and her Dad played together in the garden until the sun started to go down. Then, they went home, feeling very happy they had experienced such an adventure together. They could not wait until the next time they could have another adventure!
