Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweety. Tweety had a nest in a big tree. One day, Tweety went out to find some food for her babies. While she was gone, a big fire started in the forest. The fire was so hot that it burned the tree where Tweety's nest was.
When Tweety came back, she saw that her nest was gone. She was troubled and sad. She asked her bird friend, "Where is my nest?" Her friend said, "I am sorry, but it burned in the fire."
Tweety was very sad, but her friend helped her find a new place to make a nest. They found a nice tree with lots of leaves. Tweety was happy again and she made a new nest. She said to her friend, "Thank you for helping me. Now, my babies have a new home."
