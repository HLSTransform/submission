Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very hungry and wanted to eat something. He looked in the fridge, but there was nothing to eat. So, he went to his mom and asked for food. His mom gave him a sandwich and a juicy apple. Timmy ate the sandwich and the apple, but he was still hungry.
Then, he saw his pet dog, Max, playing with a pen. Timmy took the pen from Max and started drawing on a piece of paper. But, soon he got bored of drawing and decided to play hide and seek with Max. Timmy covered his eyes and counted while Max went to hide.
After a while, Timmy found Max hiding behind a curtain. Timmy was very happy to find Max and gave him a big hug. Then, Timmy's mom called him for dinner. Timmy was no longer hungry and enjoyed his dinner with his family.
