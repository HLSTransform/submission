One day, a cat named Tom was very comfortable in his home. His friend, a dog named Max, was giving him a nice massage. Tom was happy and loved the massage. They were best friends and always helped each other.
Suddenly, a big noise came from outside. Tom and Max started to panic. They did not know what the noise was. They were scared and ran around the house. They did not know what to do.
Then, Tom remembered that they should be brave and help each other. They went outside together and saw it was just a box that had fallen. They were not scared anymore. They learned that when they are together, they can face anything. The moral of the story is to always help your friends and be brave together.
