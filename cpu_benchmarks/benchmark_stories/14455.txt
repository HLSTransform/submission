Max was a very active little boy. Every morning he liked to go for a walk in the park with his mom. This morning was different. Max's mom was ready to go and Max was ready to join her, but he didn't want to. He wanted to stay home and make some jam. 
So Max's mom said, " Okay, we will quit our walk and make some jam". Max was so excited. He got a big bowl and some light coloured strawberries. He chopped the strawberries and mashed them to make the jam. 
Max put the jam in a jar and put it in the fridge. He couldn't wait for his family to try it. When his dad came home for lunch, Max said, "Let's have some jam with our lunch". His mom and dad said, "Wow, Max! You made some delicious jam! We can't wait to try it!" 
Max was very proud of himself and couldn't stop talking about his jam. From that day, every Saturday Max made light coloured strawberry jam for his family.
