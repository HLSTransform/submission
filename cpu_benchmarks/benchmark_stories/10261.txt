Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was very happy because he had an owner who loved him very much. Max's owner would always play with him and give him lots of treats.
One day, Max's owner had to go away for a long time. Max felt very lonely without his owner around. He missed playing with his owner and getting treats.
But one day, a nice lady came to Max's house. She wanted to adopt Max and take care of him. Max's owner was happy to hear this and agreed to let the nice lady adopt Max.
The nice lady promised to take good care of Max and pay for all his food and toys. Max was happy to have a new owner who loved him just as much as his old owner did.
