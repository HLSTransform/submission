Once there was a big, strong lion. He was walking through the jungle and he suddenly heard a sound. He quickly looked around and saw a small animal jumping and hurrying along. The small animal was scared and had a coat of fur.
"Where are you going in such a hurry?", asked the lion.
The small animal shook his head. He was too scared to talk.
The lion got angry and started chasing the small animal. The small animal kept running and hurrying as quickly as he could. He was scared and desperately wanted to get away.
The lion was too strong and he eventually caught the small animal. He opened his big mouth and the small animal was gone.
The moral of the story: Never forget to be careful when you are hurrying around.
