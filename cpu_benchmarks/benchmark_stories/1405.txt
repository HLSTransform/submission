Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Molly. Molly was a very happy little girl, always smiling and playing with her friends.
One day, Molly went to the park with her mom. Molly saw a big grey swan in the pond. She thought it was so beautiful, so she went up to it to give it a kiss. The swan had such a soft and puffy feathery weight. Molly loved it! 
Suddenly, an ugly old wizard appeared out of nowhere! He was really mad that Molly kissed the swan and he began waving his hands around, yelling and pointing angrily at Molly and her mom. Molly began to cry. 
But then something wonderful happened. The swan began to shine with a magical light and wrapped itself around Molly and her mom, making them feel very safe. Then, it flew away, taking the wizard with it.
Molly and her mom hugged each other tight and Molly smiled again. Molly knew that the swan had used its magical powers to save them. She learned that day to always be kind and loving.
