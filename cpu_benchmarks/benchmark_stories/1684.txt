Once upon a time, there was a wise old owl who lived in a big tree. One day, a little bird came to visit him. "Hello, Mr. Owl," said the little bird. "I need your help. My nest is too high up in the tree and I can't reach it."
The wise owl thought for a moment and then said, "I know just the thing. We'll use a crane to lift you up to your nest."
The little bird was very excited and said, "Thank you, Mr. Owl! You're so wise!"
They went to find a crane and soon the little bird was safely back in her nest. "Wow, this is amazing!" she said. "Thank you so much, Mr. Owl. You're the best!"
But the wise owl warned her, "Be careful not to spoil your nest too much. Remember, sometimes it's better to keep things simple." The little bird nodded her head and promised to be careful. And they both lived happily ever after.
