Tom and Lily like to play in the park. They run and jump and swing and slide. They have fun and get good exercise.
One day, they see a big dog in the park. The dog is black and furry and has a loud bark. Tom and Lily are scared of the dog. They think the dog will chase them and bite them.
They run away from the dog and hide behind a tree. They hug each other and hope the dog will go away. They hear the dog barking and running around the park.
But then, they hear another voice. It is a man. He says, "Rex, come here, boy. Good dog, Rex. Where are you, Rex?"
Tom and Lily peek from behind the tree. They see the man with a leash and a ball. He is looking for the dog. He is the dog's owner.
The dog sees the man and runs to him. He wags his tail and licks his face. He is happy to see the man. He is not a bad dog. He is a friendly dog.
The man sees Tom and Lily behind the tree. He smiles and waves at them. He says, "Hi, kids. Do you want to play with Rex? He is a good dog. He likes to play fetch and give kisses. He won't hurt you. He just wants to have fun."
Tom and Lily look at each other. They are not scared anymore. They are curious. They come out from behind the tree and walk to the man and the dog. They pet the dog and throw the ball for him. They laugh and play with him. They make a new friend.
They learn that the dog is not scary. He is good. They have more fun and get more exercise. They are happy.
