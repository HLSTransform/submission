Once upon a time there were two best friends, Joe and Tina. Joe was very curious and eager to find new things. One day, he noticed a spark in the distance and he urged Tina to go with him and find out what it was. 
They walked for miles and hours until they turned a corner and saw a house with a new fence. Joe was very excited and he quickly ran towards the fence to find a secret door. He opened the door and inside he found an abandoned room. 
They started to explore the room searching for the spark. Suddenly, Joe saw the spark glowing in the corner and he wanted to take it home. However, as soon as Joe reached for it the room locked them in and slowly started to fill up with water!
Joe and Tina scrambled to find a way out but it was too late. They were doomed. The spark had set them up for a bad ending. 
The End.
