Once there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to imagine. Every day Timmy would spend time imagining all sorts of things. One day, Timmy decided he wanted to read a newspaper. So he asked his dad for an honest newspaper. 
His dad thought for a moment and then said, "Let me get you a special newspaper from town." With that, the dad went to town and brought back a newspaper for Timmy. 
When his dad got back from town, he handed the newspaper to Timmy and said, "Read this newspaper, it's honest and filled with stories about things going on in the world." 
Timmy was so excited he could hardly contain himself. He opened up the newspaper and began looking through it. He read stories and looked at pictures. It was amazing! Timmy and his dad enjoyed talking about the different things they both read in the newspaper. 
Timmy was so happy he got to read his new honest newspaper. Every day he would look forward to reading more stories and looking at the pictures. It was an adventure!
