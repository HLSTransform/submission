Once upon a time there was a lovely frog. He lived in a pond near a big house. One day, the frog noticed a big net in the house's garden. He hopped over and tried to get the net. But it was too big for him! He felt so sad and bitter. 
Suddenly, he saw an old man in the garden. He asked the man, "Please, can you send me the net?". The old man smiled at the frog and said, "Yes, I can send you the net".
So, the man picked up the net, and he sent it to the frog. The frog was so happy! Now he could use the net to catch insects and have fun. The frog thanked the old man. 
The old man smiled and said, "You're welcome little friend!".
