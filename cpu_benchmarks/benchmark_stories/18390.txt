Once upon a time, there was a jolly little girl named Lily. She loved to walk in the park with her mommy and daddy. One day, while they were walking, Lily saw a pretty flower and wanted to pick it. But her mommy said no because it was too close to a big, scary dog.
Lily was sad and started to cry. Her daddy saw how upset she was and decided to help. He walked over to the flower and picked it for her. Lily was so happy and hugged her daddy tightly.
But then, the big, scary dog started to bark and run towards them! Lily's mommy and daddy quickly picked her up and ran away from the dog. They were safe, but Lily was still a little scared. Her daddy hugged her and told her everything was okay. From then on, they made sure to stay away from big, scary dogs when they went for walks in the park.
