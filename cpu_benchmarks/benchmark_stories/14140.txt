Once upon a time, two friends Jack and Jane were playing outside. Jack wanted to climb a fence but Jane said, "No Jack, it's too high!"
Jack wasn't sure what to do, but then he thought of a plan. He said, "Let's get some ice cream!" Jane was excited and they ran off to the shop.
When they arrived, Jack looked carefully. He chose the coldest ice cream he could find. He took two scoops for himself and two for Jane. When they had their ice cream, they sat on a bench and ate it.
The ice cream was delicious. It had a sweet taste and they enjoyed it together. When they finished, Jack said, "That was a great way to end the day!" Jane nodded and smiled.
