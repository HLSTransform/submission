Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a red dress that she loved to wear every day. One day, Lily went to the park to play. There, she met a boy named Jack. Jack said, "I like your dress, it's so pretty." Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, it's my favorite color."
Jack said, "Do you want to play a game?" Lily nodded her head excitedly. Jack said, "Let's play a clapping game. We will clap our hands and say 'True' when we finish." Lily clapped her hands and said, "True!" Jack and Lily played the clapping game until it was time to go home. They said goodbye and promised to play again tomorrow.
