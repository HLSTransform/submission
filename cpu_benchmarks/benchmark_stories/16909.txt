Sara liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She painted flowers and trees and animals. She was happy when she painted.
But her baby brother did not like to paint. He was too small. He only liked to play with his toys. He made noises and threw things. He was boring to Sara.
One day, Sara had a new idea. She wanted to paint her baby brother. She thought it would be fun. She took her paints and went to his room. He was sleeping in his crib.
She painted his face and his hair and his clothes. She used red and blue and green and yellow. She made him look like a clown. She laughed and laughed.
But then her baby brother woke up. He saw his face in the mirror. He did not like it. He cried and cried. He was scared and sad.
Sara heard him cry. She felt bad. She ran to his room. She saw what she had done. She was sorry.
She hugged her baby brother. She said, "I'm sorry, baby. I was wrong. I should not have painted you. You are not boring. You are my brother. I love you."
She took a wet cloth and wiped his face. She cleaned his hair and his clothes. She made him look like himself again.
Her baby brother stopped crying. He smiled and hugged her back. He said, "I love you, Sara. You are my sister. You are not mean. You are nice."
They played together with his toys. They were happy.
The moral of the story is: Do not hurt or tease others for fun. Respect and love your family.
