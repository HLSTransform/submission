Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a dull day because it was raining outside. Lily was feeling sad because she wanted to play in the park with her friends. 
Lily's mom noticed that she was sad and asked her, "What's wrong, Lily?" Lily replied, "I want to play outside, but it's raining. I'm suffering because I'm bored." 
Her mom thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea. Let's have a picnic under the table!" Lily's face lit up with excitement and she said, "That sounds like fun!" 
So, they had a picnic under the table with sandwiches and juice. They played games and sang songs. Lily forgot about the rain and had a great time. She realized that even though it was raining outside, she could still have fun under the table with her mom.
