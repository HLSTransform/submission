Once upon a time there was a fox who was looking for an idea. He searched and searched but could not find one. He was feeling sad, when all of a sudden a rabbit hopped by. The rabbit said, “What are you looking for?” The fox told the rabbit his problem. The rabbit was so compassionate that he said, “I have an idea! You can lend some of my ideas.” The fox was very happy and thanked the rabbit. Soon enough, the fox had all the ideas he wanted. He was so pleased with the rabbit’s idea that he thanked him again. The rabbit smiled and they both went on their merry way.
