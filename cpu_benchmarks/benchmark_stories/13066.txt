Once there was a powerful gray elephant. He seemed to be an old elephant but he was also very strong. Every day he would walk through the jungle and everyone would watch him. He was so huge and powerful that no one dared to challenge him.
The small animals of the jungle were always so curious to know what he was thinking about. One day, a small monkey sprang up and perched on the elephant's trunk. The elephant couldn't help but seem to smile at the monkey and gently lifted him up to a tree.
The elephant seemed proud and happy to have another friend in the jungle. He seemed to enjoy teaching the monkey all the things he knew. They both would have fun playing together in the tree and eating the delicious jungle fruits.
At the end of the day, the powerful gray elephant and the small monkey said goodbye. It seemed as if the elephant was sad to see the monkey go, but he knew he would be back tomorrow.
