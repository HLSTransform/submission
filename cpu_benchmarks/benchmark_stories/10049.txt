Lily and Ben were playing in the yard. They liked to pretend they were spies and go on missions. They had a big car made of boxes and paper. They painted it red and blue and put stickers on it.
"Come on, Ben, we have to find the bad guys!" Lily said. She got in the car and put on her sunglasses. Ben followed her and took the wheel.
They drove around the yard, looking for clues. They saw a rope hanging from a tree. It had a sign that said "Do not touch".
"What is that?" Ben asked. He was curious.
"I don't know, but it looks like a trap!" Lily said. She was brave. "Maybe the bad guys are hiding up there. We have to check it out."
Lily got out of the car and walked to the rope. She pulled it hard. Suddenly, a bucket of water fell on her head. She was wet and cold.
"Ha ha ha!" A voice laughed. It was Tom, their big brother. He was hiding in the tree. He had made the trap to prank them.
"Tom, that's not funny!" Lily said. She was angry. "You ruined our mission!"
"Sorry, sis, I was just joking!" Tom said. He climbed down from the tree. "You have to admit, it was a good trap."
"No, it was a mean trap!" Ben said. He was loyal. "You should say sorry to Lily. She was very brave to pull the rope."
Tom looked at Lily. She was still wet and cold. He felt bad.
"OK, OK, I'm sorry, Lily. You were very brave. And your car is very cool." Tom said. He gave her a hug and a towel. "Can I play with you guys?"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They smiled.
"Sure, Tom. You can be our spy partner. But no more traps, OK?" Lily said.
"OK, OK, no more traps. Let's go on a mission together!" Tom said.
They got in the car and drove away. They were happy.
