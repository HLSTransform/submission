Once upon a time there was a big, expensive castle. Inside the castle was a huge skull made of gold. Everyone wanted it, but none of them could ever get it.
One day, a brave little boy came to the castle. His name was John, and he was only 3 years old. He wanted to get the skull, but he wasn't sure how to do it.
John decided to enter the castle. He crept in when no one was looking and he looked everywhere for the skull. He soon found it, hidden behind some furniture!
But when John tried to take it, a bad man suddenly appeared. The man wanted the skull too, and he said he wouldn't let anyone take it.
John bravely told the man that he wanted the skull and that he wouldn't let him have it. The man got angry and tried to fight John, but John was too quick. He ran away with the skull and never looked back!
