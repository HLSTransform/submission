Lily and Max were best friends. They liked to play outside in the sun. One day, they saw a big cloud in the sky. It was dark and scary.
"What is that?" Lily asked.
"It is a hurricane," Max said. "My mom told me. It is a big wind that can break things."
Lily was afraid. She did not want the hurricane to break her toys or her house. She wanted to go inside and hide.
"Let's test something," Max said. He had a plan. He was brave and curious. He took a tall stick and tied a red scarf to it. He ran to the hill and stuck the stick in the ground.
"What are you doing?" Lily asked.
"I want to see if the hurricane can blow away my flag," Max said. He smiled. He thought it was a fun game.
Lily followed him to the hill. She watched the stick and the scarf. The wind was getting stronger. The scarf was waving and flapping.
"Look, it is working!" Max said. He clapped his hands.
But then, the hurricane came closer. It was very loud and angry. It ripped the stick and the scarf from the ground. It threw them far away.
Lily and Max were shocked. They realized they were in danger. They ran back to their houses as fast as they could.
"Max, Lily, come inside!" their moms shouted. They were worried.
Lily and Max made it to their houses. They hugged their moms. They were safe.
They learned a lesson. They never tested a hurricane again.
