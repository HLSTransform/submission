It was a tidy sunny morning when Emily, a three year old, set out on her adventure. She was very excited to explore the world around her.
As Emily continued to walk, she noticed that the sky had turned dark and it started to rain. She was scared and didn't know what to do. Emily thought of going to the nearby subway station to wait until the rain stopped.
When Emily got to the subway station, she felt safe and secure. She looked around the station and saw different people. She felt overwhelmed and wanted to find someone familiar.
Just then, Emily saw her mom coming towards her in the station. She was so glad to see her mom and ran towards her. Her mom gave her a big hug and then they decided to go back home. 
Back home, Emily and her mom were both very relieved that they were safe and sound. Although the rain had caused a bit of a fright, everything was now tidy again. Emily would never forget this special adventure!
