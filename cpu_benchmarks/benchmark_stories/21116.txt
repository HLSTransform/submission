Once upon a time, in a cheerful forest, there lived a little girl named Lily. She loved to pick strawberries with her friends. One sunny day, Lily and her friends went to the strawberry field to pick some sweet strawberries.
While they were picking strawberries, Lily saw the biggest strawberry she had ever seen. She got very excited and called her friends, "Look at this big strawberry I found!" Her friends came running to see it. They all wanted to pick it together, but Lily wanted it all for herself.
Lily tried to reach the big strawberry, but it was high up on a hill. She climbed and climbed, but she didn't listen to her friends who told her to be careful. Suddenly, Lily lost her balance and started to fall. She fell down the hill, and her friends gasped in worry.
When Lily reached the bottom of the hill, she was sad and hurt. Her friends came to help her, but the big strawberry was gone. It had rolled away when Lily fell. Now, no one could enjoy the big strawberry.
The moral of the story is to always listen to your friends and share with them. If Lily had listened to her friends and shared the big strawberry, they all could have enjoyed it together, and she wouldn't have gotten hurt.
