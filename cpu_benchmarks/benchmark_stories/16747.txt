Tim and Mia liked to study crabs at the beach. They had a book with pictures and names of different crabs. They also had a bucket and a net to catch crabs and look at them.
One day, they found a big red crab with long claws. Tim wanted to catch it and put it in the bucket. He said, "Look, Mia, this crab is so big and red. I want to study it. It is the best crab ever."
But Mia also wanted to catch the crab. She said, "No, Tim, I want to study it. It is the most beautiful crab ever."
They both ran after the crab, but the crab was fast and smart. It ran away from them and hid under a rock. Tim and Mia tried to reach for it, but they could not. They started to argue and push each other.
"Stop, Tim, you are hurting me. Let me have the crab."
"No, Mia, you stop. The crab is mine."
They were so busy fighting that they did not see a wave coming. The wave washed over them and soaked them. They also lost their bucket, their net and their book. The crab came out of the rock and scuttled away.
Tim and Mia stopped fighting and looked at each other. They felt sad and sorry. They said, "We are sorry, Tim. We are sorry, Mia. We were too competitive. We should have shared the crab and studied it together."
They hugged and made up. They decided to look for another crab, but this time, they would work as a team. They also hoped to find their bucket, their net and their book. They learned a lesson from the crab.
