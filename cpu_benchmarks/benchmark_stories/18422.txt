Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and eat yummy snacks like cookies and fruit. One day, her mom gave her a special herb to smell. It smelled so good, like flowers in the garden.
Lily's mom told her that the herb was very helpful for when she felt sick. She must remember to smell it when she had a runny nose or a cough. Lily loved her mom's helpful advice and put the herb in her pocket.
Days went by and Lily forgot about the herb. One day, she felt sick and had a runny nose. She remembered her mom's words and found the herb in her pocket. She smelled it and felt better right away. From then on, she always remembered to keep the helpful herb with her.
