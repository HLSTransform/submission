The sea sparkled as a little boy ran up to it. He was dressed in a bright blue shirt and shorts and had a fishing net in his small hand. He looked out to the shore, he couldn't help grinning.
"Look at all the different creatures here," the little boy said to his mum.
Mum smiled and said "yes, there are lots of interesting animals, but you must be careful. Remember not to tease any of the animals, even if they are really clever."
The little boy thought for a moment about what his mum had said and then nodded. He ran down to the shore and started looking for animals. He saw many crabs and fishes, crabs were particularly fun to find as they liked to hide under rocks. 
After a while, the little boy heard a noise and turned around. A seagull had landed close by, it's bright white feathers shining in the sun. The little boy thought it was so clever and he couldn't help teasing it just a little bit. 
He waved to the seagull and called out to it. The seagull flapped it's wings and flew away. The little boy laughed and watched it until it was out of sight. 
He was glad that his mum had reminded him not to tease the animals too much. He felt very clever.
