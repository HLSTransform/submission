Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside with his friends. One day, Timmy found a cricket hopping around in the grass. The cricket was so cool because it had long legs and made a chirping sound. 
Timmy wanted to show his friends the cricket, so he asked his mom if he could print a picture of it. His mom helped him find a picture of a cricket on the computer and they printed it out. Timmy was so excited to show his friends the picture of the cool cricket. 
When Timmy showed his friends the picture, they all thought it was really cool too. They decided to go outside and try to find more crickets. Timmy was happy to have such cool friends to play with. The end.
