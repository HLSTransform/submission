Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved muffins! One day, she went to the bakery to buy a muffin. She saw a wealthy lady buying lots of muffins. 
Lily said, "Wow, you have so many muffins! Can I have one, please?" 
The wealthy lady replied, "No, I need all of them for myself." 
Lily felt sad and walked away. As she was walking, she saw a homeless man sitting on the street. He looked hungry. She thought of the muffin and decided to share it with him. 
She squeezed the muffin in half and gave one half to the homeless man. He smiled and said, "Thank you, little girl. You are very kind." 
Lily felt happy and learned that sharing is more important than being wealthy.
