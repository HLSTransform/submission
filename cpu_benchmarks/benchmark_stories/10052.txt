Lily was a normal child who liked to talk a lot. She talked to her mom, her dad, her toys, and her friends. She talked about what she saw, what she felt, and what she wanted. She talked in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a big dog with a red collar. She wanted to talk to the dog, so she ran to it and said, "Hi, dog! What is your name? Do you like to play?"
The dog looked at Lily and barked. He did not talk like Lily. He talked like a dog. Lily was confused. She asked, "Why don't you talk like me? Can you understand me?"
The dog wagged his tail and licked Lily's face. He did not understand Lily, but he liked her. He wanted to play with her. Lily giggled and hugged the dog. She said, "You are a nice dog. I like you too. Let's play!"
Lily and the dog played in the park. They ran, they jumped, and they rolled on the grass. Lily's mom watched them and smiled. She was happy that Lily made a new friend. She said, "Lily, you are a good child. You can talk to anyone and make them happy."
