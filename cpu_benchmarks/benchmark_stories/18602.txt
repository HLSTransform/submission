Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very excited because she was going to have a sleepover with her friend, Emma. Lily's mommy helped her lay out a sheet on the floor for them to sleep on. They had pillows and blankets too. 
Lily and Emma stayed up late telling stories and giggling. They were having so much fun! When it was time to go to sleep, they snuggled under the blankets and closed their eyes. 
The next morning, Lily's mommy came in and saw that they had slept on the sheet. She was happy that they had such a good time together. Lily and Emma were already awake and ready for breakfast. They couldn't wait to have pancakes and syrup!
