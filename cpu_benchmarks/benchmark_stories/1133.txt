Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to collect things. He would go around his house every day looking for something special to keep.
One day, he found a very special place. It was a very serious place with lots of things to collect. He spent lots of time there searching for treasures.
He found a shiny rock, feathers, and many other things. He put them all in a bag and took them home. He was so happy with all the things he collected.
The little boy kept collecting from the serious place. He added so many things to his bag that it became heavy to carry. He would go back over and over again, always finding something new to take home.
He eventually made so many trips to the serious place that all his special things filled up his room.
The end.
