One day, a little girl named Lily went outside to play. She saw a big tree with lots of ash under it. Lily felt happy and started to skip around the tree. She liked to play in the ash because it was soft and fun.
As Lily skipped, she saw a small bird on the ground. The bird was sad because it could not fly. Lily wanted to help the bird, so she picked it up and put it in a soft nest in the tree. The bird was grateful and chirped a happy song.
Lily went home and told her mom about the bird. Her mom was proud of her for helping the bird. Lily felt good and knew she had a new friend in the little bird. She went outside every day to see the bird and skip around the big tree with ash.
