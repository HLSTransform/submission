One day, a dolphin named Bob was swimming in the sea. He saw a boat with a man. The man was eating something that looked good. Bob swam closer and saw that it was spicy food. The man saw Bob and gave him a big smile. Bob nodded his head and smiled back.
The man had an idea. He thought that if he gave Bob some of the spicy food, they could be friends. He held out the food for Bob to eat. Bob was happy to try the food, but he did not know that it was spicy. He took a bite and his mouth started to feel hot.
Bob did not like the spicy food. It was too hot for him. He tried to swim away, but the man did not want Bob to leave. He tried to give Bob more spicy food, but Bob did not want it. He wanted to go back to his family. The man did not let Bob go, and Bob was sad.
