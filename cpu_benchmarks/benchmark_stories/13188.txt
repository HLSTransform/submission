The waves were crashing against the shore and the tide was coming in. John and his dog, Rover, went running to the beach to enjoy the day. The sand was hot and the sun was shining. 
John and Rover played in the waves. John loved feeling the coolness of the water as it touched his toes. He kicked and splashed around with his dog. Rover always made John laugh when he got dizzy from spinning and running around in circles.
John and Rover collected stones and shells. They laughed as they found the prettiest ones to take home. They threw sticks in the water and had a race to see who could fetch them back first.
When the sun was setting, they were sad to leave the beach. But they filled their bags with the wonderful treasures they collected, knowing they could come back and enjoy the beach again.
