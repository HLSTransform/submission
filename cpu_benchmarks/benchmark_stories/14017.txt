One day, a small cat named Kitty went for a walk. She saw a shower outside. It was very big and shiny. Kitty wanted to play in the water. She jumped in and got all wet. She was having lots of fun.
Kitty saw a big button near the shower. It said "reverse". She did not know what it meant. Kitty was very curious. She asked a bird, "What does 'reverse' mean?" The bird said, "I don't know, let's find out!"
Kitty pushed the button. The water started to go back up into the shower. Kitty was scared. She tried to get out, but the water pulled her up too. The bird tried to help, but it was too late. Kitty went up, up, up, and never came back down.
