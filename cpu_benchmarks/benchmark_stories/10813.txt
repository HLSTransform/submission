Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite alarm clock that she loved to play with. One day, Lily's mom said, "Lily, it's time to nap." But Lily didn't want to nap. She wanted to play with her alarm clock.
Lily's mom said, "Please nap, Lily. You need your rest." But Lily was troubled. She didn't want to nap. She wanted to play. So, Lily snuck out of bed and played with her alarm clock. She turned the alarm on and off, and it made a loud noise.
Suddenly, Lily's mom came back into the room and saw that Lily wasn't napping. She was playing with her alarm clock. Lily's mom was very angry and took the alarm clock away. Lily was sad and cried. She didn't understand why her mom was so upset. From that day on, Lily knew that she had to nap when her mom said so, or she would get into trouble.
