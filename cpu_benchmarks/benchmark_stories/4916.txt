Once there was a boy named Mark. Mark loved adventure. He was always looking for something fun to do.
One day, Mark went to the park. He saw a melon on the ground. He picked up the melon and looked at it closely.
Mark was curious. He wanted to find out what was inside. So he decided to replace the melon’s green skin with something else. He looked around and found some cute stickers. He carefully stuck them on the melon to make it look even more charming.
Mark took the melon home with him and showed his mom. Mom was very surprised. She asked Mark what he was going to do with the melon. Mark replied "I’m going to open it and eat what's inside!" Mom smiled and said, "That sounds like fun! Let me help you."
So Mark and his mom opened the melon. Inside, they found some delicious, juicy melon. They both had fun eating the melon together. Mark thought it was the best adventure ever!
