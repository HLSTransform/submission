Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a picture of her family that she loved very much. One day, her friend Timmy came over to play. Timmy saw the picture and said he liked it a lot. Lily wanted to be nice, so she let Timmy borrow the picture for a little while. 
But when Timmy brought the picture back, Lily noticed that it was a little weak. The frame was broken and the picture looked like it had been bent. Lily felt sad because she loved the picture so much. She told Timmy what had happened and he said he was sorry. Timmy promised to be more careful next time he borrowed something.
