Once upon a time, there was a poor little mouse named Timmy. Timmy lived in a small hole in the wall of a big house. Every day, Timmy would go outside to find a snack to eat.
One day, while Timmy was looking for a snack, he saw a big piece of cheese on a table. Timmy was so hungry that he couldn't resist the cheese. He climbed up onto the table and started to eat the cheese.
Suddenly, the owner of the house came into the room and saw Timmy eating the cheese. The owner picked up a broom and said, "You naughty mouse! You shouldn't steal my snack!" Timmy was so scared that he bowed his head and ran back to his hole.
From that day on, Timmy was too scared to leave his hole and find food. He became weaker and weaker until one day he passed away from hunger. The end.
