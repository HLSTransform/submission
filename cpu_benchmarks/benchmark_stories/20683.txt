Once upon a time there was a cold tiger. He was really thirsty, so he went to the lake to drink some water. He jumped in and started to drink, but after a few minutes he saw something moving in the water. It was a big fish! The tiger got scared and jumped out of the lake. 
He ran away and hid behind a big tree. He was so scared that he couldn't move. But after a few minutes he saw something else. It was a big jug of milk! The tiger was so happy that he ran over and started to drink it. He drank and drank until the jug was empty.
The tiger was happy and content. He thanked the milk for giving him a drink. Now he was no longer thirsty, and he wasn't cold anymore. The tiger thanked the milk and went home, happy and content. 
The tiger never forgot the lesson he learned - if you are thirsty, there is always something to drink.
