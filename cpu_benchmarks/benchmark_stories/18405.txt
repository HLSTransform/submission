Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and drink milk. One day, Lily's mom gave her a glass of milk and told her to be careful because it was fragile. 
Lily was very careful and held the glass of milk with both hands. She walked slowly and didn't want to spill any milk. Her cat, Mittens, followed her everywhere she went. 
Lily decided to play with her dolls outside, but Mittens still followed her. She sat down in the grass and placed the glass of milk next to her. Mittens jumped on her lap and Lily hugged him. Suddenly, Mittens accidentally knocked over the glass of milk. 
Lily was sad because she loved her milk, but she knew it was just an accident. She forgave Mittens and they continued to play together. From that day on, Lily always made sure to put her milk in a safe place and Mittens learned to be more careful.
