Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play with their toys in the living room. One day, they find a clear cup on the table. It is shiny and pretty.
"Look, a cup!" Sara says. "I want it!"
"No, I want it!" Tom says. "It is mine!"
They both grab the cup and pull hard. The cup breaks into pieces. They hear a loud noise. Mom comes into the living room.
"What happened?" Mom asks. "Who broke the cup?"
Sara and Tom are scared. They do not want to get in trouble.
"It was not me!" Sara says. She points at Tom. "He did it!"
"It was not me!" Tom says. He points at Sara. "She did it!"
Mom looks at them. She is angry and sad. She knows they are lying.
"That is not true!" Mom says. "You both broke the cup! You both lied to me! That is very bad!"
Sara and Tom feel sorry. They know they did wrong.
"We are sorry, Mom," they say. "We will not lie again. We will share our toys."
Mom hugs them. She is still angry, but she loves them.
"I forgive you, but you have to clean up the mess," she says. "And you have to learn to be honest and kind. Lying is not good. It hurts people and yourself."
Sara and Tom nod. They help Mom clean up the broken cup. They learn their lesson. They do not lie anymore. They play nicely with each other. They are happy.
