Tom likes to play golf with his dad. They go to a big field with holes and flags. Tom has a small stick and a white ball. His dad has a big stick and a white ball. They hit the balls with the sticks and try to get them in the holes.
One day, they go to play golf, but there is a problem. A man at the gate says they have to pay money to play. Tom's dad does not have money. He forgot his wallet at home. He says sorry to Tom and the man. He says they have to go back and get the money.
Tom is upset. He wants to play golf with his dad. He does not want to go back. He cries and stamps his feet. He says it is not fair. His dad tries to calm him down. He says they can come back another day. He says they can do something else fun.
Tom does not listen. He runs away from his dad. He sees a golf cart. He thinks it is a toy. He gets in and pushes a button. The golf cart starts to move. Tom is scared. He does not know how to stop it. He screams for his dad.
His dad hears him and runs after him. He catches up with the golf cart and jumps in. He stops the cart and hugs Tom. He says he is glad he is safe. He says he is sorry he ran away. He says he is sorry he made him upset. He says he loves him.
Tom says he is sorry too. He says he loves him too. He says he does not need to play golf. He says he just wants to be with him. They hug and smile. They go back to the gate and say sorry to the man. The man is nice. He says they can play golf for free. He says he likes to see happy dads and sons. Tom and his dad thank him and go to play golf. They have a lot of fun.
