Tim and Liz are brother and sister. They like to play in their room after dinner. They have many toys and books and a lamp that makes the room bright.
One night, Tim wants to play with a train that Liz is holding. He says, "Give me the train, Liz. It is my turn to play with it." Liz says, "No, Tim. I am not done with it. You can play with something else." Tim gets angry and tries to grab the train from Liz. Liz holds on to the train and says, "Stop, Tim. You are hurting me."
Mom hears them fighting and comes to their room. She sees Tim and Liz pulling the train and yelling at each other. She says, "What is going on here? Why are you not sharing the train?" Tim and Liz both say, "It is mine. I want to play with it." Mom says, "That is not nice. You should yield to each other and take turns. Sharing is caring. If you keep fighting, you will break the train and make each other sad."
Tim and Liz look at the train and see that it is already bent and scratched. They feel sorry and ashamed. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were selfish and mean. We will share the train and play nicely." Mom says, "That is good. I am proud of you. Now, it is time to get ready for bed. You are both sleepy and need to rest." She turns off the lamp and gives them a hug and a kiss. Tim and Liz say, "Good night, Mom. We love you." They snuggle in their beds and fall asleep. They dream of happy train rides and adventures.
