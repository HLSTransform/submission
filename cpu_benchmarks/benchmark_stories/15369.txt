Once there was a young boy who wanted to pick some fruit in the garden. He noticed a big melon and wanted to mention it to his mom. He thought it was the best melon he had ever seen. He showed his mom the melon and she gave him a big hug. She told him that he could take the melon home. The young boy was so excited! He carefully carried the melon all the way home. When he arrived, he was so proud that he asked his mom to cut it open so everyone could have some. She happily obliged and it was the most delicious melon they had ever tasted. It was a special memory for the young boy, and he would always treasure it!
