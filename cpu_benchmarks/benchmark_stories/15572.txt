Lily loved to play in the garden. She liked to look at the flowers and the bugs and the birds. One day, she saw something shiny in the grass. She went closer and saw a tiny fairy with wings. The fairy was hurt and could not fly.
"Hello, fairy," Lily said. "Are you okay?"
The fairy looked at Lily and smiled. "Hello, little girl," she said. "I am not okay. I fell from the sky and hurt my wing. Can you help me?"
Lily nodded. She picked up the fairy gently and put her in her hand. She ran to the house and showed her mom. "Mom, look! I found a fairy in the garden. She needs help."
Mom was surprised. She had never seen a fairy before. She took the fairy and wrapped her wing with a band-aid. She gave her some water and honey. "There you go, fairy," she said. "You will be better soon. You can stay with us until you can fly again."
The fairy thanked mom and Lily. She felt safe and happy. She told them stories about the sky and the stars and the other fairies. Lily and mom listened and smiled. They became friends with the fairy. They started to believe in magic.
