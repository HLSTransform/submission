Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to do creative things like painting and drawing. One day, she was playing with her friend, Timmy. Timmy said, "Lily, what can you do with your nose?" 
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I can wiggle it!" She wiggled her nose and Timmy laughed. 
Then, Timmy said, "Let's do something creative! How about we draw pictures of our favorite animals?" 
Lily loved that idea and they spent the rest of the afternoon drawing pictures of lions, elephants, and monkeys. When they were finished, they showed their pictures to each other and said, "Wow, you're so creative!" 
Lily and Timmy had so much fun that day, and from then on, they did creative things together all the time.
