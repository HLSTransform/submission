Once upon a time, there was a big bear. He liked to run and play all day. But one day, his muscle hurt so he had to rest. The bear lay down on the grass and closed his eyes. He felt very tired and his muscle was hard. He stayed there for a long time until he felt better. Then he got up and went to play again. The bear learned that sometimes it's good to rest when your muscle hurts.
