Once there was a little girl. She was only three years old. One day, the little girl went for a walk in the park. While she was there, she saw something very surprising: a big, long machine.
The little girl was amazed. She wanted to know what the machine did. She looked around, but she couldn't see anyone who could help her. Still, she was very curious.
Suddenly, the machine started to move. The little girl was so surprised that she stepped back. Then she saw that the machine was picking up leaves and putting them in a big basket.
The little girl smiled. She was glad that she got to see the long machine do its job. She was happy to have such a cool experience.
