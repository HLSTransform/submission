John was walking. He felt tired and hungry. But he also was very happy, because he knew what he was looking for. It was a hairy plant. Suddenly he saw it. He stopped and squealed with delight. 
He rushed to the plant, but when he got there, he stopped. He looked angry. "I hate this plant!" he shouted. 
John's mom saw what happened and came over. "What's wrong, sweetie?" she asked. 
John pointed at the plant. "I hate it! It's too hairy!" he said, frowning. 
Mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, John. I'll help you. We can trim the hair and make this plant lovely. Together we can make it look better." 
John grinned and said, "Okay, mom." Together they trimmed the hair and the plant looked much better. John smiled, happy to have made a new friend.
