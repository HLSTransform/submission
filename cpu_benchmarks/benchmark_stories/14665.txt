Once upon a time there was a tough girl called Daisy. Daisy loved fashion, but she was so clumsy that she kept slipping.
One day, Daisy saw a really pretty dress in a shop window. It was bright blue with yellow polka dots. Daisy wanted it so badly, but she knew if she tried it on she would just slip again.
Suddenly, Daisy had an idea. She decided to be really careful and take tiny, slow steps so she would stay on her feet. She moved ever-so-slowly across the shop and tried on the dress.
It was perfect! Daisy smiled and felt really proud of herself. From then on, no matter how tough things were, Daisy never slipped again.
