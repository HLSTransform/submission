Once upon a time, there was a group of animal friends. They loved to play together and have fun. One day, they decided to go on an adventure in the forest. 
As they walked, they came across a little bird who was lost. The group of friends felt sad for the bird and decided to help him find his way home. They searched and searched until they found the bird's nest. 
The bird was so happy and grateful that he laughed and sang a beautiful song for his new friends. The group of friends felt proud and happy that they could help the little bird. 
From that day on, the little bird became a loyal friend to the group. They all learned that helping others can bring joy and happiness to everyone.
