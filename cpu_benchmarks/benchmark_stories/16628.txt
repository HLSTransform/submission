Tim and Sam love to play with their toy trains. They have many trains of different colors and sizes. They like to make tracks on the floor and pretend they are driving the trains.
One day, Tim and Sam find a big box in the garage. It has a picture of a train on it. They open the box and see a shiny new train. It is red and black and has a big engine. It also has a remote control that can make the train go fast or slow, or make sounds.
Tim and Sam are very happy. They take the train and the remote control to the living room. They clear some space on the floor and set up the train on a track. They turn on the remote control and press a button. The train starts to move. It makes a loud whistle sound and a puff of smoke. Tim and Sam laugh and clap.
They take turns driving the train. They make it go around the track, over a bridge, and through a tunnel. They make it stop and start, and change directions. They have a lot of fun.
But then, the train starts to slow down. It makes a weak sound and stops. Tim and Sam look at the remote control. It has a red light that says "low battery". They need to supply more power to the train. They look for more batteries, but they cannot find any. They are sad.
They decide to play with their other trains. They put the new train on a shelf and take out their old trains. They make new tracks and drive their old trains. They are quiet, but they still have fun. They hope they can find more batteries soon and play with their new train again. They love their trains.
