Lily and Ben like to collect rocks. They go to the park and look for rocks that are shiny, smooth, or have funny shapes. They put the rocks in their pockets or in a bag. They are happy when they find a new rock.
One day, they meet a boy named Sam at the park. Sam has a big box of toys. He has cars, trucks, dolls, and balls. He sees Lily and Ben with their rocks and laughs.
"Rocks are boring," he says. "They have no value. You can't play with them. You should get some real toys like mine. They are fun and colorful."
Lily and Ben feel sad. They like their rocks. They think their rocks have value. They think their rocks are fun and beautiful.
They say to Sam, "We don't want your toys. We like our rocks. They are not boring. They have value to us. We can play with them. We can make patterns, or pretend they are animals, or use them as treasure. They are our friends."
Sam does not understand. He thinks Lily and Ben are silly. He shrugs and goes back to his toys.
Lily and Ben smile at each other. They hold their rocks tight. They are happy with their collection. They think their rocks are the best.
