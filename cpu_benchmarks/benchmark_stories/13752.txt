Sam and Mia were playing pirates in the garden. They had a big box for a ship, a stick for a sword and a map for treasure. The map had a red X on it and some lines and dots.
"Let's follow the map and find the treasure!" Sam said. He held the map in his hand and looked around. "We need to go past the tree, over the bridge and under the slide."
"Okay, captain!" Mia said. She picked up her sword and followed Sam. They ran past the tree, over the bridge and under the slide. They saw a huge pile of leaves.
"Maybe the treasure is under the leaves!" Sam said. He dropped the map and started to dig with his hands. Mia helped him.
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar. They looked up and saw a big dog standing over them. The dog had the map in his mouth. He was wagging his tail and barking.
"Hey, that's our map!" Sam shouted. "Give it back!"
The dog did not reply. He ran away with the map, leaving Sam and Mia in the pile of leaves.
"Come back, you naughty dog!" Mia cried. "We need our map!"
But the dog was gone. Sam and Mia were sad. They had lost their map and their treasure.
"Maybe we can make another map," Sam said. He tried to cheer up Mia.
"Or maybe we can find another treasure," Mia said. She smiled at Sam.
They got up and dusted off the leaves. They decided to keep playing pirates. They had fun, even without the map.
