Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her shiny crystal. One day, Lily's brother came into her room and accidentally knocked over her crystal. It fell to the ground and snapped into two pieces. 
Lily was very upset and started to cry. Her brother felt bad and said, "I'm sorry Lily, I didn't mean to break your crystal." 
Lily wiped away her tears and said, "It's okay, but it was noisy when it snapped." 
Her brother hugged her and promised to be more careful with her toys in the future. From that day on, Lily learned to be more careful with her special things, including her noisy crystal.
