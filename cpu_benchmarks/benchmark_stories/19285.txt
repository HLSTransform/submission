One day, a little boy went for a walk. He wheeled his toy car. He loved his car as it always made him very happy. He saw a pale orange flower with a stem. He carefully picked it and wheeled his car home.
On the way, he saw an old lady walking on the same path. He wheeled his car to the side and let her pass. She smiled and said, "Thank you, young man!"
The little boy wheeled his car back home and walked into his bedroom. He placed the pale flower on the table, admiring its beauty. His mother saw it when she walked into the room. She filled with joy and said, "What a beautiful flower you got, my boy!" The little boy smiled brightly.
He wheeled his car out of his room, feeling very happy and content. He continued to wheel his car, walking proudly through the streets, feeling so special.
