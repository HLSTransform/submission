One day, a big brown couch was broken. The leg of the couch was not on it. The couch was sad because it could not be used. It wanted to be fixed so people could sit on it again.
A man named Tom saw the broken couch. He wanted to help the couch. Tom knew how to repair things. He thought fixing the couch would be easy. Tom found a new leg for the couch and some tools.
Tom worked hard to repair the couch. He put the new leg on the couch. The couch was happy to be fixed. Now, people could sit on the couch again. The couch and Tom were both happy.
