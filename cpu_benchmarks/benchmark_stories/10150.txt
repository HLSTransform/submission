Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside. One day, he saw a large cloud in the sky.
"Mommy, look! A big cloud!" Timmy said.
"That's a storm cloud, Timmy. We should go inside," his mommy replied.
Timmy was sad because he wanted to play outside. But then, he had an idea.
"Mommy, can we catch the raindrops in a bucket?" Timmy asked.
"Sure, Timmy. That sounds like fun," his mommy said.
Timmy and his mommy went outside with a bucket and caught the raindrops from the storm. Timmy was so happy that he caught the raindrops in his bucket. He couldn't wait for the next storm!
