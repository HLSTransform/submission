Jane loves to spend time in her own garden. There are lots of trees, flowers and insects and she loves to watch them all.
One day Jane found a little bush. She couldn't tell what was inside, so she opened it up. To her surprise, Jane found lots of delicious little berries. She put some of them in a basket and took them home.
At home, Jane cooked all the berries with sugar and cream. She made a delicious dessert that everyone wanted to try.
The next day Jane went back to the bush to find some more strawberries. She spent all day picking them, picking lots of sweet and juicy mine from the bush.
At home, Jane made lots of desserts for her family and friends, who all enjoyed the delicious strawberry dessert. Jane was very happy, and so were all her friends.
