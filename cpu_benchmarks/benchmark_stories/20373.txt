Anna likes to cook with her mom. She helps her mom cut the carrots and stir the soup. She also likes to taste the food and say if it is good or not.
One day, Anna asks her mom, "Mom, what is this?" She points to a big jar on the shelf. It has a label that says "Brain".
Mom looks at the jar and smiles. She says, "That is not for cooking, Anna. That is for learning. It is a brain."
"A brain?" Anna repeats. She is curious. "What is a brain?"
"A brain is a part of your body. It is inside your head. It helps you think and remember and do things. It is very important and very fit."
Anna nods. She wants to have a fit brain too. She says, "How can I make my brain fit, mom?"
Mom hugs her and says, "You can make your brain fit by reading and playing and asking questions and being kind. And by cooking with me, of course."
Anna giggles. She likes to cook with her mom. She says, "Can we cook some brain soup?"
Mom laughs. She says, "No, Anna. We don't cook brain soup. We cook carrot soup. And it is ready. Let's eat."
Anna and mom sit down and enjoy their soup. Anna thinks it is the best soup ever. She thinks her mom is the best cook ever. And she thinks her brain is very fit and happy.
