Once upon a time there was a little boy. He was three years old and his name was Bobby. Bobby was very happy, he loved playing with all his toys. One day he was playing in his room and he saw something shiny. It was a shiny gold coin! Bobby was so excited he thought it was very fancy.
He wanted to show it to his dad, so he went looking for him. But when Bobby went to his dad, his dad just ignored him. Bobby was sad, so he put the gold coin back in his room. He was going to tell his mom all about it.
But when Bobby went to show his mom, she also ignored him. Bobby was very upset, he just wanted someone to be excited about the fancy gold coin with him.
After a few minutes, Bobby calmed down and decided to keep the gold coin for himself. He put the shiny gold coin in his toy box, so he could show it to his friends!
