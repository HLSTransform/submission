Once there was a brave child named Tina. She wanted to go on an adventure to visit a special square. So she put on her red coat and went out the door. 
On the way, she met a friendly bird. The bird chirped, “Where are you going?” 
“I am going to visit a special square,” said Tina bravely. 
The bird said, “I can show you the way. Follow me!” So Tina followed the bird to the square. 
When she arrived, Tina saw a big park and a playground. Her eyes lit up with joy. She ran around and had lots of fun. When it was time to go back home, Tina thanked the bird for showing her the way. 
The bird waved goodbye and said, “Goodbye, brave Tina. I hope you will visit us again!”
Tina smiled and said, “Yes, I will!” Then she waved goodbye and went back home.
