Once upon a time, there was a rich old man. He was very proud of his big thumb. Every day he would race around with it. He liked to be the first one to get everywhere.
One day, he noticed a young boy playing outside. The old man wanted to race the young boy. But, the young boy was much faster. He ran past the old man! The old man tried and tried, but he just couldn't keep up.
The old man was very sad. Then he had an idea. He used his big thumb to help him. He wiggled it back and forth, and that made him go faster. The boy couldn't believe his eyes!
The old man raced past the young boy and won the race. Everyone cheered for the old man. They were amazed at how fast he could go with his big thumb. He was the fastest racer around.
