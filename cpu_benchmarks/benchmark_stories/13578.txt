Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her kitty, Mittens. One day, Lily and Mittens went for a walk in the park. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw a big fire! It was an emergency!
Lily tried to run away, but she saw someone struggling in the fire. It was a puppy! Lily knew she had to help. She ran to the modern fire truck and told the fireman about the puppy. The fireman quickly drove to the fire and saved the puppy.
Lily was so happy that she helped the puppy. She learned that even though emergencies can be scary, it's important to help others who are struggling.
