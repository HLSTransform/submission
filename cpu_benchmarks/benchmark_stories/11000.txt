Anna and Ben love to watch fireworks. They like the big, bright colors and the loud noises. Sometimes they make their own fireworks with paper and crayons. They are very creative.
One day, they find a box of real fireworks in the garage. They are curious and excited. They want to see what they can do with them. They take the box to the backyard and open it.
They see many different kinds of fireworks. Some are small and round, some are long and thin, some have funny shapes and colors. They pick one that looks like a star and light it with a match.
The firework makes a hissing sound and shoots up in the air. Then it explodes with a big bang and a shower of sparks. Anna and Ben clap and cheer. They think it is amazing.
They want to try another one. They pick one that looks like a flower and light it. But this time, something goes wrong. The firework does not fly up. It stays on the ground and spins around. It makes a loud whirring noise and sparks fly everywhere.
Anna and Ben are scared. They run away from the firework. They are too close to it. The sparks burn their clothes and hair. They scream and cry.
Mom and Dad hear the noise and come outside. They see the firework and the smoke and the children. They are angry and worried. They put out the fire and take the children inside. They check their burns and bandage them. They hug them and tell them they are okay.
They also tell them they are very naughty. They should never play with fireworks. They are dangerous and not toys. They should only watch them from far away with grown-ups. They should use their creativity for other things, like drawing or singing or building.
Anna and Ben are sorry. They say they are sorry. They promise they will never play with fireworks again. They learn their lesson. They still love fireworks, but only from a safe distance.
