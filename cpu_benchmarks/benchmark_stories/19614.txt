One day, Mommy and Daddy let the little girl go explore the attic. It was a very scary place. Everything was gloomy and dusty. Suddenly, she heard a noise behind her. She got very scared and started to cry. Mommy and Daddy heard her and came running upstairs. They found her in the attic and said it was okay. They hugged her and promised to keep her safe. So Mommy and Daddy let the girl explore the attic again. This time the girl was brave and looked around at all the boxes and things. After a while, she found something very special and showed it to Mommy and Daddy. Mommy and Daddy smiled and said it was a perfect find for the attic.
