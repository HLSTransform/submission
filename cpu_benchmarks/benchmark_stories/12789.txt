Once there was a little boy name Sam and his father John. One day Sam wanted to go outside and play but had forgotten to bring his helmet. So he asked his dad, "Daddy, can I please store my helmet?"
His father looked at him and said, "No, Sam. You forgot your helmet and we need to be safe!" Sam became impatient and started to cry. He wanted to go and play but felt like it would never happen. 
Then his dad said, "Sometimes bad things happen when we are impatient. We can go and get the helmet right now if we are careful and safe."
John and Sam went to store the helmet and when they came back, Sam was happy and excited to go and play. 
The moral of the story is that we must be patient and act safely when making decisions. Being too impatient can lead to wrong choices and often not getting what you want.
