Once upon a time, there was a big volcano. It was far away from a small town. People in the town knew it was there, but they did not worry. They played and had fun every day.
One day, a man came to the town. He wore an expensive coat. He told the people, "I can stop the volcano from making you shiver." The people did not understand, but they wanted to see what he could do.
The man went to the volcano and talked to it. He said, "Please stop making the people shiver." The volcano listened and stopped being scary. The people were happy and thanked the man. They gave him a big party and everyone danced and laughed.
