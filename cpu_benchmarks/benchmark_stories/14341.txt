Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake cookies with her mommy. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to go outside and play with her friends. Lily went outside and saw her friends drawing with chalk on the sidewalk. She joined in and drew a big black cat. After they finished drawing, they went back inside to bake cookies. Lily's mommy was so happy to see her little girl having fun with her friends and being creative with chalk. The cookies turned out delicious and Lily was so proud of herself for helping her mommy bake them.
