Once upon a time, there was a small boy called Kevin. He was very happy, and loved to play with his toys.
One day, while playing outside, he saw a tire in the garden. He said to himself, "I'm going to win this tire!" It looked so fun and exciting.
He ran as fast as he could and grabbed the tire. He was so happy to have won it! 
But, when he held the tire, he realised it was very fragile. He was a bit scared that it might break. 
Kevin then heard his mum's voice coming from the kitchen, "Be careful with that tire! It looks quite fragile."
Kevin was glad to hear his mum's voice and decided to be extra careful with the tire. He continued to play with it, but he was very careful not to break it. 
He had won the tire and wanted to keep it safe. And happily, he did keep it safe!
