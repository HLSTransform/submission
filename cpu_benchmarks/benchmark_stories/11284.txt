One day, June and her mommy were shopping at the store. June loved shops and often played with the scooters in the store. As she did so, a big man in a dark suit approached June and her mommy. He said to them: "Would you like to join me for dinner tonight? I can offer you a free scooter as a present." June and her mommy were surprised. They looked at each other and smiled. June was so excited!
Later that night, June's mommy and the big man in a dark suit went out for dinner. June stayed home, but she did get to keep the scooter. She ran around the house, scooting in happiness. 
When they came back, the big man said to June: "You are a very brave girl. I wanted to offer you something special and I think this scooter is perfect!" June was so happy and thanked the man. 
From then onward, the scooter was June's favourite toy. She enjoyed riding it around the house and in the park with her friends. June was so happy the big man in a dark suit had offered her the scooter!
