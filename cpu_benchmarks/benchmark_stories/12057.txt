Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop and play in the grass. One day, Benny saw some bubbles floating high in the air. He wanted to catch them! So, he hopped and hopped, trying to reach the bubbles. But they were too high. 
Benny was sad, but then he had an idea. He found a big stick and started to wave it around. Suddenly, he made a big bubble! It was so big and shiny. Benny was happy again. He hopped around with his big bubble, feeling proud of himself. 
As the sun started to set, Benny's bubble popped. But he didn't mind. He knew he could always make more bubbles tomorrow. Benny hopped back to his burrow, feeling tired but happy.
