Mum had a new table. It was soft and safe. Mum looked at it and smiled.
Mum said it was time to pay for the table. She gave the man some money. He said thank you and gave her a big hug. 
Mum and the little girl put their things on the table. They were so happy. They played with their toys and laughed together.
Mum said the table made them feel safe. Mum said it was their special table. 
The little girl liked to play with her toys at the safe table. Every day when she came home she went straight to it. She was happy to have such a nice safe table.
