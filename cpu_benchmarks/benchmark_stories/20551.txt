Once upon a time there were two friends. They were walking in the park when they heard a loud scream. They were scared and started to cry. They looked up into the sky and saw the earth. It was heavy because it was so big.
They were scared so they grabbed each other's hands and ran quickly back to their house. When they got there they hugged each other and it made them feel safe.
The next day they decided to go back to the park but they were still scared. This time they saw a little bird and it was chirping happily. They stopped and looked at it and bravely said hello. The bird flew away but it made the children feel better.
From then on, they weren't scared of the earth anymore and every time they wanted to be brave, they thought of the little bird.
