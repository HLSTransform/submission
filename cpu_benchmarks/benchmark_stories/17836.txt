Once there was a little girl called Lizzie. She liked to explore. One day she went exploring in a big chamber. She soon noticed a spicy smell. 
Curious, she went further inside and noticed a pinch on her arm. It was a tiny ant! She laughed and held the ant in her hand. 
The ant was so small. Suddenly Lizzie felt something burning her hand. It was spicy! She realized the ant had left a spicy liquid behind. Lizzie quickly washed away the pinch and decided never to pick up ants in the chamber again.
