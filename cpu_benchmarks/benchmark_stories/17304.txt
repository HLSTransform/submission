Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to pretend she was a princess and lived in a big castle. One day, Lily and her friends decided to build a castle out of blocks. They used all different colors and shapes to make it look modern.
As they were playing, Lily's little brother came and knocked down their building. Everyone was sad and wanted to give up. But Lily said, "Let's pretend our castle is still standing and we are the bravest knights protecting it!" So they continued to play and imagine their castle was still there.
The moral of the story is that even when things don't go as planned, we can still use our imagination and pretend to make things better.
