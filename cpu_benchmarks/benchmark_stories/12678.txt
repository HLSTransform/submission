Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Coco. Coco was very hungry and wanted to eat a big meal. She went to her garden to find some carrots, but they were all gone.
Suddenly, Coco heard a loud noise. She felt nervous and scared. She imagined that a big monster was coming to eat her. She ran back to her house as fast as she could.
When she got there, she saw that her friend, a big bear named Benny, was waiting for her. Benny had eaten all of the carrots in the garden. Coco was mad at first, but then she remembered that she had some extra carrots in her fridge. She shared them with Benny and they had a big meal together. From that day on, they made sure to share their food and never let their hunger make them nervous again.
