Once upon a time, there was a happy ball. The ball was red and round, and it loved to roll around. One day, the ball met a mean cat who made a threat to pop it. The ball was scared and tried to roll away, but the cat was too fast. Just when the cat was about to catch the ball, a perfect boy came and scared the cat away. The boy picked up the ball and rolled it back to its home. From that day on, the ball was grateful to the perfect boy who saved it from the threat of the mean cat.
