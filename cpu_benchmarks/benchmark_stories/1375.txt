Once upon a time there was a little girl who was shy. Her name was Pepper. Every morning she went to the park to play. Today she saw a big lion there who was sleeping. Pepper was scared but she stayed very still.
The lion began to yawn, a long and tired yawn. Pepper was so curious. She had never seen a lion before, much less one that was yawning. She was brave and started to laugh.
The lion opened her eyes and saw little Pepper there. Pepper was so scared that she ran away, but the lion just stretched and went back to sleep. Pepper was surprised, she had thought the lion would be mad but she just went back to sleep.
Pepper was happy and laughed all the way back home. She still remembered the lion's yawn and smiled as she thought about it. She knew the lion was very tired, but also very kind.
