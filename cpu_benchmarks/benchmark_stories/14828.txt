Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to slide and swing and run. Lily had a big red boot that she brought from home. She liked to fill it with sand and make shapes.
"Can I play with your boot, Lily?" Ben asked. He wanted to make a sand castle.
"No, it is mine!" Lily said. She hugged the boot and ran away. Ben felt sad and angry. He thought Lily was naughty.
Lily saw a big puddle near the fence. She wanted to splash in it with her boot. She put the boot on her foot and jumped in the puddle. But the boot was too big and it fell off. The puddle was deep and muddy. Lily could not see her boot.
"Help, help!" Lily cried. She was scared and wet. She wanted her boot back.
Ben heard Lily and ran to her. He saw the boot in the puddle. He reached in and pulled it out. He gave it to Lily.
"Thank you, Ben!" Lily said. She was happy and sorry. She realized she was naughty.
"I'm sorry, Ben. I should have shared my boot with you. Do you want to play with it now?" Lily asked.
"Yes, please. And I have a blue hat we can share too. Let's be friends!" Ben said.
They smiled and hugged. They shared the boot and the hat and played together. They had fun and learned to share.
