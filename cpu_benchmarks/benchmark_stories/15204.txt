Once upon a time, there was a big maze in a park. The maze had many paths, and it was fun to play in. One day, two friends named Tim and Sue went to the park to play in the maze.
Inside the maze, they found a big, icy puddle. They liked the icy puddle because it was shiny and fun to slide on. Tim and Sue played on the icy puddle, laughing and having a great time.
After a while, they found a big box of toys in the maze. There were cars, dolls, and balls. Tim and Sue decided to share the toys with each other. They played with the toys and had a lot of fun in the maze. Sharing made them happy, and they became the best of friends.
