Once upon a time, there was a big, wild jungle. In the jungle, there was a monkey who loved to jump from tree to tree. One day, the monkey saw a vendor selling bananas. The monkey loved bananas, so he went to the vendor and asked for one. The vendor gave the monkey a banana, and the monkey was very happy. He ate the banana and then continued to jump from tree to tree, feeling very satisfied. The end.
