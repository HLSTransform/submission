Once upon a time, there was a big room with a fireplace. It was a nice place where a family lived. They liked to sit near the fireplace and feel warm.
One day, a graceful cat came to the room. The cat was very pretty and liked to play. The family loved the cat and they played together all day.
Then, the cat saw a toy near the fireplace. The cat jumped to get the toy but started to fall. The family saw the cat fall and helped it. They moved the toy away from the fireplace. Now, the cat and the family played safe and had fun.
