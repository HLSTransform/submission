Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom had done something wrong and he was feeling guilty. He knew he should tell his mum.
So Tom went to his mum and said, "Mum, I did something wrong. I feel so guilty!" His mum said, "What happened, Tom?"
Tom said, "I separated my brother's toy car and now they cannot play with it. I'm so sorry!" His mum opened her mouth and said, "It's okay, Tom. You can try and fix it."
Tom was so relieved and he went to find his brother. He said, "I'm sorry, I separated your toy car. I will try and fix it." His brother said, "It's okay, Tom. I'm not mad." 
Tom felt happier and went to find his mum. He said, "Thanks for understanding, Mum." His mum said, "That's okay, Tom. I'm glad you told me the truth." 
Tom was very glad he told his mum the truth. He knew it was better than keeping it a secret and feeling guilty.
