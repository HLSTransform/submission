Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars all day long. One day, Timmy's dad took him to the gas station to fill up their car with fuel. Timmy saw the big gas pump and was amazed. He asked his dad what it was and his dad mentioned that it was where they get the car's fuel from. 
Suddenly, Timmy saw a scary spider crawling on the ground. He was so scared that he ran to his dad and hugged him tightly. His dad picked him up and showed him that the spider was just a tiny one and wouldn't hurt him. Timmy felt much better and they went back home. From that day on, Timmy always remembered the fuel pump and the scary spider at the gas station.
