Once upon a time there was a kind old man with a white cloth in his hand. The old man was walking down a path and he saw a small, young boy. The old man asked the boy, "Do you know what this cloth is for?"
The boy nodded his head and said, "Yes sir. It is to help lift things up." 
The old man smiled and replied, "That's right. Now, can you tell me why itâ€™s important to help lift other things?" 
"No, I'm sorry," the boy replied, shaking his head. 
The old man smiled again. "That is okay - I can show you. Look around you and find a small, open box."
The boy did as he was asked and he soon found a small, open box on the side of the path. He brought it to the old man, who smiled and said, "Now watch; with my cloth, I will lift up this box." 
The old man carefully put the cloth on the ground and then used it to lift up the box with ease.
The old man said, "You see, when we give a helping hand to others, it can not only make their work easier, but it can make us feel happier too."
The boy thanked the old man for his lesson, then smiled, feeling much wiser than before.
