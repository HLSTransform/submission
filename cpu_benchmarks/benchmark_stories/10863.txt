Once upon a time, there was a cute puppy. His name was Max. Max was very adorable. He loved to play with his toys and run around in the grass. One day, Max's owner took him to the park to play. 
At the park, Max saw a new friend. It was a little girl named Lily. Lily was shy and didn't know Max. Max's owner decided to introduce Max to Lily. Max was very happy to meet Lily. 
They played together and had fun. But then, Max accidentally bit Lily's hand while playing. Lily cried out in pain. Max felt bad and licked her hand to say sorry. From that day on, Max and Lily became best friends and played together every day at the park.
