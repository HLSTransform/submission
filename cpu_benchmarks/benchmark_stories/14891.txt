Once upon a time there was a nice bear called Bob. He had big fluffy ears and a warm, cuddly fur. One day Bob was walking through a forest, when he saw a rabbit on her shoulder. 
Bob said to the rabbit, "Hi, Rabbit! Where are you going?"
The rabbit replied, "I'm going to my friends' house to give them a nice surprise".
Bob replied, "Can I come with you?"
The Rabbit said, "Sure! Jump on my shoulder and I will give you a ride".
So Bob jumped onto the Rabbit's shoulder and they set off, running through the forest until they arrived at their destination. As they arrived, Bob could see a bright yellow bird, a big gray elephant, and a fuzzy white rabbit all waiting at the door. 
The rabbit hopped off Bob's shoulder and proudly presented her friends with a basket of yummy treats. Everyone smiled and hugged the rabbit, thanking her for her wonderful gift.
Bob smiled too and said, "Nice job, Rabbit! I'm sure your friends really appreciate the nice surprise".
