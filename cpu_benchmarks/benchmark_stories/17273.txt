Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very restless and couldn't sleep at night. One night, she went to the fridge to get a snack. But she saw something strange. The fridge was dressed up in a funny costume! 
Lily was surprised and asked the fridge, "Why are you dressed up like that?" 
The fridge replied, "I am going to a party tonight. Do you want to come with me?" 
Lily was excited and said, "Yes, please!" She quickly got dressed and they went to the party together. They had so much fun dancing and eating yummy food. When it was time to go home, Lily said, "Thank you for taking me to the party, fridge. You are the best friend ever!" 
From that night on, Lily was never restless again. She knew that she had a special friend in the fridge who would always be there for her.
