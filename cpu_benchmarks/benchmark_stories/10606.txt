Once upon a time, there was a boy named Thomas. One day, Thomas decided to go outside to play. Before going out, he looked out the window to observe the weather. It was a sunny day and Thomas was very happy. 
He went outside and started to play. Suddenly, something caught his eye. He saw dark grey clouds and something fluttering in the wind. He became fearful and wanted to go back inside. 
Thomas asked his mom if he could come back inside and she said no. She told him she wanted him to stay outside, so she could do the laundry. 
Thomas became angry and started to cry. He yelled at his mom, "I'm scared of the weather! Please let me come inside!" 
But his mom didn't listen and he stayed outside all alone, feeling very sad and fearful. 
The dark clouds moved ever closer and all Thomas could do was cry and watch in fear as it started to rain. He had no shelter and his sad cries were the only thing that filled the air. 
The End.
