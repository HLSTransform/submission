Once upon a time, there was a cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to play with yarn. She would roll it, chase it, and carry it around in her mouth. One day, Kitty found a very weak yarn. It was very thin and not strong at all. But Kitty still wanted to play with it.
Kitty's friend, Doggy, saw her playing with the weak yarn. Doggy told Kitty that she should not play with the weak yarn because it could break. But Kitty loved the yarn so much, she would not listen. Kitty said, "I insist on playing with my yarn!"
Doggy was worried for Kitty. He thought of a way to help her. He found some strong yarn and brought it to Kitty. He showed her how much better it was to play with the strong yarn. Kitty saw how fun it was and decided to play with the strong yarn instead.
Now, Kitty and Doggy play together with the strong yarn. They both have lots of fun and the yarn does not break. Kitty is happy that Doggy helped her find a better yarn to play with. And they lived happily ever after.
