Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around. One day, she saw her friend Timmy eating lots of junk food. 
"Lily, do you want some candy?" Timmy asked.
"No thank you, Timmy. My mommy says too much junk food can make you sick," Lily replied.
Timmy shrugged and continued to eat his candy. Suddenly, he started coughing and choking.
"Lily, help me! I can't breathe!" Timmy gasped.
Lily quickly grabbed a glass of water and gave it to Timmy to drink. He drank it all up and felt better. 
"Thank you, Lily. I almost felt dead," Timmy said.
From that day on, Timmy learned to be more careful about what he ate and drank. And Lily was happy to have helped her friend.
