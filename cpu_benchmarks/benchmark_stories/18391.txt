Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and get his hair cut by the nice barber in town. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the barber shop for a haircut. The barber was very thoughtful and asked Timmy how he wanted his hair to look.
Timmy replied, "I want it short like my dad's hair." The barber smiled and started to cut Timmy's hair. As he cut, Timmy watched in the mirror and thought about how nice it was to have a haircut.
When the haircut was over, Timmy's mom paid the barber and they left the shop. Timmy was happy with his new haircut and thought about how nice it was to have a thoughtful barber. The moral of the story is that it's always important to be kind and thoughtful to others, because it can make someone's day and make them happy. And, sometimes, good things like haircuts have to end so we can appreciate them even more.
