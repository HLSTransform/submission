Once upon a time, there was a little kitten. The kitten was very hungry and wanted some milk. The kitten looked around but couldn't find any milk. 
Suddenly, a big cat came along. The big cat saw the little kitten and wanted to help. The big cat said, "Come with me little kitten, we can join together and find some milk." 
The little kitten was happy and followed the big cat. They walked and walked until they found a big bowl of milk. The little kitten drank the milk and was no longer hungry. The big cat and the little kitten became friends and played together every day.
