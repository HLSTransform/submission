Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. Jack loved to play soccer with his friends. He would kick the ball really hard and try to score a goal. One day, Jack's dad surprised him with a luxury toy car. It was so shiny and beautiful. Jack loved it so much and played with it all day. The toy car was so rare that none of Jack's friends had ever seen one like it before. Jack was very happy and thanked his dad for the wonderful gift.
