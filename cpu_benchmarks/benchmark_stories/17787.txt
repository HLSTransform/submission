Tommy was playing with his blocks one day. He was having a nice time building a tower and making silly noises. Suddenly, it started to rain and Tommy had to go inside to play.
Inside, Tommy's mom suggested a new game. She brought out a sheet full of colorful shapes and showed Tommy how to match them together. It was fun! He smiled and held up the sheet to show his mom.
Tommy spent the rest of the day matching shapes. The sheet was colorful and bright, and Tommy just couldn't get enough. The shapes were so nice and shiny that every time he matched one it made Tommy smile.
At the end of the day, Tommy was tired but he was so proud of all the shapes he had matched. His mom hugged him and said she was proud too. Tommy couldn't have been happier.
