Once there was a monkey. He was so popular. Everywhere he went, people said hello. One day, the monkey was feeling sad. He didn't know why, but he felt so lonely. He didn't want to talk to any of the other animals and he decided to take a walk all by himself. As he was walking, he heard the laughter of the other animals. He felt so happy that he wanted to join in the fun. So he climbed up a tree and asked if he could play with them. The animals were so thrilled to see him up in the tree. They all hugged him and became fast friends. The monkey felt so much better and everyone was happy that the popular monkey was back with them again.
