Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a big field with lots of vegetables. One day, a rabbit came and started eating all the vegetables. The farmer said, "Hey, rabbit! You are stealing my vegetables!"
The rabbit said, "I'm sorry, farmer. I was hungry and didn't have any food to eat."
The farmer felt bad for the rabbit and said, "It's okay, rabbit. I understand you were hungry. But please ask me next time and I will give you some vegetables to eat."
The rabbit was happy and said, "Thank you, farmer. I will ask you next time." From that day on, the rabbit and the farmer became good friends and shared the vegetables together.
