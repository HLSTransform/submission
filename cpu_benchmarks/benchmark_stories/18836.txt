Tom and Lily are playing with their toys on the carpet. Tom has a red car and Lily has a yellow doll. They make noises and pretend to drive and talk.
"Vroom, vroom, my car is fast!" Tom says.
"Hello, my doll is nice!" Lily says.
They are having fun, but then Tom sees Lily's doll and wants it.
"Can I have your doll?" Tom asks.
"No, it is mine!" Lily says.
"Please, I want to play with it!" Tom asks again.
"No, you have your car!" Lily says.
Tom is not happy. He tries to grab the doll from Lily, but Lily holds it tight. They pull and tug and shout.
"Stop, stop, you are hurting me!" Lily cries.
"Give me the doll, give me the doll!" Tom yells.
They are making a lot of noise and mess. The carpet is covered with toys and hair and dirt. Their mom hears them and comes to see what is wrong.
"What is going on here?" Mom asks.
She sees Tom and Lily fighting over the doll. She is not happy either. She takes the doll and the car from them.
"You are not sharing and playing nice!" Mom says.
"You need a time out!"
She puts Tom and Lily in separate corners of the room. They have to sit and be quiet for a while. They are not allowed to play with their toys.
Tom and Lily are sad and sorry. They look at each other and feel bad. They wish they had not fought over the doll. They wish they had been kind and fair.
They wait for Mom to come back. They hope she will let them play again. They promise to be good and share and play nice. They learn their lesson. They say sorry to each other and hug.
Mom sees them and smiles. She is proud of them. She gives them back their toys and hugs them too.
"Now you can play again, but be careful and gentle!" Mom says.
"Okay, Mom, we will!" Tom and Lily say.
They go back to the carpet and play with their toys. They take turns and help each other. They make noises and pretend to drive and talk.
"Vroom, vroom, your car is fast!" Lily says.
"Hello, your doll is nice!" Tom says.
They are having fun again. They are happy and friendly. They love each other and their toys. They love their mom and their carpet. They are a good brother and sister. The end.
