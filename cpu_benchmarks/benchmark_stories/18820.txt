Tom was a naughty boy. He liked to break things and make a mess. One day, he broke his sister's doll. He pulled off its hair and arms and threw them away. His sister cried and told their mom.
Mom was very angry. She gave Tom a lecture. She said, "You are a bad boy, Tom. You hurt your sister and her doll. You have to say sorry and restore the doll. You have to find the hair and arms and put them back. If you don't, you will have no toys and no cake."
Tom did not like the lecture. He did not want to say sorry or restore the doll. He thought the doll was ugly and boring. He wanted to play with his cars and trucks. He ran away and hid under his bed.
But mom found him. She pulled him out and made him look at the doll. She said, "This is your sister's doll. She loves it very much. It is not ugly. It is beautiful and sweet. You have to be kind and gentle to it. You have to fix it and make it happy again."
Tom felt sorry. He saw his sister's sad face and the doll's broken body. He realized he was wrong. He said, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, sister. I will restore the doll. I will find the hair and arms and glue them back. I will be a good boy."
Mom smiled and hugged him. She said, "That's good, Tom. I'm proud of you. You are learning to be responsible and caring. You can still play with your cars and trucks, but you have to share them with your sister. And you can have some cake, but you have to eat your vegetables first."
Tom nodded and smiled. He restored the doll and gave it to his sister. She hugged him and thanked him. They played together and had some cake. They were happy.
