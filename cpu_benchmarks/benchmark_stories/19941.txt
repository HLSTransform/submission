Lily and Ben were playing in the park when they saw dark clouds in the sky. They heard a loud boom and saw a bright flash. It was lightning and thunder. They were scared and ran to their mom.
Mom hugged them and said, "Don't worry, it's just a storm. Lightning and thunder can't hurt you. They are just noise and light. Let's go home and wait for it to pass."
On the way home, they saw a big tree that had fallen on the road. It was blocking the cars and the people. Lily and Ben felt sorry for them. They wanted to help.
They saw a man with a big saw. He was trying to cut the tree. Lily and Ben asked their mom, "Can we help him?"
Mom said, "Yes, you can. You can be helpful by staying away from the saw and the tree. You can also be helpful by picking up the small branches and putting them on the side of the road. That will make it easier for the man to work."
Lily and Ben nodded and did what their mom said. They picked up the small branches and moved them. They felt happy and proud. They were being helpful.
The man thanked them and said, "You are very good kids. You helped me a lot. Thank you."
Lily and Ben smiled and said, "You're welcome. We like to help."
They got home and the storm was over. The sun came out and the sky was blue. Lily and Ben looked at the rainbow and said, "Wow, it's so pretty. We think lightning and thunder are not so bad after all. They make rainbows."
