Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pink dress and loved to play with her kitten named Mittens. Mittens was very small and had soft fur.
One day, Lily and Mittens were playing outside when they saw a big dog. The dog barked and scared Mittens. Lily said, "Don't worry, Mittens. Just ignore the dog." Mittens listened to Lily and didn't pay attention to the dog.
The next day, Lily and Mittens were playing again when they saw the same dog. But this time, the dog had a ball in its mouth. The dog dropped the ball and Mittens started to play with it. Lily said, "Good job, Mittens. You ignored the dog yesterday and now he wants to play with you!" From that day on, Mittens and the dog played together every day.
