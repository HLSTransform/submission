Once there was a little yellow cat. He loved to play and run around. His favourite game was to speed around the house. Every day he would run faster and faster.
One day, the little cat was feeling really brave. He decided to take an exam and see if he was fast enough. He was so excited he couldn’t wait.
On the day of the exam, the little cat sped around the room faster than ever before. He was so fast he made all the other cats jealous. But he didn’t care, he was proud of himself.
When the exam was over the little yellow cat had done the best he could. He knew he was the fastest cat in the world.
