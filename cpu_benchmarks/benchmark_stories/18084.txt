Once upon a time, there was a little bird with gray feathers. The bird loved to fly high in the sky and sit on a branch. One day, the bird saw a big, juicy worm on the ground. The bird wanted to eat the worm but his mother told him it was not safe to eat worms on the ground. She said only worms on the branch were safe to eat. 
But the little bird didn't listen to his mother and flew down to the ground to eat the worm. As he was eating, a big, mean cat came and chased after him. The little bird tried to fly away, but he was too slow. The cat caught him and ate him for his dinner. 
The little bird's mother was very sad and wished she had not permitted her little bird to fly down to the ground. She knew he would still be alive if he had listened to her and stayed on the branch. The end.
