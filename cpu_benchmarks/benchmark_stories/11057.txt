Lily liked to play with her toys, but she did not like to share them. She had many toys, but her favorite was a cone that made sounds and lights when she pressed a button. She always kept the cone in her room and never let anyone touch it.
One day, her cousin Sam came to visit. Sam was younger than Lily and he liked to explore. He saw the cone on Lily's bed and wanted to play with it. He reached for the cone, but Lily saw him and shouted, "No! That's mine! Go away!" She grabbed the cone and shut the door in Sam's face.
Sam felt sad and hurt. He did not understand why Lily was so mean. He went to the living room and found some other toys to play with. He found a ball, a car, a doll, and a book. He had fun with them and shared them with Lily's mom and dad.
Lily heard Sam laughing and wondered what he was doing. She opened the door and peeked outside. She saw Sam playing happily with the other toys and her parents. She felt a little jealous and curious. She wanted to join them, but she also wanted to keep her cone.
She decided to take her cone with her and go to the living room. She hoped that Sam would not touch it again. She walked slowly and carefully, holding the cone close to her chest. But as she reached the stairs, she tripped and fell. The cone flew out of her hands and landed on the floor with a loud crash. It broke into many pieces. It did not make any sounds or lights anymore.
Lily cried and cried. She had lost her favorite toy. She wished she had been nicer to Sam and shared her cone with him. Maybe then it would not have broken. She realized that being selfish and rude was not a good way to treat others. She learned that toys are fragile, but friendship is strong. She said sorry to Sam and asked him to play with her. Sam forgave her and hugged her. They played together and had fun. Lily's mom and dad smiled and praised them. They were proud of their children.
