Once upon a time, there was a duck. The duck was feeling very fearful. He was scared because the sky was dark and he had no place he felt safe. 
Then, he saw a large oat. He was happy! He spread it out on the ground and started to eat it. 
Suddenly, the oat began to move. The duck was scared and wondered what was happening. He asked the oat, "What are you doing?"
The oat replied, "I'm growing! I'm going to be big enough for all of us to eat."
The duck was relieved. He was no longer fearful. He and the oat had become friends. They spread out the oat, inviting all their animal friends to have a feast!
