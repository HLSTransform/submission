One day, Tom saw a shiny car and wanted to make his own car shine. He asked his mom for help. His mom got out a cloth and some special polish. She started to polish the car. Tom watched as the car began to sparkle in the sun.
Next, Tom wanted to help his mom. He picked up the cloth and started to polish too. His mom smiled and said, "You're doing a great job, Tom!"
When they finished polishing, Tom noticed a scratch on the car. His mom took out a bandage and put it on the scratch. She said, "The bandage will make the car more flexible."
Tom felt proud of his shiny car. He ran to show it to his dad. Together they admired the polishing job they had done.
