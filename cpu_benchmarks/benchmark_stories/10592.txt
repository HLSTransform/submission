John was walking in the park. He saw a big open box. It looked like it held something interesting! He was curious and opened the box. Inside he saw something big and round. It was a test! John picked it up and smelled it. It smelled, yucky! He realized it was a rotten test. He quickly put the test back in the box and shut it tight. He continued walking in the park, always careful to keep an eye out for rot!
