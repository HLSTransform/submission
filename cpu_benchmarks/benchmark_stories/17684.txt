Once there was a little girl named Jane. She was three years old and she loved to plan adventures. One day, she planned to take a magical walk in the moonlight. She was so excited, she couldn't wait.
Jane gathered her things, put on her coat, and stepped into the night. What she didn't plan for was a nightmare. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, a giant, flying monster appeared. It was huge and it was chasing Jane. She screamed but the monster kept coming.
But then a charming fairy appeared. She waved her wand and the monster disappeared into thin air. Then the fairy laughed and said, "Don't worry, Jane. If you plan ahead, you'll never have to worry about a nightmare again." 
Jane smiled and thanked the fairy. She felt safe and secure, and she made a promise to herself that she would plan ahead next time. Every time she took a magical walk, she planned and she never had another nightmare.
