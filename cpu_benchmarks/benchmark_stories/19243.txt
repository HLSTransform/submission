Once upon a time there was a girl called Lily. She was very happy and always had a big smile. One day, she wanted to do something new. So she decided to go for a jog. When she started, she felt very calm.
As she jogged, she stopped to pick up some pretty flowers. She looked at them and smiled. She jogged some more and saw a friendly dog. She waved to the dog and it wagged its tail. Then she jogged on.
Soon, she came to the end of her jog. She had jogged for a long time and was very tired, but she was glad she had done it. She smiled at the exercise she had done, and how calm she had felt.
The end.
