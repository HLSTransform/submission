Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved pumpkins. One day, Tim went to the pumpkin patch with his mom. They wanted to choose a big pumpkin for their home.
In the pumpkin patch, there were many pumpkins. Some were big, some were small, and some were dirty. Tim saw a very big and dirty pumpkin. He said, "Mom, I want this one!" His mom looked at the dirty pumpkin and said, "Are you sure, Tim? It's very dirty."
Tim nodded and said, "Yes, I like it!" So, they took the big, dirty pumpkin home. Tim and his mom cleaned the pumpkin together. Then, they made a big, happy face on the pumpkin. Tim was very happy with his pumpkin. And they all lived happily ever after.
