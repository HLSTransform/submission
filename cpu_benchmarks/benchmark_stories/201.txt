Lily and Ben are playing in the living room. They see a letter on the table. It is for their mom. Lily wants to open it. She is curious.
"Let me see, let me see!" she says. She grabs the letter and tries to tear it.
"No, no, no!" Ben says. He is careful. He knows mom will be angry if they open her letter. He tries to take the letter from Lily.
They pull and tug. The letter rips. They hear a loud noise. It is mom. She is coming.
They hide the letter under the couch. They pretend to play with their toys. Mom enters the room. She smiles.
"Hello, my sweeties. Did you have fun?" she asks.
"Yes, mom. We played nice," Lily says.
"Me too," Ben says.
Mom looks at the table. She sees the envelope. It is empty. She frowns.
"Where is my letter?" she asks.
Lily and Ben look at each other. They are scared. They do not know what to say.
Lily pokes Ben. She whispers in his ear.
"Tell her, tell her!" she says.
Ben pokes Lily back. He whispers in her ear.
"No, you tell her, you tell her!" he says.
Mom hears them. She bends down. She looks under the couch. She sees the letter. It is torn. She sighs.
"Who did this?" she asks.
Lily and Ben look at the floor. They are sorry. They do not want to make mom sad.
They hug mom. They say together.
"We did, mom. We are sorry. We love you."
Mom hugs them back. She is not angry. She loves them too.
She says.
"It's okay, my sweeties. I forgive you. But next time, please be careful with my letters. They are important. They are from grandma. She misses us a lot."
Lily and Ben nod. They promise to be careful. They ask mom to read the letter to them. Mom smiles. She reads the letter. It is from grandma. She says she loves them a lot. She sends them kisses and hugs. Lily and Ben are happy. They send kisses and hugs back to grandma. They thank mom for the letter. They say they miss grandma too. They hope to see her soon.
