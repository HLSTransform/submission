Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing outside in the garden. He liked to dig in the dirt and find worms. He thought they were funny and wiggly. 
One day, Timmy was playing outside when he saw a big, scary dog. The dog barked and growled and it scared Timmy. He ran away as fast as he could. 
Timmy ran into the house and told his mom about the scary dog. His mom hugged him and told him he was safe. She made him a warm cup of cocoa and they sat together on the couch. 
But later that day, Timmy went back outside to play. He forgot about the scary dog and started digging in the dirt again. Suddenly, he felt something slimy and wiggly on his hand. It was a worm! Timmy was happy and laughed. 
But then, Timmy accidentally stepped on the worm and killed it. Timmy felt very sad and cried. His mom came outside and hugged him. She said it was okay and they could bury the worm in the garden. But Timmy still felt bad. The end.
