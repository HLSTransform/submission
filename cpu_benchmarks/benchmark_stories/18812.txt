Anna and Ben are playing with blocks. They like to make towers and houses with the blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. Some blocks have numbers on them.
"Look, Ben, I have a block with the number six!" Anna says, holding up a yellow block.
"Wow, that is a big number!" Ben says. "I have a block with the number four. It is blue."
They put their blocks together and make a big tower. They are happy and proud of their tower.
"Can we find more blocks with numbers?" Anna asks.
"Let's search!" Ben says.
They look around the room and search for more blocks with numbers. They find a block with the number one, a block with the number two, and a block with the number three. They add them to their tower.
"Look, we have all the numbers from one to six!" Anna says.
"That is amazing!" Ben says.
They search for more blocks with numbers, but they cannot find any. They look under the table, behind the sofa, and in the toy box. But all the blocks are empty. They have no numbers on them.
"Where are the other numbers?" Anna asks.
"I don't know," Ben says. "Maybe they are hiding."
They are sad and confused. They want to find more numbers.
"Maybe we can ask Mommy," Anna says.
"Maybe she knows," Ben says.
They leave their tower and go to find Mommy. They hope she can help them find more numbers. They like numbers. They are fun and smart.
