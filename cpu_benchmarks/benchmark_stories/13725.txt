Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden, but one day she got into a big fight with her best friend, Emily. They both said mean things to each other and Emily went home crying.
Lily felt very sad and regretted what she had said. She wanted to say sorry, but she was too scared. She decided to go outside and play in the soil to make herself feel better. She dug and dug, making a big mess in the garden.
Suddenly, Lily heard a quiet voice calling her name. It was Emily! She had come back to say sorry too. They hugged and made up, and Lily realized that saying sorry was the best thing to do. They played together in the quiet garden, making mud pies and having fun.
