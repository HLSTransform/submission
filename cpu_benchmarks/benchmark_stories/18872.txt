Anna liked to play with clay. She could make shapes and animals with her hands. She liked the soft texture of the clay. It felt nice and smooth.
One day, she found a new kind of clay in the art room. It was green and shiny. She wanted to try it. She took a piece and started to roll it. But it did not feel nice and smooth. It felt sticky and slimy. It made her hands dirty and wet.
She did not like the green clay. She wanted to quit. She tried to put it back in the box. But it stuck to her fingers. She pulled and pulled. But it did not come off. She felt frightened. She thought the green clay would never leave her.
She started to cry. She called for her teacher. Her teacher came and saw her. She smiled and said, "Don't worry, Anna. It's not clay. It's slime. It's a toy. It's supposed to be sticky and slimy. It's fun to play with. But if you don't like it, you can wash it off with water and soap. It's easy. Do you want to try?"
Anna nodded. She followed her teacher to the sink. She washed her hands with water and soap. The slime came off. Her hands were clean and dry. She felt better. She thanked her teacher. She decided to play with the soft clay again. She liked the soft texture of the clay. It felt nice and smooth.
