Tom loves his bicycle. He rides it every day in the park. He likes to go fast and feel the wind on his face. He also likes to make noises like a car or a plane.
One day, he sees a new bicycle in the park. It is shiny and red, with big wheels and a bell. Tom gazes at it with wonder. He wants to try it. He thinks it must be very fun to ride.
He walks over to the new bicycle and touches it. He feels the smooth metal and the rubber tires. He rings the bell. It makes a loud sound. He smiles.
But then, he hears a voice. It is a girl. She is angry. She says, "Hey, that's my bicycle! Get off it!" She runs over to Tom and pushes him away. She grabs her bicycle and glares at him.
Tom feels sad and scared. He runs back to his bicycle. It is dirty and old, with scratches and a broken light. He thinks it is not very fun to ride. He wishes he had a shiny and red bicycle like the girl.
He gets on his bicycle and pedals away. He does not make any noises. He does not feel the wind on his face. He only feels tears on his cheeks.
