Tina was very thoughtful. She wanted to do something special for her mom. She had an idea. She collected some clay at the park and used it to make a special birthday gift. When she was done, she took it to her mom and was very proud.
Her mom was so happy she hugged Tina. They hugged and laughed. Then, mommy remembered something. She said, "Tina, I need your help. Can you wash this clay off the table top? It is making a big mess!"
Tina smiled and got to work. She washed the clay off the table and the chairs. Mommy gave her a big hug and said "Thank you Tina. That was very thoughtful." Tina smiled and was glad she could help mommy.
