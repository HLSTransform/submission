Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sam. She wanted to find something exciting to do, so she decided to explore beyond her home. As she was walking, she came across a big mailbox. Sam had never seen it before and it seemed very mysterious - she had never seen a mailbox so big and without a familiar house around it. 
Curious, she decided to take a closer look. As she walked closer and closer to the mailbox she heard a voice coming from inside the box.
"Help me! Help me!" the voice cried out. Sam was scared and didn't know what to do. 
"Hello?" she replied. "Who's in there?".
A cheerful voice replied, "My name is Wally and I'm stuck in here! Please help me get out". 
Sam smiled and asked, "What should I do?".
"Can you open the door?" Wally asked.
Happily, Sam opened the door and Wally stepped out. Sam and Wally hugged and thanked each other for being so brave.
This experience taught Sam an important lesson - you can never be too afraid to help someone in need, even if it seems scary or unknown.
