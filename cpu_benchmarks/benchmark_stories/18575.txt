Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found a dirty tape on the ground. 
"Look what I found!" she said to her friend, Timmy. "It's a dirty tape."
"What's a tape?" asked Timmy.
"It's something you can listen to music on," explained Lily. "Let me show you."
Lily picked up the tape and showed Timmy how to put it in a tape player. They listened to music and danced around in the sunshine. It was a happy day for Lily and Timmy.
