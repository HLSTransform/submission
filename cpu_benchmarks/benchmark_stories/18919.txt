Anna liked to cook with her mom. She helped to cut the carrots, stir the soup and taste the food. Mom said she was a good helper and a patient girl.
One day, mom made a spicy dish with peppers and curry. Anna wanted to try it, but mom said it was too hot for her. Anna did not listen. She took a big spoon and put it in her mouth.
Anna felt a fire in her mouth. She cried and ran to the sink. She drank a lot of water, but it did not help. She felt very bad and sorry.
Mom came and hugged her. She gave her some milk and honey to make her feel better. She said, "Anna, you should hold your curiosity and listen to me. I know what is good for you. Spicy food is not for little kids. It can hurt you."
Anna nodded and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I learned my lesson. I will hold my curiosity and listen to you. I love you, mom."
Mom smiled and said, "I love you too, Anna. You are still a good helper and a patient girl. But next time, be careful with spicy food."
