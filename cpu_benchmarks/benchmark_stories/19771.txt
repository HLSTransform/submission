Once there was a little girl and she saw a jellyfish. She was very anxious and didn't know what to do. She wanted to get closer, but she was afraid it might sting her. So instead, she decided to pretend she was a jellyfish. She spread out her arms, just like a jellyfish, and floated around the room. She was so happy and it made her forget about being anxious. She pretended she was surrounded by seaweed and coral and she pretended that she was eating fish. She felt so free and joyful being a jellyfish. After a while, she had to come back to reality, but she would always remember how it felt to pretend to be a jellyfish.
