Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mom went to the grocery store. They saw a big green vegetable called celery. Lily's mom said, "Wow, this celery looks amazing! Let's buy it for dinner tonight."
Lily replied, "Okay, mommy. Can we go to the park after we eat dinner?"
"Yes, we can go to the park after dinner," said her mom.
Lily was very happy and excited to go to the park. She loved to swing and slide. When they got home, they cooked the celery for dinner. Lily tried it and said, "Yum, this celery is delicious!" After dinner, they went to the park and had so much fun. It was an amazing day for Lily and her mom.
