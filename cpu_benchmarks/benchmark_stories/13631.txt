Sara and Ben wanted to decorate their room. They had many things to make it pretty. They had paper, crayons, stickers, and glue. They also had some old socks, buttons, and yarn.
"Look, I made a flower with paper and crayons," Sara said. She showed Ben her drawing. "It is yellow and pink and has a green stem."
"That is nice, Sara," Ben said. He was busy with his own project. He took an old sock and stuffed it with yarn. He glued two buttons for eyes and a sticker for a mouth. He made a tail with another sock. "I made a sock cat," he said. He showed Sara his toy. "It is soft and flexible. You can bend it and hug it."
Sara liked Ben's sock cat. She touched it and felt its texture. "It is fuzzy and warm," she said. She gave Ben a hug. "You are very clever, Ben."
"Thank you, Sara," Ben said. He smiled and hugged her back. "You are very creative, Sara."
They were happy with their decorations. They hung Sara's flower on the wall and put Ben's sock cat on the bed. They looked around their room and felt proud. They had made it more colorful and cozy. They had fun decorating their room.
