Once upon a time, there was a big red barn on a farm. In the barn, there were many animals. There was a pig, a cow, a horse, and a funny chicken. The chicken loved to spin around and around. The other animals would watch and laugh. The pig said, "One day, your spinning will help us all."
One day, a disgusting smell came from the barn. The animals could not stand it. They looked around to find where the smell was coming from. They found a big pile of yucky, smelly trash in the corner of the barn.
The chicken had an idea! He started to spin around the trash. He spun faster and faster. The wind from his spinning blew the trash out of the barn. The animals cheered and thanked the chicken. Just like the pig said, the chicken's spinning helped them all. And from that day on, the barn was clean and the animals were happy.
