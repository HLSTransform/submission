Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore. One day, she found a big rock in her backyard. She wanted to see what was underneath it, but it was too heavy for her to lift.
Lily went to her mom and said, "Mommy, can you help me lift this rock? I want to see what's under it." Her mom said, "Sure, let's lift it together." They both lifted the rock and found a little bug hiding underneath.
Lily was so happy and said, "Look mommy, we found a bug! Is it safe for it to be outside without oxygen?" Her mom explained that bugs breathe oxygen just like we do and it's safe for them to be outside.
Lily was relieved and said, "Phew, I'm glad the bug is safe. Thank you for helping me lift the rock, mommy!" Her mom smiled and said, "Anytime, sweetie."
