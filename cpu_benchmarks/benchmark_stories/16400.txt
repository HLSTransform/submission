Ben and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toy cars and trucks. They have a big box of fuel for their toys. Fuel makes the cars and trucks go fast and make noise.
One day, Ben and Sam are playing in their room. Ben says, "I have an idea. Let's put some fuel in Mom's car. Then it will go faster and make more noise. It will be fun!"
Sam says, "I don't know, Ben. Mom said we should not touch her car. She said it is dangerous. And we need the fuel for our toys."
Ben says, "Don't be scared, Sam. It will be fine. Mom will not know. And we have enough fuel for our toys and her car. Come on, let's go!"
Ben and Sam sneak out of their room. They take the box of fuel with them. They go to the garage where Mom's car is. Ben opens the fuel cap and pours some fuel in the car. Sam watches nervously.
Suddenly, they hear Mom's voice. She says, "Ben! Sam! What are you doing? Stop that right now!"
Ben and Sam drop the box of fuel and run. But it is too late. The fuel spills on the floor and catches fire. The fire spreads to the car and the garage. The car and the garage explode. The noise is very loud. The fire is very hot. Ben and Sam are very scared. They cry for Mom.
Mom comes and hugs them. She is very angry and very sad. She says, "Ben! Sam! How could you do this? You could have been hurt or killed! You destroyed my car and the garage! You wasted the fuel! You did a very bad thing!"
Ben and Sam say, "We are sorry, Mom. We did not mean to. We just wanted to have fun. We believed it would be fine."
Mom says, "You should not have believed that. You should have listened to me. You should have been careful. You should have been smart. Now we have no car, no garage, and no fuel. We have a big problem."
