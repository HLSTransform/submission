Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Tom. Tom did not like to play with the other animals. He liked to watch them from his tree.
One day, Tom saw a dog named Max doing yoga. Max was very good at yoga. Tom thought it was funny and wanted to try it too. So Tom climbed down from the tree and went to Max.
"Can I try yoga too?" Tom asked Max. Max was happy to help. "Of course! Let's do yoga together," Max said. They did yoga together and had lots of fun.
After doing yoga, Tom was not grumpy anymore. He liked playing with Max and the other animals. From that day on, Tom and Max were best friends, and they did yoga together every day.
