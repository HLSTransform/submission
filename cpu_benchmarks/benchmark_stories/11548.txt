Once upon a time, in a small village, there was an adventurous boy named Tim. He loved to play with his toy spear and pretend he was a brave warrior. One day, while playing, he found a big bell with a long rope. Tim thought it would be fun to ring the bell.
As Tim pulled the rope, the bell rang loud and clear. But, oh no! It woke up the grumpy old bear who lived in a cave nearby. The bear came out, very mad, and started to chase Tim. Tim was scared, but he knew he had to be brave like a warrior.
Tim took his toy spear and waved it at the bear. He shouted, "Go away, bear!" The bear saw the spear and thought Tim was a strong warrior. The bear got scared and ran back to his cave. Tim felt very proud and happy. From that day on, the village knew Tim as the brave boy who saved them from the grumpy bear.
