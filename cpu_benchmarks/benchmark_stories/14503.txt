Once upon a time, there was a wagon. It wheeled around all day, every day. It was a crazy wagon, always going at top speed. One day, the wagon sickened and started to sneeze. It sneezed and sneezed, then stopped. The driver was shocked. "What happened?" he asked. Suddenly, the wagon started to sneeze again. Its sneezes were bigger this time. It was so crazy, sneezing like that! The driver smiled and decided to keep going. He and the wagon wheeled around on their journey. They had a lot of fun. The wagon was feeling better now, no more sneezing!
