Jane was curious as she looked out the window. It was a rare day, and even the birds were quiet. Jane frowned and then suddenly the earth began to part! Jane was startled and started to cry.
Her mom came over and hugged her tightly. "It's ok sweetheart, it's only an earthquake," she said softly. Jane blubbered and asked, "What's an earthquake?"
Her mom smiled and said, "It's when the earth moves around to make room for more." Jane's eyes widened curiously, "Like a new home for the birds?"
Her mom laughed and said, "Yes, just like that," and then gave Jane a big hug. She looked out the window and whispered, "Earthquakes sure are amazing things."
