Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy. They were planning something special for their 3 year old daughter Lucy. Daddy said to Mommy, "Let's tell her the truth!" But Mommy thought that it was too hard for Lucy to understand. 
So they came up with a plan. Daddy said to Mommy, "Let's give her a surprise!" So they took Lucy to the park and there was a big surprise. There were balloons and candy and toys everywhere!
Lucy was so excited. Then Mommy and Daddy told her the truth. Daddy said, "The thing we planned was to tell you that you are going swimming with us today! Isn't that great news?"
But Lucy didn't like the sound of swimming. She thought it was disgusting! 
Mommy laughed and said, "It can be fun! Let's give it a try and then you can decide if you like it or not, Ok?" 
Lucy agreed and ended up having a wonderful time swimming with Mommy and Daddy. She found out that swimming can be very fun!
