Once upon a time, there was a clever little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and sing songs all day long. One day, Lily's mommy took her to a big store where there were lots of toys and things to buy. 
As they walked around, Lily saw a luxury toy that she really wanted. She asked her mommy if she could have it, but her mommy said they couldn't afford it. Lily was sad, but then she saw a sign that said they could win the toy if they entered a contest.
Lily's mommy signed them up for the contest and they waited anxiously. Finally, they got a call that they had won the luxury toy! Lily was so happy and felt very clever for finding the sign that led to the contest. She played with her new toy all day long and sang songs about her good luck. The end.
