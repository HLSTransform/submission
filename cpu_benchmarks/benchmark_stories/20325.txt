Lily liked to play with her toys in the bath. She had a nice octopus that was pink and soft. She gave it a name: Ollie. She made Ollie swim and splash and hug her.
One day, her big brother Tom came into the bathroom. He was mean and liked to tease Lily. He saw Ollie and grabbed him. He said, "This is not a toy, this is a silly sock. I will throw it away."
Lily was very sad and angry. She shouted, "No, Tom, no! Ollie is my friend, give him back!" She tried to get Ollie, but Tom was too fast and strong. He ran out of the bathroom with Ollie.
Lily wept. She wept loud and hard. She felt alone and hurt. She wanted Ollie back.
Mom heard Lily weep. She came into the bathroom and saw Lily crying. She asked, "What's wrong, Lily? Why are you weeping?"
Lily told Mom what Tom did. Mom hugged Lily and said, "That was not nice of Tom. He should not take your toys. I will talk to him and get Ollie back. Don't worry, Lily, Ollie is safe."
Mom went to find Tom and made him give Ollie back. She told him to say sorry to Lily and to be nice to her. Tom said sorry, but he did not mean it. He still thought Ollie was a silly sock.
Mom gave Ollie back to Lily. Lily was very happy. She hugged Ollie and said, "I missed you, Ollie. You are my best friend. I love you."
Lily and Ollie played in the bath again. They had fun and laughed. Lily did not weep anymore. She was glad Mom helped her. She was glad Ollie was nice.
