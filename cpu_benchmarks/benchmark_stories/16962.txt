Ben and Lily went to the shop with Mom. They wanted to buy a new toy. Mom said they could choose one toy each. Ben saw a big truck with wheels and lights. He liked it very much. Lily saw a soft bear with a bow and a smile. She liked it very much.
They took their toys to the counter. Mom paid for them. She put the truck in a bag and gave it to Ben. She put the bear on her shoulder and gave it to Lily. They said thank you and left the shop.
On the way home, they walked by a park. They saw some kids playing on the swings and slides. Ben and Lily wanted to play too. Mom said they could play for a little while, but they had to be careful with their toys.
Ben and Lily ran to the park. They put their toys on a bench. They went to the swings and slides. They had fun. They forgot about their toys.
A bad boy saw their toys on the bench. He wanted them. He took the truck and the bear. He ran away. He did not care if Ben and Lily were sad.
Ben and Lily came back to the bench. They looked for their toys. They did not see them. They saw the bad boy running away with their toys. They cried. They ran after him. They shouted, "Give us back our toys!"
But the bad boy was too fast. He got away. He laughed. He did not care if Ben and Lily were sad.
Ben and Lily came back to Mom. They told her what happened. They cried. Mom hugged them. She said, "I'm sorry, my loves. That was a very mean thing to do. Maybe we can buy new toys another day."
But Ben and Lily did not feel better. They missed their toys. They wished they had been more careful. They wished the bad boy had been nicer. They wished they had their comfortable bear and their big truck. They were very sad. The end.
