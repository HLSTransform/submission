Sam liked to bounce on his bed. He bounced up and down, up and down, making funny noises. He bounced so high that he could touch the ceiling. He bounced so hard that his pillow fell on the floor.
But his mom did not like it when he bounced on his bed. She was working on her print. She had to print many papers for her job. She needed the printer to work fast and quiet. But Sam's bouncing made the printer shake and jam. The papers came out wrong and messy.
"Sam, stop bouncing on your bed!" his mom shouted. "You are making the printer go bad. I need to finish my print. It is very important."
Sam did not want to stop bouncing. He liked to bounce. He did not care about the print. He did not know why it was important. He bounced louder and faster, making more funny noises.
His mom was very frustrated. She ran to his room and opened the door. She saw Sam bouncing on his bed, smiling and laughing. She saw the pillow on the floor, the sheets on the window, and the toys on the dresser. She was very angry.
"Sam, enough!" she yelled. "You are making a big mess. You are not listening to me. You are being very naughty. Get off the bed right now!"
Sam stopped bouncing. He looked at his mom. He saw her red face, her big eyes, and her loud voice. He felt scared and sad. He did not want to make his mom angry. He did not want to be naughty. He got off the bed and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I just wanted to bounce. I like to bounce. It is fun."
His mom sighed. She looked at Sam. She saw his small body, his big ears, and his sorry face. She felt sorry and tired. She did not want to make Sam scared and sad. She did not want to be angry. She hugged him and said, "I know, Sam. I know you like to bounce. It is fun. But you have to be careful. You have to listen to me. You have to respect the print. It is not fun. It is work. Do you understand?"
Sam nodded. He hugged his mom back. He said, "I understand, mom. I will be careful. I will listen to you. I will respect the print. Can I bounce later?"
His mom smiled. She said, "Yes, Sam. You can bounce later. But not on the bed. On the trampoline. In the backyard. With me. How does that sound?"
Sam smiled too. He said, "That sounds great, mom. I love you."
His mom said, "I love you too, Sam. Now let's go fix the print."
