Lily liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had long hair, a pink dress and a smile. Lily took Anna everywhere. She hugged her, kissed her and talked to her.
One day, Lily saw a big machine in the kitchen. It was shiny and had numbers on it. Lily was curious. She wanted to know what the machine did. She asked her mom.
"That's a scale, Lily. It can tell you how much something weighs. Do you want to try it?" her mom said.
Lily nodded. She climbed on the machine and looked at the numbers. They changed and then stopped. Her mom read them.
"You weigh 15 kilos, Lily. That's very good. You're a healthy girl," her mom said.
Lily was happy. She wanted to know how much Anna weighed. She got off the machine and put Anna on it. She looked at the numbers. They changed and then stopped. Her mom read them.
"Anna weighs 0.5 kilos, Lily. That's very light. She's a delicate doll. You have to be careful with her," her mom said.
Lily was confused. She didn't know what delicate meant. She thought Anna was strong and brave. She picked up Anna and hugged her.
"Anna is not delicate, mom. She is my best friend. She can do anything," Lily said.
Her mom smiled and shook her head.
"Lily, I know you love Anna, but she is made of cloth and stuffing. She can tear and break easily. You have to be gentle with her. Don't throw her, don't pull her hair, don't get her wet. She is delicate, Lily. Do you understand?" her mom said.
Lily frowned. She didn't like the word delicate. She didn't want Anna to tear or break. She wanted Anna to be happy and safe. She nodded.
"I understand, mom. I will be gentle with Anna. I will take good care of her. She is delicate, but she is also strong and brave. Right, Anna?" Lily said.
Anna smiled. She loved Lily too. She was glad Lily was her friend. She was delicate, but she was also strong and brave. Right, Lily?
