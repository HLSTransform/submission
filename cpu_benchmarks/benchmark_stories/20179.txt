Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They find a big box under a tree. They want to see what is inside.
"Maybe it is a toy or a cake," Anna says.
"Or maybe it is a monster or a snake," Ben says.
They open the box and see something white and hard. It has holes for eyes and a mouth. It looks like a head, but not a real one.
"What is that?" Anna asks.
"I don't know. It is scary," Ben says.
They hear a voice from the box. It says, "Hello, children. I am a skull. I used to be a person, but now I am just bones. Do you want to be my friends?"
Anna and Ben scream and run away. They leave the box and the skull behind.
The skull is sad. It is lonely and cold. It wishes it had some skin and hair. It sees a scarf on the ground. It is red and soft. The skull thinks it is pretty. It wraps the scarf around its head. It feels a little warmer and happier.
"Maybe someone will like me now," the skull says. It waits for someone to come and play with it. But no one does. Everyone is afraid of the unknown skull.
