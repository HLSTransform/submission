Lily liked to record sounds with her toy phone. She would press the red button and talk or sing or make noises. Then she would press the green button and listen to what she recorded. She thought it was fun and funny.
One day, she found a big leaf on the ground. It was green and yellow and brown. It had a weird texture. It was not smooth like paper or soft like cloth. It was rough and bumpy and crackly. Lily wondered how it would sound if she recorded it.
She picked up the leaf and held it to her toy phone. She pressed the red button and rubbed the leaf on the phone. She heard it make a scratchy sound. She pressed the green button and listened to the sound. It sounded like a monster or a snake. Lily laughed and said, "That's a weird sound!"
She showed the leaf and the sound to her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "That's a very creative way to use your toy phone. You made a sound collage with the leaf. Do you want to try other things that have different textures?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, please!" She and her mom went around the house and the yard and found more things to record. They found a soft pillow, a hard rock, a fuzzy toy, a shiny spoon, a wet sponge, and a noisy bell. They recorded each thing and listened to the sounds. They made a lot of weird and wonderful sounds. Lily had a lot of fun with her toy phone and her mom.
