Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had a lamp in her room that she loved very much. One day, Lily accidentally broke the lamp and she was very sad. She didn't know what to do because she loved the lamp so much. 
Lily's mom saw her sad and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her mom about the broken lamp. Her mom said that it was okay and that they could fix it together. They went to the store and bought what they needed to fix the lamp. 
After they fixed the lamp, Lily was very happy. She realized that even though the lamp was broken, she still enjoyed spending time with her mom and fixing it together. Lily learned that sometimes things might get broken or unknown, but it's important to remember the people we love and the memories we create together.
