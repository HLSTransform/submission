Once upon a time there was a bald man and a little girl. The bald man was in a rush, so he quickly picked up the little girl and put her in his safe. The man had to rush to his job, but the little girl was scared. She held onto the man's neck tightly and closed her eyes. The man said, "Don't worry, I won't let you get hurt." 
As the man rushed through the busy streets, the little girl smiled. She was so cozy and safe in the man's arms. Soon, they arrived at the tall building where the man worked. He gave the little girl a kiss on her forehead and carried her inside. 
The man introduced the little girl to all his colleagues and everyone was so excited to meet her. After a long day, the bald man picked up the little girl again and rushed outside. 
The little girl waved goodbye as the man put her in his safe. The bald man smiled and said, "I'll always keep you safe". And they both rode off into the sunset.
