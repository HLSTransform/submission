Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to look at the flowers and smell them. Lily saw a daisy that was very pretty. It had white petals and a yellow middle. She wanted to pick it and give it to her mom.
"Look, Ben, a daisy!" she said. "Can I have it?"
Ben looked at the daisy. He saw that it was modest. It did not show off like the roses or the sunflowers. It was happy to grow in the grass and share its beauty with the bees and the butterflies.
"Maybe you should leave it, Lily," he said. "It is happy here. If you pick it, it will die."
Lily thought about it. She loved her mom, but she also loved the daisy. She did not want to make it sad.
"OK, Ben, I will leave it," she said. "But can we come back and see it again?"
"Sure, Lily, we can come back," he said. "But we have to be gentle and not step on it or pull it."
They smiled and waved at the daisy. Then they ran to play with the ball. The daisy smiled back and thanked them for being kind.
