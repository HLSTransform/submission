Once upon a time there was a little girl who was three years old. Her name was Mandy.
One day Mandy wanted to go to the park, so she asked her mum if she could go. Mum said yes, and Mandy was very happy.
When Mandy got to the park, she saw a big bug. She was so excited. Mandy ran over to the bug and said "Hi bug!" The bug didn't answer.
Mums saw Mandy talking to the bug, and she started to laugh. Mandy was very deep and shy, so she felt a bit embarrassed.
Mums said to Mandy "It's alright, sweetheart. It's fine to talk to bugs in the park".
Mandy smiled and carried on talking to the bug. She made lots of new bug friends and had lots of fun.
