Mia and Leo were best friends. They liked to play in the park, share their toys and tell each other secrets. One day, they found a big, shiny balloon in the grass. It was red and round and perfect.
"Wow, look at this!" Mia said, picking up the balloon. "It's so pretty!"
"Can I hold it?" Leo asked, reaching out his hand.
"Okay, but be careful," Mia said. "Don't let it go. It will fly away."
"I won't, I promise," Leo said. He took the balloon and gazed at it with wonder. He felt happy and proud.
They decided to take the balloon home and show their moms. They walked along the path, holding the balloon together. They smiled and laughed and sang.
But then, a big, mean dog came out of nowhere. It barked and growled and ran towards them. It wanted the balloon.
Mia and Leo were scared. They tried to run away, but the dog was faster. It jumped and bit the balloon.
Pop!
The balloon burst with a loud noise. It was gone. The dog ran away, happy with its prize.
Mia and Leo were sad. They cried and hugged each other.
"You broke your promise!" Mia said. "You let the balloon go!"
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Leo said. "It was the dog's fault! I didn't mean to!"
But Mia was angry. She pushed Leo away and ran home. She didn't want to be his friend anymore.
Leo was alone. He felt sorry and lonely. He wished he still had the balloon. He wished he still had Mia. He wished he could make it all better. But he couldn't. He had lost everything.
