Once there was a bulb that was pale. It was very lonely. One day, it heard a noise coming from outside. It was a loud sound that made the bulb very scared. 
The bulb looked outside and saw two little children running around in the garden. 
The bulb thought that it would be nice to make friends with them. So, it separated itself from the ground and rolled towards the children. 
The children were so excited to see the bulb! They were so happy that they started playing together.
The pale bulb was now part of a happy family. They would play together in the garden every day.
