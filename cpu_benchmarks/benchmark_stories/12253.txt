Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved to go for rides. His favorite thing to do was to hop on his bike and go as fast as he could. His bike had two pedals and his mom always said to go slow. But no matter what, he loved to pedal, pedal, pedal.
The little boy went on his bike rides all around the town. He always liked to find new places to explore. One day, he found a wide, open field. It was so wide he couldn't see the end! Then the little boy realized he was in a huge meadow full of flowers.
The little boy told his mom all about his discovery. She said he should bring some of the flowers back to put in their garden. So the little boy picked some of the prettiest flowers and started his journey home. What an exciting adventure he had!
