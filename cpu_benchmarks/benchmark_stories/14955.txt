Once upon a time there was a little rabbit named Sarah. She was so excited, she was going to finally jump on the pink scale. Sarah asked her mom, "Mommy, can I jump on the pink scale?" Her mom smiled and said, "I don't know, Sarah. You might not be big enough. But if you try your best, you can do anything". 
Suddenly, Sarah smiled and jumped with all of her might. She was so happy she actually did it, she jumped on the pink scale! She raised her paws and said, "Yay! I did it. Thank you mommy." Her mom praised Sarah and said, "That's great, Sarah. You taught yourself that if you try your best, you can do anything!" 
Sarah nodded and ran to the pink scale. She jumped over and over again with a big smile. She had learned a very important lesson that day, with hard work and effort, you can accomplish anything. 
The moral value of the story is: Hard work and effort will help you achieve your goals.
