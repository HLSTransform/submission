Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl named Jill. She was curious and liked to explore and find new things. One day she found an old box in a hidden corner of the park. Inside the box there was a magical piece of paper that caught her eye.
Jill pulled the paper out and noticed it was special. She could replace the paper with any object she wanted - be it a toy, candy or something else! She was so happy she ran back to her house and started dreaming up what she wanted to replace the paper with.
In the end she settled on a shiny gold coin that she'd seen in a shop window. When she put the coin into the box, a puff of coloured smoke rose up and when it vanished, a brand new toy car was in the box! It was so attractive and magical that Jill couldn't help but smile.
She kept the car close by ever since and still dreams of finding new things to replace it with. What kind of surprise will she find next?
