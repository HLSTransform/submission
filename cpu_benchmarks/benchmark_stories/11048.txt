Lily and Max were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for shiny things. Sometimes they found coins, buttons, or rocks. But today, they found something very special.
"Look, Lily, look!" Max shouted. He held up a clear, sparkly thing in his hand. "It's a crystal!"
Lily ran over to see. She gasped. The crystal was so pretty. It had many colors inside it, like a rainbow. She wanted to touch it.
"Can I see, Max? Can I hold it?" she asked.
Max nodded. He gave the crystal to Lily. She smiled and rubbed it with her fingers. It felt smooth and cold.
But then, something bad happened. Lily tripped over a root and fell down. She dropped the crystal. It landed on the grass and got dirty.
"Oh no!" Lily cried. "The crystal is all dirty! It's not pretty anymore!"
Max helped Lily get up. He saw the crystal on the ground. He picked it up and wiped it with his shirt. He tried to make it clean again.
"Don't cry, Lily," he said. "The crystal is still pretty. Look, it still sparkles. It's just a little dirty. That's normal. Everything gets dirty sometimes. We can wash it later."
Lily sniffed. She looked at the crystal. She saw that Max was right. The crystal still sparkled. It was still pretty. She felt better.
"Thank you, Max," she said. "You are a good friend. Can we share the crystal?"
Max smiled. He hugged Lily. He was happy that she was happy.
"Of course we can share the crystal," he said. "It's our special find. We can keep it in our treasure box. Come on, let's go show Mom and Dad."
They ran to the house, holding the crystal. They were very proud of their discovery. They had a lot of fun playing in the garden.
