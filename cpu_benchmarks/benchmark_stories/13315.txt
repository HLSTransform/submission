Once upon a time, there was a thoughtful little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toys in the bathtub. Every day, he would fill the bathtub with water and have fun splashing around.
One day, Timmy felt a sneeze coming. He tried to stop it, but it was too strong. "Achoo!" he sneezed, and all his toys fell into the water. Timmy was sad, but he thought he could still play with his toys in the water.
Timmy reached for his toys, but they were all wet and slippery. He tried to grab them, but they kept slipping away. He tried and tried, but he just couldn't hold on to them. Timmy started to cry because he couldn't play with his toys anymore. This was a bad day for Timmy, and he wished he never sneezed.
