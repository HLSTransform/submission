Once upon a time, there was a little flower called Daisy. Daisy wanted to blossom and be bigger than all of the other flowers around her. She asked the sun for help and he smiled at her.
One day, a friendly lawyer stopped by the flower bed to rest. Daisy told him all about how she wanted to bloom and be bigger than the other flowers.
He smiled and said, "You can do it if you try. Just be competitive and don't give up!" Daisy smiled at his words and gave him a big hug.
After that, Daisy bloomed bigger and brighter than any other flower around. Everyone could see how competitive she was and she was so proud of herself.
The lawyer also saw her flower blooming and was very happy for her. He smiled and said, "See, Daisy, I told you that you could do it!" Daisy smiled and thanked the lawyer for his advice.
