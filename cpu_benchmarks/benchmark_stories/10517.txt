Surfers was out at the beach with her mom. She was very hungry and excited. She watched as her mom grabbed a cooler out of the car. It was big and blue and shiny! Surfers thought it looked very cool.
Surfers's mom opened the cooler and pulled out a big pen and some paper. She smiled and said to Surfers, "Come on, let's write!" So Surfers and her mom sat down on the beach and wrote pretend stories together.
Surfers was so busy writing that when her mom said it was time to go, Surfers was surprised. She closed her notebook and put it back into the cooler. Then she hugged her mom and they walked back to the car.
As they drove away, Surfers felt happy and proud that she wrote a story all by herself. Even though she was still hungry, she was happy that she had an awesome day at the beach!
