Sara was a smart girl who liked to knit. She had many balls of wool in different colors. She could make hats, scarves, and mittens for herself and her friends.
One day, her friend Tom came to visit. He saw Sara knitting a blue hat. He liked the hat very much.
"Can I have a hat like that?" he asked Sara.
"Sure, I can make one for you. But I need more blue wool. I only have a little bit left," Sara said.
"Where can we get more blue wool?" Tom asked.
"Maybe we can ask Mrs. Lee. She has a lot of wool. She lives next door. She is very nice. She likes to knit too," Sara said.
Sara and Tom went to Mrs. Lee's house. They knocked on the door. Mrs. Lee opened the door and smiled.
"Hello, Sara and Tom. What can I do for you?" she asked.
"Hello, Mrs. Lee. We are knitting hats. But we need more blue wool. Can you lend us some blue wool, please?" Sara asked.
"Of course, I can lend you some blue wool. Come in, I have plenty of wool. You can choose any color you like," Mrs. Lee said.
She led them to her living room, where she had a big basket of wool. Sara and Tom thanked her and picked some blue wool. They also saw some other colors they liked.
"Can we have some red wool and some yellow wool too?" Tom asked.
"Sure, you can have as much as you need. You are very smart to knit hats. It is cold outside. You will need warm hats," Mrs. Lee said.
Sara and Tom thanked her again and went back to Sara's house. They knitted their hats with the wool Mrs. Lee lent them. They were very happy with their hats. They wore them to school the next day. Everyone admired their hats and asked them where they got them.
"We made them ourselves. Mrs. Lee lent us the wool. She is very nice. She has a lot of wool. She likes to knit too," Sara and Tom said.
