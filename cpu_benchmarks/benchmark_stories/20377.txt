Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play soccer with their friends. They are very good at kicking the ball and running fast. Sometimes they want to score more goals than the other team. But they also want to have fun and be nice.
One day, they play soccer with Lily and Tom. Lily and Tom are older and bigger. They are not very friendly. They push and shout and cheat. Anna and Ben do not like that. They want to play fair and have fun.
"Stop pushing me!" Anna says to Lily. "That is not nice!"
"Stop shouting at me!" Ben says to Tom. "That is not fair!"
Lily and Tom do not listen. They keep pushing and shouting and cheating. They score more goals than Anna and Ben. But they do not have fun. They are angry and mean.
Anna and Ben are sad. They do not want to play soccer with Lily and Tom anymore. They want to play with their friends who behave well and have fun.
"Let's go, Anna," Ben says. "We do not need them. We can play by ourselves. We are independent."
"OK, Ben," Anna says. "We can play by ourselves. We are independent. But we can also share and be nice."
They take their ball and go to another field. They play soccer by themselves. They score goals and have fun. They are independent and nice. They are happy.
