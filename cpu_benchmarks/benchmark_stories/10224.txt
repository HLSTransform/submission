Once upon a time, in a big jungle, there lived a little monkey named Momo. Momo loved to move and play with his friends all day. They would swing from tree to tree, and play fun games together.
One day, Momo woke up and felt very ready to play. He called out to his friends, "Come on, let's play in the jungle!" His friends, a bird, a frog, and a big cat came running. They were all ready to have a fun day in the jungle.
They played hide and seek, and Momo was very good at moving fast to find his friends. The big cat would hide in the tall grass, the bird would fly up high, and the frog would jump into the water. Momo would move quickly to find them all. They had a great day playing in the jungle, and they were all very happy.
