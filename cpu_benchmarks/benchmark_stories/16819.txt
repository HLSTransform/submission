Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very excited for his exam at school. He had studied very hard and wanted to show his teacher how much he knew. 
On the day of the exam, Timmy's friend Billy started teasing him. Billy said that Timmy was not smart enough to pass the exam. This made Timmy very sad and he started to cry. 
But then, Timmy's teacher saw what was happening and she told Billy to stop being rude and to be polite to Timmy. She said that everyone can do well if they try their best. 
Timmy felt better and he went to take his exam. He remembered everything he had studied and he did very well. When he got his exam back, he got an A+! He was so happy and proud to show his mom and dad. And he learned that being polite and trying your best is always the best way to succeed. The end.
