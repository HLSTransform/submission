Once upon a time there was a graceful bird. It lived in a big tree and could fly in the sky. Every day the bird would fly around looking for a place to hide its treasure.
One day, at noon the bird spotted a nice place to hide its treasure. It flew down to the ground and put its treasure inside a special box. It was a safe place with no one around.
The bird flew back up to the tree happy that its treasure was safely hidden. It looked around to make sure that no one had seen it. Then it flew away home.
Every day, the bird would go to the same place at noon and check on its treasure. It was happy to see that no one had stolen it. The bird felt so graceful for knowing it had such a special place to hide.
