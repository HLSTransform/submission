Once upon a time, there was a silly dog named Max. Max loved to play and run around all day. One day, Max found a big book called a novel. Max thought it was a toy and started to chew on it. But then Max's owner told him to stop and lie down. 
Max was sad because he wanted to play with the novel. So, when no one was looking, Max took the novel and ran away. Max ran and ran until he found a big tree. Max climbed up the tree and started to read the novel. 
But then, Max got scared because it was getting dark and he couldn't find his way back home. Max tried to climb down the tree, but he fell and hurt himself. Max was all alone and couldn't move. 
Eventually, Max's owner found him and took him to the vet. But it was too late, Max had hurt himself too much and didn't make it. Max's owner was very sad and wished Max had just listened and not taken the novel.
