Every night when bedtime comes, James' bedroom would get this special kind of glow. He wasn't sure why it happened, so he asked his parents.
"Mom, why is my bedroom getting a special kind of glow?" James asked.
"It's the stars," Mom replied. "They help us feel safe and snug at night."
James' eyes lit up and he asked if he could go outside and see them. His mom agreed and he put his shoes on, and they went to the backyard.
When they got there, James was shocked. He saw the sky was filled with hundreds of stars glowing brightly in the night sky.
"Wow!", he exclaimed. "It's so beautiful."
His mom smiled and said, "They are very helpful to us all. When you feel scared or lonely, just look up to the stars and it will make you feel better."
James wanted to try so he looked up and smiled as the stars glowed brightly in the night.
