Once upon a time there were two friends, Mike and Dan. They went outside to play in a wet field. The grass was wet and the sky was gray.
The two friends started to run and shout. Then, further away, they saw something. It was a row of boats in the pond. They wanted to take a ride, but there was a delay.
The sky had started to pour and the boats were getting wet. Mike and Dan saw that they had to wait. They watched the rain and talked while they waited. 
After a while, the rain stopped and the sky was clear again. They quickly grabbed a couple of boats and rowed away. They went so fast that the water splashed on their faces.
They spent the rest of the day in the boat, going up and down the long row. They waved to the other boats, sang songs and laughed along the way.
At the end of the day, they thanked each other before walking back home. They had had a great time and were sure to come back and play again!
