Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jake. Jake liked to explore and play in nature, so one day he went out to explore in the forest. 
The sun was already setting. As it got darker, Jake started to get a bit scared. He looked around and noticed that he was lost. Jake started to cry.
"Oh no! I'm lost. What if I can't find my way home?" he said to himself.
Suddenly, he heard a voice. "Don't worry young man. I'm here to help!"
Jake looked up, and there standing in front of him was a friendly old man. 
The old man said kindly, "It's getting dark and you shouldn't be out here by yourself. Come with me and I'll help you find your way home."
Jake was so relieved. He thanked the old man and followed him home. After a little while, they finally arrived at his house. His mom was so happy to see him and she gave him a big hug. 
"I'm so sorry you got lost," said his mom. "But I'm so glad you're home safe and sound." 
Jake nodded. He was happy to be home and grateful to the old man for helping him find his way back.
