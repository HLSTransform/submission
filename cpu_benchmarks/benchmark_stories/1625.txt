Tim and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. They were having fun. But then they saw a big dog. The dog was black and had sharp teeth. The dog was barking and running towards them.
"Help!" Tim shouted. "The dog is scary!"
Mia was brave. She picked up a stick and waved it at the dog. "Go away, dog!" she said. "We don't want to play with you!"
But the dog did not listen. The dog was angry and powerful. The dog jumped and bit Mia's arm. Mia cried out in pain. She dropped the stick and fell to the ground.
Tim ran to Mia. He saw blood on her arm. He was scared and sad. He wanted to help Mia. He took his shirt and tried to wipe the blood. But the blood did not stop. He did not know what to do.
"Tim, I'm hungry," Mia said. "Can we have a snack?"
Tim looked at Mia. He saw her eyes were closing. He knew she was very sick. He wished he had a snack for her. He wished he had a phone to call for help. He wished the dog was gone. But he had nothing. He could only hug Mia and cry.
