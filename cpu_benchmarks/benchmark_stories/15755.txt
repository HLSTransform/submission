Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She wanted to go on an adventure.
"Mommy, can I go on an adventure?" Sarah asked.
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Sarah, you can go. But first you need to make a promise. Can you do that?"
"Yes!" Sarah said. "I can make a promise."
Her mom said, "Alright, here's your promise. You must find a new hole and explore what's inside it. But make sure you stay safe. Can you do that?"
Sarah nodded her head. She was very excited. 
"Okay, let's go!" said Sarah's mother.
So off they went, looking for a new hole. It wasn't long before they found it. It was a big hole and Sarah was scared, but she was also excited. Together, they looked inside the hole and found lots of new things.
Sarah's mom smiled and said, "See? You kept your promise. Now you can go on your adventure."
Sarah smiled and said, "Okay! Thank you mom!" 
And so Sarah's adventure began!
