One day, there was a dog who was very fast. He loved to speed around and play. He always wanted to go faster and faster. The little dog had a special bubble around him when he ran. The bubble made him even faster and the other animals couldn't catch him.
One day, the little dog met his friend, a big, hairy bear. The bear was so big and strong, but he was also very slow. The bear asked the little dog if he could join him in his bubble and run with him. The little dog was excited and said yes.
They started running around together, faster and faster. The bear was getting faster and faster, just like the little dog. They had so much fun. Soon, the hairy bear was running just as fast as the little dog.
The little dog was so happy that he had made a new, fast friend. From then on, they ran together all the time, never stopping and always running at top speed.
