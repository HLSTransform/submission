Ben and Mia are playing in the garden. They have a big bucket of water and some cups. They like to fill the cups and pour the water on the flowers and the grass.
"Look, Mia, this flower is very pretty. It has many colors," Ben says, holding a cup of water.
"Yes, it is. Let me see," Mia says, walking towards Ben.
But Ben is naughty. He splashes the water on Mia's face and laughs. "Ha ha, you are wet!"
Mia is not happy. She feels the water on her eyes and nose and mouth. She is cold and angry. She grabs another cup of water and throws it at Ben. "No, you are wet!"
They start a water fight. They run and chase and splash each other. They have fun, but they also soak their clothes and shoes and hair.
Suddenly, they hear a loud sound. It is the bell. It is time to go inside. Mom is calling them for lunch.
"Come on, Ben and Mia, lunch is ready. What are you doing?" Mom says, looking at them.
They stop and look at each other. They are dripping and dirty and hungry. They smile sheepishly.
"We are playing with water, Mom. It is interesting," they say together.
Mom shakes her head and laughs. "You are silly. Come on, let's go and dry you up. And then you can tell me all about your interesting game."
