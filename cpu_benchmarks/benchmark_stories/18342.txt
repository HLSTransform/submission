Once upon a time, there was a smelly ship. The ship was big and blue. It sailed on the water with many animals inside. The animals were happy, but they did not like the smelly ship.
One day, a kind man came to fix the ship. He worked very hard. He cleaned the ship and made it nice for the animals. The animals were so happy that the ship was not smelly anymore.
The ship sailed on the water again. The animals played and had fun. The kind man waved goodbye to the animals. The animals were happy and the ship was not smelly anymore. And they all lived happily ever after.
