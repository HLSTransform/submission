Once upon a time there was a little cow called Beth. Beth was very playful and loved to bounce. Everywhere she went she would bounce up and down, happy and excited.
One day, Beth caught sight of a long spell in a nearby tree. She wondered what the spell was but she was too small to reach it. She thought for a moment before she got an idea. She carefully bounced as high as she could and managed to grab the spell! 
Beth asked the spell, “What can you do?” The spell answered in a whispery voice, “I can make your bounces longer. Would you like to try?”
Beth nodded eagerly and the spell began to work. Suddenly Beth’s bounces became much longer! She laughed and bounced around, overjoyed with her achievement. 
The long spell had helped Beth to bounce higher than ever before. From then on, she was always the bounciest cow in the entire land!
