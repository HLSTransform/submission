One day, a little girl and her mommy were walking to the hospital. The little girl was very scared. She kept asking her mommy why they were going. Her mommy told her that they were going to take an x-ray. 
The little girl wasn't sure what an x-ray was, but she kept walking. When they got to the hospital, they waited in a long line. Finally it was the little girl's turn. A man in a black coat took her to a special room. He told the little girl he was going to take an x-ray.
The little girl started to get scared. She wanted to quit. But her mommy told her it would be ok. The man put the little girl on a bed and put a special machine over her. He said he was going to take a picture. 
The little girl was very brave. She closed her eyes, and the man took the x-ray. When it was done, the little girl opened her eyes and looked at the picture. It was black and white, but she could see her bones inside her body. The little girl was very proud that she didn't quit.
