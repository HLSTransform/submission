Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play outside in the park. They enjoy the different seasons. In spring, they see colorful flowers and birds. In summer, they splash in the water and eat ice cream. In fall, they jump in the leaves and pick apples. In winter, they make snowmen and slide on the ice.
One day, they go to the park in winter. They see a big hill with snow. They want to slide down the hill. Anna says, "Let's use this sled. It is red and shiny. It is fast and fun." Ben says, "No, let's use this board. It is blue and smooth. It is cool and easy." They both want to use their own thing. They do not want to share. They start to argue.
"Red sled is better!" Anna says.
"Blue board is better!" Ben says.
They pull and tug at their things. They get angry and sad. They do not play anymore. They sit on the snow and pout.
A dog comes to the park. He sees the red sled and the blue board. He thinks they are toys. He runs to them and grabs them with his mouth. He runs away with them. He is happy.
Anna and Ben see the dog. They see their things. They are shocked and scared. They run after the dog. They shout, "Stop! Come back! Give us our things!"
The dog does not listen. He runs faster and farther. He goes to another park. He drops the red sled and the blue board. He finds a ball. He plays with the ball.
Anna and Ben reach the other park. They see their things. They are relieved and glad. They run to them and hug them. They say, "We are sorry. We were silly. We should have shared. We are friends."
They look at each other and smile. They decide to try each other's thing. Anna slides on the blue board. Ben slides on the red sled. They have fun. They enjoy the winter. They are happy.
