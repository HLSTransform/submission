Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. But then they saw a big dog. The dog was barking and running at them. Lily and Tom were scared.
"Help!" Lily cried. "The dog is coming!"
Tom grabbed Lily's hand. He wanted to protect her. He said, "Don't worry, Lily. I will keep you safe. We can go to the bench. The bench is high. The dog can't reach us there."
Tom and Lily ran to the bench. They climbed up and sat down. The dog followed them. It jumped and tried to bite them. But it was too short. It could not touch them.
"Go away, dog!" Tom shouted. "You are bad! You are not nice!"
The dog kept barking and jumping. It made a lot of noise. It made Lily and Tom dizzy. They wished the dog would stop.
Then they saw a man. The man was the dog's owner. He called the dog's name. He said, "Rex, come here! Stop that! You are naughty!"
The dog heard the man. It stopped barking and jumping. It ran to the man. The man put a leash on the dog. He said, "I'm sorry, kids. Rex is not mean. He just likes to play. But he doesn't know how to play gently. He needs to learn. I will take him home now."
The man and the dog left. Lily and Tom felt better. They were not scared anymore. They were not dizzy anymore. They smiled at each other. They held hands.
"Thank you, Tom," Lily said. "You are brave. You are my friend."
"You're welcome, Lily," Tom said. "You are sweet. You are my friend too."
They hugged. Then they went back to play. They had fun. They were happy.
