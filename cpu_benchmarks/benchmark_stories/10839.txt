Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside in the grass. His mommy and daddy had a big lawn in their yard. Timmy liked to run and jump on the grass. 
One day, Timmy saw a tiny seed on the ground. He picked it up and put it in the dirt. He watered it every day and watched it grow. Soon, it turned into a big plant with pretty flowers. Timmy was so happy that he could grow something all by himself. 
Timmy's mommy and daddy were very helpful. They helped him take care of his plant and the lawn. They all liked to play outside together. Timmy was so grateful to have such a helpful family. They all loved spending time together on their big, green lawn.
