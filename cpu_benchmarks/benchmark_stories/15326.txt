Once there was a little girl who was feeling very sleepy. She was walking around and couldn't keep her eyes open any longer.
So she decided to find a seat to rest. She looked around and saw a park bench beneath a tree. She ran to the bench, thankful to find somewhere to rest.
The little girl slumped down on the seat and closed her eyes. She was so happy and relieved to have a seat. She snuggled up and fell sound asleep.
The little girl slept for hours until the sun moved across the sky. She awoke, refreshed and not so sleepy. She thanked the seat for giving her such a comfortable rest and then she skipped away to have her next adventure.
