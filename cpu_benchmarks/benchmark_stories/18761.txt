Tom and Anna liked to play with their toy kitchen. They had pots and pans, spoons and forks, plates and cups, and a lot of pretend food. They also had aprons that their mom made for them. Tom's apron was blue and Anna's apron was pink.
One day, they decided to have a cooking contest. They each chose a dish to make and started to work. Tom wanted to make pizza and Anna wanted to make cake. They rolled the dough, added the toppings, and put them in the oven. Then they waited for their food to be ready.
"I bet my pizza is better than your cake," Tom said. He was very competitive and liked to win.
"No way, my cake is better than your pizza," Anna said. She was also very competitive and liked to challenge Tom.
They started to argue and shout. They did not notice that their food was burning in the oven. Smoke came out and filled the room. Their mom smelled the smoke and ran to the kitchen. She saw the mess and the burnt food and was very angry.
"What are you doing?" she asked. "You ruined your food and made a big mess. You should not fight over silly things. You should share and be nice to each other."
She took out the food and threw it away. She made them clean up the kitchen and wash their aprons. Then she gave them some bread and cheese for lunch.
"Next time, you should settle your differences in a better way," she said. "Maybe you can work together and make something yummy for everyone."
Tom and Anna felt sorry and hugged their mom. They said they were sorry and promised to be more cooperative. They learned their lesson and agreed to play nicely.
