Once upon a time, there was a girl named Joy. She had a very unique start in life and loved to explore.
One day, she decided to go on an adventure. Joy walked and walked until she saw something special: it was a river! She was so excited.
She ran over to the river and put her toes in the cold water. She gasped--it was so cold! After a few seconds, Joy noticed that the water was beginning to get warmer. Then she saw something strange--the river was melting away!
Joy was amazed. She had never seen anything like it before. She watched as the river melted away and she knew it was unique.
The melted river made her day extra special. Joy was so happy with her own unique start.
