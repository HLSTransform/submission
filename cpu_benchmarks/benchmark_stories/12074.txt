Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite cushion that she loved to hug. One day, Lily was playing with her toys when she accidentally fell off her chair. She was scared and started to cry, but her cushion was there to catch her. She felt safe and hugged her cushion tight. 
Lily's mom saw what happened and came to check on her. She asked if she was okay and Lily nodded her head. Her mom was happy to see that Lily was safe and sound. From that day on, Lily made sure to always have her cushion nearby when she was playing.
