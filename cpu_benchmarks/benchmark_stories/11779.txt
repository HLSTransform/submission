Billy and his family were very excited. Billy was going to the university. It was cold outside, but Billy was warm in his coat. His mum and dad said it was a special place.
They let Billy go in and explore. He looked around and saw lots of books and students. Billy smiled.
But then the university shut. It was cold and dark. No one was allowed in any more. Billy was sad. He had wanted to stay until it was time to go home.
Billy's family was very sad too. They had hoped Billy would learn lots at the university. Now he would have to stay home. They wouldn't let him go to the university again.
