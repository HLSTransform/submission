Sara and Tom like to play in the park. They like to slide, swing and run. One day, they see a big hill. They want to go up the hill and see what is on the other side.
They hold hands and start to climb. The hill is steep and slippery. They have to lean on each other to keep their balance. They are almost at the top when they hear a loud noise. It is a dog. A big, black, crazy dog. It is barking and running towards them.
Sara and Tom are scared. They let go of each other and try to run away. But they are too fast. They slip and fall. They roll down the hill. They bump into rocks and trees. They get dirt and grass on their clothes and faces. They land on the ground. They are hurt and sad.
The dog is still barking and running. It is coming closer and closer. Sara and Tom think they are in trouble. They hug each other and close their eyes. They hope the dog will go away.
But the dog does not want to hurt them. It is not a bad dog. It is a friendly dog. It is just excited and playful. It wants to say hello and have fun. It reaches them and licks their faces. It wags its tail and jumps around. It is a happy dog.
Sara and Tom open their eyes. They see the dog. They are surprised and confused. They do not know what to do. They are still scared and hurt. But they also see that the dog is not mean. It is just crazy. They decide to pet the dog and say hello. They hope the dog will be nice and calm.
The dog likes their touch and their voice. It stops barking and jumping. It sits down and snuggles with them. It is a good dog.
Sara and Tom smile and laugh. They are not sad anymore. They are happy. They have a new friend. They forget about the hill and the fall. They enjoy the moment. They are glad they met the crazy dog.
