He smiled at her and asked if she wanted to try playing the flute. Lily was scared at first, but she wanted to make a new friend. She tried playing the flute and it made a beautiful sound. The boy was happy and they played together for a long time. From that day on, Lily wasn't shy anymore and she loved playing the flute with her new friend. The end.
