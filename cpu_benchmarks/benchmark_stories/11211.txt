Once there was a man named Jed. Jed was very hungry and went to a nearby store to get something to eat. He found some meat, but it looked very filthy. When he touched it he found that it had begun to rot. 
Jed was so sad, he knew he couldn't eat the meat. He went back to the storekeeper and asked, "Why did you give me this filthy, rotted meat?"
The storekeeper was surprised, and apologized. He said, "I'm sorry, I didn't realize the meat was not good. I'll give you some fresh meat." Jed was so happy and thanked the storekeeper. 
Jed thanked the storekeeper and went back home with the fresh meat. He had a tasty meal and was happy he hadn't eaten the rotted, filthy meat!
