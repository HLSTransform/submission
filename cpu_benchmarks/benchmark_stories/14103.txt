Mum was measuring something. She held the long gas in one hand and stretched the other hand over it. She said it was to help her measure the length.
Dad was working hard. He had a big machine and he was turning lots of knobs and pushing lots of buttons. He was putting lots of gas into the machine. Dad said the gas would help make the machine work.
Mum and Dad talked about measuring things. Dad told Mum that he was measuring the amount of gas that went into the machine. They needed to measure it very carefully to make sure it was the right amount.
Mum and Dad kept working hard. After a while, they stopped and smiled. They both said they had measured the gas really well and their machine was going to work really beautifully.
