Once upon a time, there was a little mouse. This mouse was interesting because it had a big heart. It liked to help others and make new friends. The mouse lived in a small house in the woods.
One day, the mouse found a lost bird. The bird was sad and scared. The mouse said, "Don't worry, bird. I will help you find your way home." The mouse and the bird went on a long walk. They had to remain strong and keep going, even when they were tired.
Finally, they found the bird's home. The bird was very happy and thanked the mouse. The mouse felt good about helping the bird. The moral of the story is to always help others, even when it's hard.
