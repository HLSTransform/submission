Bella and Simon were best friends. They always did a lot of fun things together. One day, Simon asked Bella if she wanted to jog with him.
“Let’s jog!” said Simon.
Bella didn’t want to jog because she was really serious about walking slowly. But Simon was so persuasive that Bella finally said, “Ok. We can jog.”
Off they went, jogging together in the park. But Bella was too serious and slow and eventually, she couldn’t keep up with Simon. She got very tired so she stopped to take a rest. When she looked up, Simon was nowhere to be seen. He had jogged much faster than Bella and he was out of sight.
Bella was so sad and she started to cry. Suddenly, from far away, she heard Simon calling her name. He had been worried about her and had turned around to come back and look for her.
The moral of the story is that it’s important to be careful when you’re having fun. Don’t do something too serious, or you might be left alone.
