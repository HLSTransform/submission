Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to do things on his own, but he didn't like to wear his coat when it was cold outside. His mom always told him to wear his coat, but he never listened.
One day, Timmy went outside to play, and it was very cold. He didn't want to wear his coat, so he left it inside. Soon, he started to feel very cold, but he didn't want to go back inside to get his coat. He thought he could play for just a little bit longer.
But then, Timmy got very sick. He had to go to the hospital, and he was very sad. His mom told him that he should have listened and worn his coat. Timmy learned that it's important to listen to your mom and take care of yourself, even if you don't want to.
