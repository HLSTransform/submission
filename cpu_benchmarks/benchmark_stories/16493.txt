Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her tool set. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help fix a delicate vase that had broken. 
Lily got her tools and tried to fix the vase, but it was too hard. She said, "Mommy, I can't fix it. Can we rest and try again later?"
Mommy said, "Of course, Lily. Let's rest and then we can try again when we're ready."
Lily was happy to rest and play with her toys while she waited to try again. When they tried again later, Lily was able to fix the vase with her delicate touch and her trusty tools.
