Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie had a shiny triangle on its beak that sparkled in the light. One day, the birdie flew to a big tree and saw a shiny bell. The bell could ring very loud and the birdie wanted to try it. 
But the bell was too big for the birdie to ring. So, the birdie flew up to the top of the tree and saw a small bell. The birdie rang the small bell and it made a beautiful sound. The birdie was happy and rang the bell again and again.
But soon, the birdie realized that it was getting dark and it was time to go home. But the birdie had been ringing the bell for so long that it had attracted a big cat. The cat pounced on the birdie and sadly, the birdie didn't make it. 
The moral of the story is that sometimes, we can have fun playing with things, but we need to be careful because it can attract danger.
