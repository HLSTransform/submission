Gus was so excited to go to the museum. He had heard it was very fun and was looking forward to exploring all of the wonders it held.
As he arrived at the museum, he couldn't help but notice how available everything was. All of the exhibits were on display and ready to see.
Gus ran and ran, looking at all of the amazing things. He wanted to keep exploring but he knew he could only stay for a short time. 
As he was on his way out the door, Gus spotted the finest exhibit of all. It was a beautiful antique vase and he just had to have a closer look. When he stepped closer, the vase started to shake.
Gus was scared and backed away too quickly. The vase suddenly fell, smashing into a million pieces. Gus had broken the museum's most valuable item.
He started to cry, feeling so awful for what he had done. The museum was not available anymore.
