Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sarah. She was very popular among her classmates. Sarah loved to spin around and around like a sunflower in the sun.
One day, Sarah asked her friend, "Do you want to spin with me?"
Her friend was very excited. She said, "Yes! That looks like lots of fun!"
The two girls spun around and around, faster and faster, until they felt dizzy. When they stopped spinning, they both laughed. It felt like they were a sunflower in the sun, twirling around and around!
After that, they spun together every day. They became even more popular amongst their classmates when they spun. Everyone wanted to be part of the spinning party!
