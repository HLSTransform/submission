Once upon a time, there was an ancient mine. It was full of treasure and magic. A little boy dreamed of exploring the mine one day. 
One morning, the boy was very excited. He finally got to go and explore the mine. He grabbed his pickaxe and carefully made his way in. 
The boy explored deeper and deeper. He found lots of interesting things, like golden coins and sparkly gems. He couldn't believe how exciting the mine was! 
Finally, the boy got to the end of the mine. He was delighted to find even more treasure there! He put it all into his bag and was ready to leave. 
Suddenly, the ground started shaking. The boy knew he had to run. He quickly ran towards the entrance and made it out in time. The boy had finished exploring the ancient mine!
