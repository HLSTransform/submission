Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big purple truck with many fancy things on it. The truck had balloons, flowers, and sparkles. It looked like a party truck.
"Wow, look at that truck!" Lily said. "It is so pretty and fun!"
"Maybe it is for a birthday," Ben said. "Do you think they have cake?"
They ran to the truck and saw a lady with a smile. She was wearing a purple dress and a fancy hat. She saw the children and waved.
"Hello, little ones!" she said. "Do you like my truck?"
"Yes, we do!" Lily and Ben said. "It is amazing!"
"Thank you! I am Miss Purple, and I provide parties for people who need some joy. I have cake, games, and gifts for everyone. Would you like to join me?"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They nodded and smiled.
"Yes, please!" they said.
Miss Purple opened the door of the truck and invited them in. Lily and Ben had a wonderful time. They ate cake, played games, and got gifts. They thanked Miss Purple for her kindness and generosity.
"You are very welcome, my dears," Miss Purple said. "I am happy to provide you with some fun and happiness. You are both very sweet and polite. I hope to see you again soon!"
Lily and Ben hugged Miss Purple and waved goodbye. They ran back to their parents, who were waiting for them. They told them all about the purple truck and the fancy party. Their parents were glad that they had a good time and met a nice lady.
Lily and Ben never forgot Miss Purple and her truck. They always looked for it in the park, hoping to see her again. They learned that it is good to provide joy to others, and that purple and fancy are beautiful.
