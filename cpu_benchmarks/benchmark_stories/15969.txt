Once upon a time, there was a little frog. The frog liked to jump and play in the pond. One day, the frog saw a shiny coin on the ground. The frog thought the coin looked pretty and wanted to keep it. But when the frog tried to pick it up, the coin tasted bitter. The frog didn't like the bitter taste, so it decided to leave the coin alone and go back to jumping and playing in the pond. The end.
