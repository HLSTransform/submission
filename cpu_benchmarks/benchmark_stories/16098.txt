Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Annie. She was a curious three year old. Every night, she would look up to the night sky and make a wish to the stars.
One night, while she was looking up in the sky, Annie saw something very special. It was a beautiful comet, making its way across the starry night. Annie had never seen anything like it before.
Annie wanted to catch the comet and keep it for herself. She called out to her mom for help.
"Mommy, how do I fix the comet?" Annie asked eagerly.
Mommy smiled and replied, "That is a difficult task, but I believe in you. Just reach for the comet and make a wish. That should do the trick!"
Annie was so excited. She made a wish and reached for the comet, and before she knew it, she'd caught it. She was so happy she'd fixed the comet. 
Annie thanked her mom, then ran off to show the comet to her friends. 
The End.
