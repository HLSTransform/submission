Anna and Ben were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big package of blocks. They could build houses, towers, cars, and anything they wanted with the blocks.
One day, their mom said, "Anna and Ben, it's time to clean up your room. Put the blocks back in the package and put it on the shelf." Anna and Ben nodded and started to pick up the blocks. But they had a problem. They both wanted the same blocks. The red ones, the blue ones, the yellow ones. They did not want to share.
"Give me that block!" Anna said, pulling a red block from Ben's hand.
"No, it's mine!" Ben said, pulling it back.
"Stop it!" Anna said, pushing Ben.
"Ow!" Ben said, pushing Anna.
They started to fight and yell. The blocks fell on the floor. Some of them broke. The package ripped. Their mom heard the noise and came to their room. She was not happy.
"Anna and Ben, what are you doing?" she asked. "Why are you fighting? Why are you making a mess? Why are you breaking your blocks? You are spoiled children!"
Anna and Ben stopped fighting and looked at their mom. They felt bad. They knew they did something wrong.
"We're sorry, mom," they said.
"Sorry is not enough," their mom said. "You need to learn to share and be nice to each other. From now on, you will separate your blocks. Anna, you will only play with the green and purple blocks. Ben, you will only play with the orange and brown blocks. And you will not touch each other's blocks. Do you understand?"
Anna and Ben nodded. They did not like this idea. They liked all the colors. They liked to play together. But they did not want to make their mom angry again. They picked up their blocks and put them in two different packages. They put them on the shelf. They looked at each other. They felt sad. They wished they had not fought. They wished they had shared.
