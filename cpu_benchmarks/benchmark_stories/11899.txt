Once upon a time, there was a hippo named Harry. Harry was big and grey and loved to play in the mud. One day, Harry's mommy told him it was time to clean up. Harry didn't like to clean up because it was difficult for him. 
"I don't want to clean up, mommy," Harry said. 
"But Harry, you need to be clean and shiny like a polished penny," mommy hippo replied. 
Harry didn't know what "polished" meant, but he knew he didn't want to be a dirty hippo anymore. So, he tried his best to clean himself up. It was hard work, but he did it. 
When he was all clean, he felt happy and proud of himself. "Look, mommy! I'm shiny like a penny!" Harry said. 
Mommy hippo smiled and gave Harry a big hug. "Good job, Harry. Now, let's go play in the sun!"
