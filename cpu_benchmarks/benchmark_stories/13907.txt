One day, a girl named Lily wanted to play. She found a big box in her room. Inside the box, there was a pretty dress. The dress was dirty, but Lily did not care. She put on the dress and went outside to play.
Lily saw a little boat by the pond. She thought, "I want to sail the boat." So, she put the boat in the water and watched it sail. The wind blew, and the boat sailed fast. Lily was happy to see the boat sail.
Just then, her friend Tim came. He said, "Hi Lily! I like your dress, but it is dirty." Lily smiled and said, "Yes, it is dirty, but I like it. Do you want to sail the boat with me?" Tim said, "Yes, I do!" So, Lily and Tim played with the boat and had a fun day.
