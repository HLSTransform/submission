Tom and Anna were in school. They had to learn about history. History was boring. It was about old people and old things. Tom and Anna did not like history.
The teacher showed them a big book. The book had many pictures and words. The teacher said, "This is a very important book. It tells us about our history. We have to take good care of it."
Tom and Anna did not care. They wanted to play. They waited for the teacher to look away. Then they took the book and ran outside. They wanted to have fun with the book.
They threw the book in the air. They kicked the book. They ripped the book. They laughed and laughed. They did not see the big dog.
The big dog saw the book. The big dog liked books. The big dog wanted to eat the book. The big dog ran after the book. Tom and Anna were scared.
"Help! Help!" they shouted. "The dog wants to eat the book!"
The teacher heard them. The teacher ran outside. The teacher saw the dog and the book. The teacher was angry and sad.
"Stop! Stop!" the teacher said. "That is a very bad thing to do. You are hurting the book. You are hurting our history. You have to save the book. Give it to me!"
Tom and Anna were sorry. They did not want to hurt the book. They did not want to hurt history. They gave the book to the teacher. The teacher took the book and hugged it.
"Thank you for saving the book," the teacher said. "But you have to learn a lesson. History is not boring. History is amazing. History is about us and our stories. History is a gift. You have to respect it and love it."
Tom and Anna nodded. They felt bad. They wanted to learn more about history. They said sorry to the teacher and the book. They promised to be good and listen. The teacher smiled and forgave them. The teacher took them back to the classroom. The teacher showed them more pictures and words. Tom and Anna looked and listened. They learned and enjoyed. History was not boring. History was fun.
