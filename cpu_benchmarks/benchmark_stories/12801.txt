Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Susie. Susie was only three years old and enjoyed playing in her garden. One day, Susie decided to go play outside. As she stepped out of her door, she saw a big guard standing in front of her garden gate.
Susie was scared, but the guard looked very harmless. She said to the guard, "What's your name? Can I get into my garden?"
The guard replied, "I'm here to make sure nothing bad gets into your garden. Nobody can get through without my permission."
Susie thought for a moment, and then said, "But I'm harmless, can I get in please?" The guard smiled and said, "Yes little one, you can get in!" Susie happily ran into her garden and the guard watched over her happily.
