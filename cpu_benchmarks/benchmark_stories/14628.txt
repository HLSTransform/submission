Once upon a time there was a nosy chair. Every day the chair would look out of the window and watch the people go by. One day the chair saw something interesting.
It was a box! The box had a label on it that said "To Chair". Surprised, the chair wondered, who would send something to it? 
The chair opened the box and found something inside. It was a toy! A nice nosy toy that looked like the chair. The chair was so happy and played with the toy all day. 
The chair and the toy decided to thank the sender of the box. So, the chair got a piece of paper, wrote a thank you note and put it in an envelope. Then the chair sent the envelope off. 
The chair waited and waited, but no one ever came to collect the letter. However, the chair did not mind and kept playing with the toy. The chair and the toy were always nosy and they had great fun together.
