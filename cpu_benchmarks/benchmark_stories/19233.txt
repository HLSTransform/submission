Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play in his yard. He had a big tree with a tire swing that he loved to play on. One day, Timmy was playing on his swing when he saw a little bird with a broken wing. The bird looked tired and sad. 
Timmy wanted to help the bird, but he didn't know what to do. He asked his mom for help, and she told him to bring the bird inside and give it some water and seeds. Timmy was scared at first, but he trusted his mom and brought the bird inside. 
After a few days, the bird's wing was all better and it was ready to fly again. Timmy was sad to say goodbye to his new feathered friend, but he was happy that he could help. From that day on, Timmy knew that he could always trust his mom to help him do the right thing.
