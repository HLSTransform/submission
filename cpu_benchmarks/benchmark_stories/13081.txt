Once upon a time, there was a happy girl who lived in a big, wide universe. Every day, the sun shone brightly and she could see lots of colours in the sky. But one day, everything seemed very gloomy. The girl felt sad, so she decided to go outside and play.
She looked up at the sky, and started to wave her hands around. She waved and waved, and she wondered if anyone could see her. Suddenly, she could feel that the universe was waving back at her! 
The girl smiled and waved her hands even more. She felt happy and she knew that the universe was looking after her. The gloom was gone and her day was filled with sunshine!
