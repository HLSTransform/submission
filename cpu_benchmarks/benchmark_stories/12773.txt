Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jim. Jim was three years old and he loved playing in the garden. He had a little spade that he used to dig with.
One day Jim decided to dig a big hole. It was getting bigger and bigger and Jim's spade was helping him make big progress. He soon made the hole better and bigger than before. 
But then he felt something sharp against his arm. He looked down and saw a harsh sharp rock that was causing him pain. He wanted to get rid of it, so he used his spade to try and make it go away. 
But it was too hard and it didn’t move. Jim started to cry, until he heard his dad's voice. 
“What’s wrong, Jim?” his dad asked.
Jim pointed at the rock and said, “This rock is too harsh and it won’t move”.
“Let me help you,” his dad said. He took the spade and managed to make the rock go away. 
Jim smiled and gave his dad a big hug. And they both continued to play in the garden, with Jim using his spade to dig lots of delightful holes.
