Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to drink hot chocolate from her favorite mug. One day, she realized that her mug was missing. She looked everywhere for it, but couldn't find it. Lily felt very sad and lonely without her mug. 
She asked her mommy and daddy if they had seen it, but they hadn't. Lily started to cry because she loved her mug so much. Then, her little brother came along and said, "Look Lily, your mug is right here!" It was on the top shelf where Lily couldn't reach it. She was so happy to have her mug back and gave her little brother a big hug. From then on, Lily made sure to put her mug in a safe place where she could always find it.
