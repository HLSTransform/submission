Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys and their dog, Spot. But today, they have a task. Mom says they have to clean their room before they can go outside.
Ben and Lily look at their room. It is very messy. There are toys, books, clothes, and papers everywhere. They do not know where to start. They think the task is very difficult.
"I don't want to clean," Ben says. "Me neither," Lily says. "Can we just play?" They worry that Mom will be angry if they do not do the task.
Spot barks and wags his tail. He wants to play, too. He picks up a toy car and runs around the room. He knocks over a pile of books and makes more mess.
"Spot, no!" Ben and Lily shout. "You are making it worse!"
Mom hears the noise and comes to the room. She sees the mess and Spot with the toy car. She is not happy.
"Ben and Lily, what are you doing?" Mom asks. "You are supposed to clean your room, not make it more messy. And Spot, you are not helping. Drop the toy car, please."
Ben and Lily feel sorry. They know they have to do the task. They drop their toys and start to pick up the mess. Spot drops the toy car and sits on the bed. He looks sad.
"Mom, we are sorry," Ben and Lily say. "We will clean our room. Can we still go outside after?"
Mom smiles and hugs them. "Yes, you can go outside after you finish the task. But you have to do it well and fast. And Spot, you can go outside, too, but you have to behave. No more making messes, okay?"
Spot barks and wags his tail. He is happy. Ben and Lily are happy, too. They work together to clean their room. They think the task is not so difficult when they help each other. They finish the task and go outside with Spot. They play and have fun. They do not worry anymore.
