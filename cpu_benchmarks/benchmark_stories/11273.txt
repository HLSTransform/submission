One day, a little boy was in his garden playing with his marbles. He took the marbles out of their little bag and lined them up neatly on the grass. He thought about what kind of game he would play next when he heard a whistle.
Suddenly, a gentle wind came and swept up the marbles. It blew them into the sky and the little boy called out to the wind to stop. He ran after the wind and tried to catch the marbles midair but it was too late.
The wind started to laugh, "Ha ha ha! I'm sure you never expected that!" it said. The little boy became sad and replied, "No! Please stop! I want to get my marbles back!" The wind replied, "I'm sorry but I just can't. You'll have to find them yourself!"
The little boy then went on a long journey searching for the marbles. He asked the animals and trees he crossed, but no one knew where the marbles had gone. He eventually got tired and sat down under a tree.
Suddenly, he heard a tiny whistle. He followed the sound and it led him to his marbles! They were all lined up neatly and the wind had gathered them safely for him. The little boy was relieved and smiled. He thanked the gentle wind for his marbles and it whistled and blew away in the sky.
