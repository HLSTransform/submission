Once upon a time, there was a very good boat. It was a very big boat, and it could go on a long ride. It had room for lots of people, and it came with lots of things too. It included food, and lots of toys too.
The people that went on the boat were very happy. They all laughed and played together. They sang songs, and ate lots of food on the boat. It was a very good day.
Soon it was time to go back home. All the people got off the boat and said goodbye. But the boat stayed, so it could be there for more happy trips. 
Everyone was very happy to be on the boat. It was a very good boat and it would take them to lots of places.  They all said they'd be back soon, to take another ride on the good boat.
