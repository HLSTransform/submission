Once there was a little boy named Jack. He loved to explore and be creative. One day he was playing in his living room and he found an old rug. It was so big and colorful that he chose to display it on the wall. When Jack's mom saw what Jack had done, she was amazed.
"That's so creative, Jack!" she said.
Jack smiled and said, "I knew the rug would look great up there!"
His mom said he could keep the rug up as long as he wanted, so Jack displayed it proudly. Every day he would look at it and be so proud of his creative achievement. His rug became a beloved part of Jack's living room.
