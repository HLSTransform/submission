Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was 3 years old, and she loved snacking. Whenever she felt like it, she would grab a snack from the kitchen. 
One day, Lucy's mom told her that she needed to be more independent. She said, "Lucy, you're 3 years old now - so you can get your own snack. Go to the kitchen and get a snack all by yourself!" 
Lucy didn't know if she could do it, but she wanted to try. She slowly crept into the kitchen and opened the snack cupboard. She saw LOTS of yummy snacks and couldn't pick one. She asked her mom for help.
Her mom said, "You can do it, Lucy! Pick the snack that looks the yummiest to you!" 
Lucy took a deep breath, then reached into the cupboard. She pulled out some sweet bananas and smiled. She loved bananas! 
She proudly took her snack to the table and began to eat. She felt so proud - she did it all by herself!
