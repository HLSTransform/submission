Once there was a hungry little boy named Jim. He went to eat his snack and he found a delicious piece of candy. He was so excited to chew it! He grabbed it and started to chew. He chewed and chewed until it was all gone.
He decided to go for a jog. He ran and ran until he was tired. His tummy was rumbling, he was so hungry! Then he remembered the delicious candy he had chewed earlier. He wished he had saved some for later.
He felt miserable. He was both hungry and tired. He wanted something to eat but he had nothing. He wished he had some candy to make him feel better. He looked all around but there was nothing to eat.
Jim was very sad. Just then he heard a noise. He looked around and he saw a friendly bear! The bear had some candy and he offered some to Jim. Jim was so happy! He immediately grabbed a piece and chewed it. He felt much better and he thanked the friendly bear.
