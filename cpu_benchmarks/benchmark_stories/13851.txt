Once upon a time, there was a funny parrot. The parrot liked to talk and play with kids. One day, the parrot met a little boy. The boy said, "Hi, parrot! Let's play together!"
The boy and the funny parrot played all day. They played with a ball, and they played hide and seek. The parrot was very happy, and the boy was happy too. They laughed and had a lot of fun. But then, it was time for the boy to go home.
The boy said, "Bye, funny parrot! Let's play again soon!" But the funny parrot did not want the boy to go. The parrot was sad and flew away. The boy looked for the parrot, but he could not find him. The boy was sad too, and he went home. The funny parrot and the boy never saw each other again.
