Lily and Ben liked to play in the yard. They had a lot of junk that they found in the trash. They made cars and robots and houses with the junk. They had fun with their junk.
One day, a big dog came to the yard. He was hungry and angry. He saw the junk and thought it was food. He started to bite and tear the junk. He made a big mess. Lily and Ben were scared. They ran to the porch and hid.
"Go away, dog!" Lily shouted. "That is our junk, not your food!"
But the dog did not listen. He kept biting and tearing the junk. He found a bottle of hot sauce that Ben had used to make a rocket. He bit the bottle and the sauce came out. It was very spicy. The dog yelped and ran away. He did not like the spicy sauce.
Lily and Ben came out of the porch. They saw their junk was ruined. They were sad. They hugged each other.
"Sorry, Lily," Ben said. "I should not have used the hot sauce. It was a bad idea."
"It's okay, Ben," Lily said. "We can find more junk. We can make new things. We can unite our junk and make something better."
They smiled and held hands. They went to look for more junk. They were happy. They loved their junk.
