Once there was a man who lived in the city. He was very foolish and one day he wanted to show everyone how strong he was. He put his hands out, closed his eyes and shouted. A little girl who was walking nearby slapped his hands hard.
Everyone in the city was shocked. They all laughed at the man as he rubbed his stinging hands. The little girl had been so brave. She had taught the foolish man a lesson.
From then on the man was careful. He never tried to show off again. Everyone in the city was proud of the brave little girl and they told her story to all their friends and family.
