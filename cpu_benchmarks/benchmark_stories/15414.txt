Once upon a time there was a bald man. He was sitting on a bench outside and he was staring really hard at something. A curious 3 year old boy walked up to him and asked him what he was looking at.
The bald man pointed at an ambulance that was parked down the street. The ambulance's lights were flashing, and it was making loud noises. "Do you see that ambulance?" the bald man asked the 3 year old boy. The boy nodded and then asked why the ambulance was there. 
The bald man explained that the ambulance was there because something bad had happened. He said that the ambulance was taking someone who had gotten hurt to the hospital so they could get fixed up. 
The 3 year old boy felt worried about the person who was in the ambulance. He began to stare at the ambulance, wondering who was inside and hoping that they would get better soon.
