Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and go on adventures. One day, she went on a walk with her mommy and daddy. They walked and walked until they reached a big park.
Lily saw a boy playing with a ball and wanted to play too. She asked the boy if she could play with him, but he was being bossy and said no. Lily's heart felt sad, but then she saw a swing and ran to it. She swung back and forth, feeling happy again.
Suddenly, the boy came over and asked if he could swing too. Lily said yes and they swung together, laughing and having fun. Lily's heart felt full of joy and she was happy she didn't give up when the boy was being bossy. From then on, Lily and the boy became friends and played together every time they saw each other at the park.
