Tom and Mia lived in a small village with their mom and dad. They liked to play outside with their friends, but sometimes they had to help with chores. One day, mom asked them to go to the market and buy some bread and milk.
"Be careful, and stay together," mom said. "The market is close, but there are many people and cars."
Tom and Mia nodded and took a basket. They held hands and walked along the road. They saw some cows, some flowers, and some birds. They said hello to their neighbors.
When they reached the market, they saw many stalls with different things. They smelled fruits, cheese, and fish. They heard people talking, laughing, and bargaining. They looked for the bread and milk.
"Here they are," Tom said, pointing to a stall. He gave the seller some coins and took a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk. He put them in the basket.
"Thank you," Mia said, smiling.
"You're welcome," the seller said. "You are very polite and dependable children. Your mom must be proud of you."
Tom and Mia blushed and thanked him again. They turned to go back to the village.
"Wait," the seller said. "Take this, too." He handed them a small bag of cookies.
"For us?" Tom asked, surprised.
"Yes, for you," the seller said. "A gift for being such good customers. Enjoy!"
Tom and Mia thanked him once more and hugged him. They were very happy and excited. They ran back to the village, holding hands and sharing the cookies. They couldn't wait to tell mom about their adventure.
