Mia and Leo were having spaghetti for dinner. They liked spaghetti a lot. It was long and red and yummy. They used their forks to twirl the spaghetti and put it in their mouths.
"Look, Mia, I can make a funny face with spaghetti!" Leo said. He stuck some spaghetti on his nose and ears and smiled. Mia laughed and tried to do the same.
"Leo, Mia, stop playing with your food!" Mom said. She came to the table with a napkin. "You are making a mess. You need to wipe your faces and hands."
"But Mom, it's fun!" Leo said. "And interesting. We are making art with spaghetti."
"Spaghetti is not for art, it's for eating." Mom said. "And you need to be clean and polite at the table. Wipe your face and hands, please."
Mia and Leo sighed. They did not want to stop playing. But they knew Mom was right. They took the napkin and wiped their faces and hands. They said sorry to Mom.
"Thank you, Mia and Leo. That's very good of you." Mom said. She smiled and gave them a hug. "Now you can finish your spaghetti and have some dessert. How does that sound?"
Mia and Leo smiled back. They liked dessert a lot, too. They ate their spaghetti and waited for Mom to bring the dessert. They wondered what it would be. Maybe something long and red and yummy, too.
