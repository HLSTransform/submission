Once upon a time, there was a gifted boy named Tim. He was very good at making movies. He loved to provide fun for his friends.
One day, Tim made a movie about a big, happy dog. The dog liked to run and play with a ball. All of Tim's friends came to watch the movie. They laughed and clapped their hands.
After the movie, Tim's friends said, "Thank you for the fun movie, Tim!" They were happy that their gifted friend could provide a fun time for them. Tim smiled, knowing he made his friends happy.
