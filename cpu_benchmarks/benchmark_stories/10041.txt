Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their friends. They liked to run, jump and slide on the grass and the swings. They were having a lot of fun.
But then, a big dog came into the park. It was black and brown and had a loud bark. It ran towards the children and chased them. The children were scared and ran away. They tried to find a safe place to hide.
"Help! Help!" they shouted. "Go away, dog!"
Ben saw a group of grown-ups sitting on a bench. He thought they could help them. He ran to them and called, "Please, help us! There is a big dog and it is scary!"
But the grown-ups did not help. They laughed at Ben and said, "That is not a big dog. That is a puppy. It just wants to play. You are silly and scared of nothing."
Ben felt embarrassed. He did not like that the grown-ups laughed at him. He felt sad and angry. He wished they were nice and kind.
Lily saw that Ben was upset. She ran to him and gave him a hug. She said, "Don't worry, Ben. You are not silly. You are brave and smart. The grown-ups are mean and rude. We don't need them. We have each other and our friends."
Ben smiled and hugged Lily back. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are right. You are my best friend. And the puppy is not so scary. Maybe we can play with it later."
They went back to their friends and continued to play. They forgot about the grown-ups and the puppy. They were happy again.
