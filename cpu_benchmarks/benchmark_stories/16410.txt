Lily and Sam were at the park with their mum. They liked to play on the swings and the slide. They also liked to look at the sky and see the birds and the clouds.
"Look, Lily, an aeroplane!" Sam said, pointing up. "It is big and white and fast."
Lily looked up and saw the aeroplane too. She wondered where it was going and who was inside. She wanted to fly in an aeroplane someday.
"Can we go in an aeroplane, mum?" Lily asked.
Mum smiled and said, "Maybe one day, Lily. But aeroplanes are very expensive and far away. We have to save money and plan ahead."
Lily felt sad. She wanted to go in an aeroplane now. She thought it would be fun and exciting.
"Please, mum, please," Lily said. "Can we go in an aeroplane soon?"
Mum hugged Lily and said, "I know you want to go in an aeroplane, Lily, but we have to be patient and grateful for what we have. We have a nice home, good food, and each other. We can have fun here too."
Lily nodded. She knew mum was right. She loved her mum and Sam and their home. She still wanted to go in an aeroplane, but she decided to wait and hope. Maybe one day, she would see the world from the sky.
