Once there was a little girl named Mary. She loved to choose her own clothes each day. She put on her rain boots and said, "Today I choose the yellow boots!"
Mary ran outside on a fair day to play in the rain. She ran and the rain hit her cheeks and she laughed. She spun around in the rain and jumped in the puddles. She smiled and said, "This day is really fair!"
The rain began to stop, so Mary ran back inside before she got too wet. She changed out of her yellow rain boots and chose a pretty dress and matching shoes. Then she smiled and said, "Now I'm ready for my fair day!"
