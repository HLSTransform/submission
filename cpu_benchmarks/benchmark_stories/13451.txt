Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, while they were playing, Lily saw a bird sitting on a tree. The bird was singing a beautiful song. Lily wanted to get closer to the bird without scaring it away. So, she whispered to her friends to be quiet and not make any noise. 
Lily was very alert and careful as she slowly walked towards the bird. When she got close enough, she smiled at the bird and the bird smiled back at her. Lily was so happy that she had made a new friend. From that day on, Lily would visit the park every day to see her bird friend. They would sing and play together, and Lily would always remember to whisper and be very alert so as not to scare away her feathered friend.
