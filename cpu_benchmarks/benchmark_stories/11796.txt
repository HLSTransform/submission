Once upon a time, there was a flexible wolf who was walking in the forest. He saw something in the distance and stopped to gaze. It was a rabbit. The wolf wanted to catch the rabbit, so he began to move closer and closer to it. The wolf used his flexible body to sneak into the undergrowth, so the rabbit could not see him.
The rabbit was running really fast, trying to escape from the wolf. But eventually, the wolf managed to catch the rabbit. The wolf had a big smile on his face and looked really happy. But suddenly, the wolfâ€™s happiness changed. A big hunter with a gun came out of the woods and pointed it at the wolf. 
The hunter shot the wolf and the wolf died. The rabbit was safe, but the wolf was not. This was the bad ending to the story of the flexible wolf and the rabbit.
