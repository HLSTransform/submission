Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max had a toy board that he loved to play with all day. But Max's friend, a cat named Luna, did not have a toy board. Luna was jealous of Max's board.
One day, Max saw Luna looking sad. Max asked Luna, "Why are you sad?" Luna said, "I am sad because I want a toy board like yours." Max thought about it and decided to help Luna. Max went to his owner and requested a toy board for Luna.
Max's owner was kind and gave Luna a toy board. Now, Max and Luna both had toy boards to play with. They played together and were very happy. Luna was not jealous anymore, and they became the best of friends.
