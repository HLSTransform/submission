Once upon a time, an old man was walking by the beach. He saw a thin ship sailing far away in the sea. He wanted to get closer to it, so he decided to push his small boat to the sea.
When he got there, he shouted to the ship, “Hey! Are you there?”
A voice from the ship answered, “Yes, I’m here. What do you want?”
The old man said, “I just want to ask where are you going?”
The voice replied, “I’m going to find some new friends!”
The old man smiled and said, “Ok, I wish you a good journey.”
The thin ship sailed far away and the old man went back home. He taught his three-year-old granddaughter all about the thin ship.
The next day the three-year-old granddaughter took her dad’s hand and said, “Let’s go to the beach. I want to push a boat and find some new friends.”
 
And so the granddad and granddaughter got a boat and pushed it to the sea. They watched the thin ship sail away and smiled at each other.
