Ben and Lily were playing in the pool with their dad. They liked to splash and swim and have fun. Sometimes, dad would throw them in the air and catch them. They laughed and screamed with joy.
"Look, dad, I can dive!" Ben said. He put his head under the water and kicked his legs. He felt like a fish. He saw a toy bear at the bottom of the pool. He wanted to get it.
"Can I have the bear, dad?" he asked.
"Sure, you can, Ben. But you have to be strong and brave. The bear is very deep. Can you dive all the way down?" dad said.
"Yes, I can, dad. I am strong and brave. Watch me!" Ben said. He took a big breath and dived into the water. He felt the water in his ears and nose. He opened his eyes and saw the bear. He reached out his hand and grabbed it. He was happy.
He swam back to the surface and showed dad and Lily his bear. They clapped and cheered for him.
"Wow, Ben, you did it! You are a great diver! And you have a new friend. What is his name?" dad said.
"His name is Bob. He is a strong bear. He likes to dive too. Can we play with him, dad?" Ben said.
"Of course, we can, Ben. Bob is welcome to join us. Let's have more fun in the pool!" dad said.
They all hugged and smiled. They played with Bob the bear and had a wonderful time. They were a happy family.
