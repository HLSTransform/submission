Once upon a time there was a graceful bird who wanted to decorate her nest. She had many ideas, but she needed help with finding the right things to use.
One day, she flew to town and stopped by a shop that had a lot of colorful wrap. She was so excited! She chose a yellow wrap and a green one. She flew back to her nest carrying the wrap in her beak.
When she arrived at her nest, she carefully decorated it. She hung the yellow wrap on the branches and wrapped the green wrap around her eggs. She was very proud of her nest.
It looked so pretty! The bird then fluttered gracefully around her nest, happy with her beautiful touch. She was now ready for her eggs to hatch!
