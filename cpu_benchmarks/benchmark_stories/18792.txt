Tom and Anna like to play with trains. They have many trains and tracks in their room. They make a big station with boxes and paper. They pretend to be drivers and passengers.
One day, they want to see real trains. They ask their mom to take them to the station. Mom says no, it is too far and too busy. Tom and Anna are sad. They do not understand why mom says no. They think mom is mean.
They wait until mom is busy in the kitchen. They sneak out of the house. They run to the street. They see a bus that says station. They get on the bus. They do not have money. They hide under a seat.
The bus drives for a long time. Tom and Anna are scared. They do not know where they are. They do not see their house or their mom. They see many cars and people and noises. They want to go back.
The bus stops at the station. Tom and Anna get off the bus. They see many trains and tracks. They think they can play with them. They run to the trains. They do not see the signs or the lights or the guards. They do not hear the horns or the whistles or the shouts.
They find a train that looks like their toy train. They climb on the train. They sit in the driver's seat. They push the buttons and pull the levers. They do not know what they do. The train starts to move. It goes fast. It goes on the wrong track. It crashes into another train.
Tom and Anna are hurt. They cry. They see blood and fire and smoke. They see people running and screaming and helping. They see their mom. She is angry and sad and scared. She hugs them and takes them to the hospital. She says they are very naughty and very lucky. They do not understand. They wish they had stayed at home and played with their trains.
