Once upon a time, in a big tree, there were two birds named Tim and Tom. They both loved to fly and eat fruit. Tim and Tom were always competitive, trying to see who was the best at flying and finding the yummiest fruit.
One day, they saw a big, red fruit hanging high in the tree. They both wanted it, but it was too high to reach. Tim had an idea. He said, "Let's see who can fly the highest and get the fruit!" Tom agreed, and they began to fly up, up, up.
As they flew higher, Tim started to get tired. He thought he could not go any higher. But then, he remembered how much he wanted the big, red fruit. With a burst of energy, Tim flew higher and higher, finally reaching the fruit. He grabbed it with his beak and flew back down to share it with Tom. They both learned that being competitive can be fun, but sharing is even better.
