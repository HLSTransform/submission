Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had many toys, but she did not like to share them with anyone. One day, her aunt came to visit her. Her aunt brought a gift for Lily, a big and soft teddy bear.
Lily was very happy to see the teddy bear. She grabbed it from her aunt and hugged it. She said, "Thank you, aunt, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her aunt smiled and said, "You are welcome, Lily, but you know, toys are more fun when you share them with others. Maybe you can let your cousin play with your teddy bear when he comes over later. He likes teddy bears too."
Lily shook her head and said, "No, aunt, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her aunt sighed and said, "Okay, Lily, but remember, being selfish is not nice. Sharing is caring."
Later, Lily's cousin came over. He saw the teddy bear and said, "Wow, Lily, what a nice teddy bear. Can I play with it?"
Lily said, "No, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her cousin felt sad and said, "But Lily, I just want to play with it for a little while. Please, can I hold it?"
Lily said, "No, this is my teddy bear. It is only mine. No one can touch it."
Her cousin got angry and said, "Fine, Lily, you are a mean and greedy girl. I don't want to play with you anymore."
He ran away and left Lily alone with her teddy bear. Lily felt lonely and bored. She looked at her teddy bear and said, "You are my teddy bear. You are only mine. No one can touch you. But you are not fun. You are not wild. You do not talk. You do not laugh. You do not play. You are just a toy."
She realized that her teddy bear was not a real friend. She wished she had shared it with her cousin. She wished she had been nice and caring. She wished she had not been selfish and greedy. She learned a lesson. She decided to say sorry to her cousin and her aunt. She decided to share her toys with others. She decided to be a good and kind girl.
