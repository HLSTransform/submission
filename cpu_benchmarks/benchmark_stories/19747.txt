Molly was very excited. She had a new project - tying a pin to a string!
First, she found a nice pin. It was pink and shiny! She held it in her hand.
Then she got a piece of string. She used the string to tie the pin to one end. She thought it was fun to do.
When the pin was all tied up, Molly was very proud of herself. She waved the pin in the air and twirled around. She was so excited!
Molly showed her parents what she had done. They were very impressed with her work! They told her she had done an amazing job. Molly smiled. She was very happy that she had finished her project.
