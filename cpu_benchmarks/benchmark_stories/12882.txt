Once upon a time, there was a thief. He was not a very nice thief. He liked to pinch people. He would pinch people when they weren't looking.
One day, the thief wanted to pinch something very special. He thought and thought, and finally had a creative idea. He decided to pinch a diamond necklace from the jeweler.
So the thief waited until the jeweler was not looking. Then he quickly ran over and pinched the diamond necklace. He put it in his pocket and ran away, so no one could see him.
The jeweler saw him, but it was too late. The thief had already pinched the necklace and was gone. The jeweler was very sad. 
But, with some clever thinking, the jeweler managed to catch the thief. The thief was so surprised that someone was able to catch him! 
The thief learned a lesson that day. He never tried to pinch anything ever again.
