Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One night, Lily was scared of the dark. She wanted to sleep with her flashlight on. Her mommy told her that it's not good to waste batteries. Lily didn't listen and kept the flashlight on.
In the morning, Lily's flashlight didn't work anymore. She was sad and scared of the dark again. Her mommy told her that it's important to save things and not waste them. Lily learned her lesson and promised to save her flashlight batteries from now on.
The moral of the story is that it's important to save things and not waste them, so we can use them when we really need them.
