Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play in the park. One day, Lucy decided to have a go on the zip line. She stepped onto the seat, grasped the rope and gave a big push. 
The zip line started to move, faster and faster. Suddenly, there was a loud strike. The zip line had broken and Lucy crashed to the ground. She was scared and started to cry. Her friends rushed to help her. 
Luckily, Lucy wasn't hurt. They all helped to fix the zip line with lots of sticky tape. Soon, it was ready to go again and Lucy stepped back onto the seat. Everything seemed safe and with a big push, she was moving quickly on the zip line again! 
This time, she made it to the other side without any strikes or broken zips. Lucy cheered with her friends and they all went home.
