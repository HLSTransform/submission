Once upon a time there was a robot. She was very cool and loved to explore. One day, the robot went to a big factory.
The robot was amazed. She saw lots of machines and gadgets. Suddenly, the robot spotted something she had never seen before. It was a funny looking balloon filled with oxygen. She quickly ran over to take a closer look.
The robot looked confused. She couldn't understand what the oxygen-filled balloon was used for. Then she heard a voice.
"Hey! What are you doing?" said the voice.
The robot looked around and saw a kind man smiling at her.
"I found this oxygen-filled balloon and I don't know what it does? Can you tell me?" said the robot.
The kind man smiled. "Yes, sure! That's an oxygen tank. We use it to attach to certain machines that need oxygen to run."
The robot smiled. "Cool!" she said. "Now I know what to do with it!"
The robot thanked the man for his help, and she said goodbye. From then on, she knew exactly how to attach the oxygen tank to different machines.
