Once upon a time, there lived a little 3-year-old boy called Tom. Tom loved to dream and spend his days playing. One day, he woke up very early and decided to take a walk in the dark. 
Tom noticed the moon shining down on him and decided to try to write a poem about it. He reached for his pencil but soon realised he had no paper.
Tom then remembered what his parents had always told him: if he ever finds himself lost in the dark, he should look for the light. 
So he looked up once again towards the moon and, with its light to guide him, he wrote a beautiful poem.
Moral of the story:
No matter how dark things get, we should always look for the light to guide us.
