Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max was very troubled because he lost his bone. He asked his friend, a little bird, "Have you seen my bone?" The bird replied, "No, I haven't seen it. But don't worry, we'll find it together."
So, Max and the bird went on a search for the bone. They looked under bushes and behind trees. Finally, they found the bone buried in the ground. Max was very happy and said, "Thank you for helping me find my bone. You are my friend and you bring me peace."
The bird replied, "I'm glad I could help you. Friends help each other. Now, let's go bury the bone again so it will be safe." Max and the bird buried the bone and went on their way, feeling happy and peaceful.
