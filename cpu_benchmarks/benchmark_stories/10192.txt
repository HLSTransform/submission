Once upon a time, there was a bossy cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to tell everyone what to do. One day, Kitty found a map. The map showed the way to a big, yummy cake.
Kitty showed the map to her friend, Doggy. Kitty said, "Let's go find the cake!" Doggy looked at the map, but he did not recognize it. Kitty said, "I will tell you where to go."
Kitty and Doggy followed the map. They walked and walked until they found the big, yummy cake. They were so happy! Kitty said, "We did it!" And they ate the cake together.
