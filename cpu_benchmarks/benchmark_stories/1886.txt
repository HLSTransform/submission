Once upon a time there were two friends, Tom and Sarah. Tom was excited about his new toy. He showed it to Sarah and told her how much fun he was having with it.
But then something strange happened. Sarah wanted to play with it too, and she tried to take the toy away. Tom didn't want to share and he struck out at Sarah. He hit her in the lung and she started to cry.
Tom was shocked. He hadn't meant to hurt her. He was just so excited and wanted to show her the toy. He said sorry and hugged Sarah. She was sad, but eventually she forgave him.
Tom and Sarah had a long talk, and they agreed to always share and be gentle with each other. They both learnt a valuable lesson that day. From then on they were more careful and always kind to each other.
