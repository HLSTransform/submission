Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big truck with many boxes. They wanted to see what was inside. They ran to the truck and climbed on it.
A witch was hiding in one of the boxes. She was looking for new children to eat. She saw Tom and Lily and smiled. She jumped out of the box and grabbed them. They screamed and tried to get away, but the witch was too strong.
The witch put Tom and Lily in a big bag. She threw the bag in the back of the truck. She closed the door and locked it. She got in the front of the truck and drove away. She laughed and said, "I have two new snacks for my dinner!"
Tom and Lily cried and hugged each other. They wished they had not gone to the truck. They wished they had stayed with their mom and dad. They were very scared and sad. They did not know what the witch would do to them. They hoped someone would find them and save them, but no one did. The end.
