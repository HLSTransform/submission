Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play together. One day, they find a big box in the garage. They open the box and see many clothes. They see hats, shirts, dresses, and pants. They want to try them on.
Sara picks a pink dress and a yellow hat. She puts them on and twirls around. She feels pretty. Ben picks a blue shirt and a green pair of pants. He puts them on and jumps up and down. He feels cool.
They look at each other and laugh. They think they look funny. They pretend to be different people. Sara pretends to be a princess and Ben pretends to be a pirate.
"Hello, princess," Ben says. "Do you want to see my treasure?"
"Yes, please, pirate," Sara says. "What do you have?"
Ben shows her a shiny necklace and a gold coin. He says they are his treasure. Sara likes them. She asks if she can have them.
"No, they are mine," Ben says. "You can't have them."
Sara gets angry. She wants the treasure. She grabs the necklace and the coin from Ben. Ben gets angry too. He wants them back. He grabs Sara's hat and dress.
"Give me my treasure," Sara says.
"Give me my clothes," Ben says.
They pull and tug. They start to fight. They don't hear their mom coming.
Mom sees them fighting. She is not happy. She tells them to stop. She asks them what they are doing.
"We are playing," Sara says.
"We are fighting," Ben says.
Mom sees the clothes and the treasure. She says they are not theirs. She says they are unusual. She says they belong to grandma and grandpa. She says they are old and special. She says they can't play with them.
Sara and Ben feel sorry. They didn't know. They give back the clothes and the treasure. They say they are sorry. Mom hugs them. She says it's okay. She says they can play with other things.
She takes them to the kitchen. She says she has a surprise for them. She shows them a big cake. She says it is for them. She says they can eat it. Sara and Ben smile. They love cake. They forget about the clothes and the treasure. They eat the cake and enjoy it. They are happy.
