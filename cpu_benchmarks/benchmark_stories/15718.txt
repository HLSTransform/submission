Once upon a time there was a mummy and a daddy and a little boy called Tom. Tom liked to sing. One day his mummy said, "Let's go to the cafe!"
Tom was so happy and he sang a song. When they got to the cafe, mummy said, "What do you want for dessert?"
Tom looked at the menu and saw ice cream. He said, "Ice cream please!"
Mummy said, "Yes, ice cream for you!"
Tom was very grateful and he sang another song. He enjoyed every bite of his yummy ice cream.
When Tom finished his ice cream, mummy said, "That was delicious, wasn't it?"
Tom smiled and said, "Yes, it was yummy! Can I have more?"
Mummy laughed and said, "Why not? Let's get two more scoops!"
Tom was very happy. He sang a happy song and thanked mummy for the ice cream. They all enjoyed it together. The end.
