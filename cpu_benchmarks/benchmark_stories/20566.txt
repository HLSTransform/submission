Once upon a time there was a wide, sunny field. A bird was flying in the sky, flapping its wings and chirping happily.
Suddenly, the bird saw something far away in the field. He flew over to take a closer look.
The bird saw a small girl. She was standing in the field and waving her arms in the air. She smiled and waved loudly.
The bird flew all around her, twirling and flapping his wings. He was so happy to see the little girl waving.
The girl waved higher and higher, until the bird flew away to the sky. She watched as the bird flew off into the horizon, still waving her arms until he was out of sight.
The little girl never forgot that moment and the wide, sunny field. Every time she saw a bird, she waved and remembered the day when the bird flew with her.
