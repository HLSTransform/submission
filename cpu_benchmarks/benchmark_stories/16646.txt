Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play outside in his backyard. One day, he found a long pole on the ground. He picked it up and pretended it was a sword. Timmy swung the pole around and around, pretending he was a knight. Suddenly, the pole split in two! Timmy was surprised, but he wasn't sad because he knew he could use the two pieces to make a fort. He got some blankets and pillows and was ready to build his fort. Timmy was happy he found the pole and split it because now he had two things to play with!
