Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a girl named Amy. Amy loved to eat salad. One day, she went to the market to buy some vegetables for her salad.
At the market, Amy met a noisy bird. The bird said, "Hello, Amy! What are you doing?" Amy said, "I am buying vegetables for my salad." The bird said, "I can help you find the best vegetables!"
Amy and the noisy bird looked for the vegetables together. They found a sharp knife to cut the vegetables. The bird was very careful not to touch the sharp knife.
They went back to Amy's house and made a big salad. Amy and the noisy bird ate the salad together. They were very happy and became good friends. From that day on, they always made salads together.
