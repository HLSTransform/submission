Once upon a time, there was a loyal dog named Max. Max loved to play with his best friend, a little girl named Lily. They lived in a big house with a pretty garden. One sunny day, they saw a beautiful butterfly in the garden.
"Max, bring the butterfly to me!" said Lily. Max tried to catch the butterfly, but it flew away. They chased the butterfly all around the garden. The butterfly was very fast, and Max and Lily laughed as they ran.
Finally, the butterfly landed on a big flower. Max and Lily stopped running and looked at it. "Wow, it's so pretty!" said Lily. Max wagged his tail, happy to see the butterfly up close. They decided to let the butterfly stay in the garden, and Max and Lily went back to their house to play some more.
