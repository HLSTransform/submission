Once upon a time there was a little girl who went to the shop. She wanted to buy a present for her friend. She saw lots of cheap threads in all different colours. She decided to buy the blue thread, as it was her friend's favourite colour.
The little girl paid for her thread and the shopkeeper gave her two needles. The little girl said "thank you" and ran out of the shop.
When she got home, she carefully took out her thread and bright needle. She carefully poked the needle through the cloth and made a big loop. The little girl rounded the corners and made sure the thread was all in the same direction. This was called marking.
When she was finished, the little girl had made a wonderful present for her friend. She was so happy and couldn't wait to give the present to her friend. 
The little girl showed her friend the present and the friend was so excited. They shared a big hug and thanked each other for the wonderful present.
