Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had long hair that was always tangled. One day, she went into the forest to wander around. She saw many trees and animals. She felt glad to be there.
Suddenly, she saw a squirrel who had a comb in its paw. "Hello, Mr. Squirrel. What are you doing with that comb?" asked Lily. "I am combing my fur. It helps me stay clean and neat," replied the squirrel. "Can I try it?" asked Lily. "Sure!" said the squirrel.
Lily combed her hair with the squirrel's comb. It felt nice and smooth. She was glad she found the squirrel and the comb. They became friends and wandered around the forest together.
