Once upon a time there was a girl called Jane. Jane loved to dress up in nice clothes. One day, Jane decided to go to the beach, so she put on her favourite dress and went. Suddenly, Jane heard a noise, so she looked out into the sea.
To her surprise, she saw a dead fish floating in the water. She was very sad and hoped the fish was not hurt. She wanted to help, so she ran to the shore and spread out a big towel on the sand. 
She gently scooped the dead fish from the water and placed it on the towel. With a big sigh, she said goodbye, then folded up the towel and put the fish back in the water. She knew it was gone to a better place. 
Jane felt better and went for a swim in the refreshing water. After some time, she said goodbye to the beach, put on her dress and went home.
