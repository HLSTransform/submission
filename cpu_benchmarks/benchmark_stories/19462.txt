One day, the van started to break. It wouldn't go anymore. Everyone was sad because the van was broken and it made them so sad.
The people came together and decided to fix the van. They worked together for hours and hours and soon the van was fixed.
When the people were done, the van was ready to go. Everyone cheered and clapped as the van drove away. It was the happiest day ever! 
The van drove around, taking people places and making them smile all along the way. Everyone was proud of the van and they knew it was the best van ever!
