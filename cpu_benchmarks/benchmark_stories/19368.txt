Once upon a time, there was a large tree that stood in a garden.
Every day, the tree would grow bigger and bigger until it was taller than the sun.
The sun was so happy it pretended to dance around the tree and give it a hug.
At night, the tree would take a long nap and dream of growing taller.
In the morning, the tree would wake up and stretch to reach the sky.
As time passed, the large tree became even taller until it reached all the way to the stars.
The stars were so impressed with the tree that they sent down a special star to keep it company.
The star and the tree were like friends, and together they watched the sun rise and the moon shine.
The tree had grown so large that it could now see all the way around the world.
Everyone who passed by the tree was filled with joy and amazement.
The tree was so happy, it took a nap and dreamed of growing even bigger.
