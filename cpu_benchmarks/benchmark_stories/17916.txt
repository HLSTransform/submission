Every summer, the family goes to a special camp. They stay in a small cabin in the woods, and they have a lot of fun! The children play in the sunshine and explore the meadow and woods. There are so many wonderful things to see and do. The days are mild and the sun is warm.
At night, the family gathers around the campfire. They toast marshmallows and tell stories. Everyone loves the songs and jokes. Then, when the stars come out, the family falls asleep in their cabin.
In the mornings, they wake up to the birds singing. The family plays all day and has a great time. And at night they gather round the still-glowing campfire and talk, until it is time to go to sleep again.
The family is sad when their stay at camp comes to an end, but they know they will return next year.
