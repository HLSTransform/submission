Ben and Mia love to play on the swing in their lawn. They take turns to push each other and go high in the air. They laugh and shout and have fun.
One day, a big dog comes to their lawn. He is black and brown and has sharp teeth. He barks and growls and runs towards the swing. He is fierce and scary.
Ben and Mia are afraid of the dog. They hold each other and scream for help. They want their mom and dad to come and save them.
But the dog does not want to hurt them. He only wants to play with them. He thinks the swing is a toy and he wants to catch it. He jumps and bites the swing and pulls it with his mouth.
The swing breaks and falls to the ground. The dog is happy and wags his tail. He licks Ben and Mia and tries to be friendly.
Ben and Mia are still scared and cry. They do not like the dog. They do not want to play with him. They want their swing back.
Their mom and dad hear their cries and come to the lawn. They see the dog and the broken swing. They are angry and sad.
They shoo the dog away and hug Ben and Mia. They comfort them and tell them they are safe. They promise to fix the swing or buy a new one.
Ben and Mia stop crying and smile. They love their mom and dad. They hope the dog will not come back. They want to play on the swing again.
