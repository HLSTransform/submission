Once upon a time, there were two little girls who looked out the window one day. They seemed so excited! Outside, there was a cactus. It was very tall, but it was patient. The girls had a funny idea. They decided to try and climb it like a ladder.
They tried their best, but they couldn't reach the top. The cactus was just too tall. But they seemed to be having fun trying. Eventually they had to give up. On their way back inside, one of the girls had an idea. She suggested that they bring back some of their toys and build a tower around the cactus. 
So, the girls grabbed their dolls, stuffed animals and toy blocks. They worked together and it didn't take long for the tower to grow. When they were finished, the tower was so high it almost reached the top of the cactus! The girls were so proud of their work. 
The cactus seemed happy too. It just stood there patient and tall no matter how many times the girls climbed it or built towers around it. It was the perfect friend for the two little girls.
