Lily and Ben were playing with their crayons. They liked to draw many things on the paper. Lily drew a big sun, a house and a flower. Ben drew a car, a tree and a dog. They were very happy with their drawings.
"Look at my sun, Ben!" Lily said. "It is very bright and yellow."
"Wow, Lily, your sun is incredible!" Ben said. "Look at my car, Lily! It is very fast and red."
"Wow, Ben, your car is incredible!" Lily said. "Can I try your red crayon?"
"Sure, Lily, you can try my red crayon," Ben said. He gave Lily his red crayon and took her yellow crayon.
Lily and Ben started to draw with the new crayons. They made more lines and shapes on the paper. They had fun with the new colors.
But then, something strange happened. The red crayon started to disappear in Lily's hand. It became smaller and smaller until it was gone. Lily was very surprised and sad.
"Ben, Ben, where is your red crayon?" Lily asked. "It disappeared in my hand!"
Ben looked at Lily's hand and saw no red crayon. He was very surprised and sad too.
"Lily, Lily, where is my yellow crayon?" Ben asked. "It disappeared in my hand too!"
Lily looked at Ben's hand and saw no yellow crayon. She was very sorry and hugged Ben.
"I don't know what happened, Ben," Lily said. "Maybe the crayons were magic and they flew away."
"Maybe, Lily, maybe," Ben said. "But I still like your sun and your flower. And I still like your car and your dog."
"Thank you, Ben," Lily said. "And I still like you."
"Thank you, Lily," Ben said. "And I still like you too."
They smiled and held hands. They decided to play with their other crayons and make more incredible drawings. They hoped the red and yellow crayons would come back someday.
