Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and dress up in her pretty dresses. One day, Lily's mommy asked her to clean up her room and organize her toys. Lily didn't want to do it, but she knew it was important to listen to her mommy.
As she was cleaning, Lily found a shiny mirror under her bed. She picked it up and looked at herself. She smiled and saw that her hair was messy. She decided to use her brush to fix it. When she was done, she put the mirror back where she found it.
After Lily finished cleaning, she felt proud of herself. She went to her mommy and said, "Look mommy, my room is clean and organized!" Her mommy was happy and gave her a big hug. Lily felt happy too and went to play with her toys with her room open and bright.
