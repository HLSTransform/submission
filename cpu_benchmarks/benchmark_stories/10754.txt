Once upon a time, there was a big, serious train. This train had a job to move coal from one place to another. The train loved its job and would always enjoy going on trips.
One day, the train met a little, red car. The car said, "Hello, big train! Can I help you move the coal?" The train thought for a moment and said, "Yes, little car, you can help me. We can work together and have fun!"
So, the big, serious train and the little, red car worked together to move the coal. They enjoyed their time together, and they became good friends. The train learned that even though it had a serious job, it could still have fun with its new friend the car.
