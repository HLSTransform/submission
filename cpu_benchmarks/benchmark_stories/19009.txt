Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went to the park with her mommy and daddy. It was a hot day and Lily wanted to play in the fountain. She ran and jumped in the water, getting all wet.
Suddenly, Lily saw a lady with a big box. The lady said, "Hello little girl, would you like to play a game and maybe receive a prize?" Lily was excited and said, "Yes, please!"
The lady gave Lily a ball and said, "If you can catch this ball three times in a row, you will receive a prize." Lily tried and tried but kept dropping the ball. She was about to give up, but her mommy and daddy encouraged her to keep trying. Finally, on the third try, Lily caught the ball! The lady gave her a prize and said, "You did it! Remember, if you keep trying, you can achieve anything you want." And that was the moral of the story.
