Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She loved going to the fair on Tuesdays as it was so much fun! Every Tuesday she would wake up so excited, and make sure she had all her toys ready to put in her pocket.
The little girl was playing on the swings at the fair when she suddenly heard a loud scream. She looked up and saw a big boy running away from a big balloon. She laughed out loud and the boy saw her.
"I'm sorry I scared you," she said. 
The boy felt much better after that and the two of them quickly became friends. For the rest of the day they played together until the sun started to go down. 
Every Tuesday they would meet up at the fair, and go on all the rides. They both screamed with happiness each time they went down the big slide. 
On the last Tuesday, the little girl was so sad. It was time for her to go home. With a last hug, the two friends said goodbye.
The little girl will always remember their special friendship and all their Tuesdays at the fair.
