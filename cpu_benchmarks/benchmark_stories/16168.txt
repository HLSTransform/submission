One day, a boy called Jack arrived at the park. He was so excited to go outside, but he was calm. He saw lots of things to do - there were swings, slides, and a pond to play in. 
The first thing Jack wanted to do was find a lime. He searched the grass and bushes, but he couldn't find one. Just when he thought he wasn't going to find one, he spotted two limes on the other side of the pond. With a smile, he ran to the pond and scooped up the limes.
Jack had an amazing day playing at the park. He went on the swings, slid down the slide, and even sailed across the pond with his limes. When it was time to go home, Jack was tired but he was happy that he had arrived at the park. He had a calm and peaceful day - and he had found two limes!
