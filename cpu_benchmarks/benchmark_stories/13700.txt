Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He liked to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy saw a big tree in his backyard. He wanted to climb it, but he was too scared. 
His dad came outside and saw Timmy looking at the tree. He said, "Timmy, I can help you climb the tree if you want." Timmy was happy and said yes. His dad was very impressive and climbed the tree easily. 
Timmy felt like a big boy when he climbed the tree with his dad's help. But then, he saw something scary. He saw a big spider on the tree. Timmy was very scared and wanted to come down. 
His dad said, "Don't worry Timmy, I will take care of the spider." But when his dad tried to get the spider, he accidentally fell from the tree and hurt himself. Timmy was very sad and scared. He learned that sometimes things can be dangerous even if they look fun.
