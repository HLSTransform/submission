Mia liked to talk to her velvet bunny. She gave him a name, Max, and told him everything. She told him about her day, her friends, her toys, and her dreams. Max was pale pink, with long ears and a soft nose. He listened to Mia and nodded his head.
One day, Mia was sad. She had a bad day at school. Some kids were mean to her and took her crayons. She ran home and hugged Max. She told him what happened and cried.
Max wanted to help Mia. He thought of a way to make her happy. He said, "Mia, I have a secret. Do you want to hear it?"
Mia looked at Max. She was surprised. She did not know Max could talk. She said, "Yes, please. Tell me your secret."
Max said, "My secret is that I love you very much. You are my best friend. You are kind and smart and brave. You can do anything you want. Don't let the mean kids make you sad. They are wrong. You are right."
Mia smiled. She felt better. She said, "Thank you, Max. I love you too. You are my best friend. You are sweet and funny and wise. You make me happy. You are right. I can do anything I want."
Mia and Max hugged. They felt happy. They talked some more and played. They had a good day.
