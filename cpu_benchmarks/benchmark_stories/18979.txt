Once upon a time, there was a big crane. The crane was very fast. It liked to help people. One day, the crane saw a little boy. The boy was sad because his toy was stuck in a tree.
The fast crane wanted to help the boy. The crane said, "Trust me, I can help you get your toy back." The boy looked at the crane and decided to trust it. The crane stretched its long neck up to the tree. It grabbed the toy with its beak.
The crane gave the toy back to the boy. The boy was very happy. He thanked the fast crane. The crane smiled and said, "You're welcome." From that day on, the boy and the crane became good friends. They played together and had lots of fun.
