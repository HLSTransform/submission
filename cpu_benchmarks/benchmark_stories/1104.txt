One day, a boy was playing in a pond. He was splashing with his hands and feet, having a wonderful time. Suddenly, he saw an interesting something out of the corner of his eye. He looked closer, and found that it was a piece of lumber! He was so excited, because he had never seen something like that before. He reached out his hand and grabbed it. He splashed it around in the pond, making big splashes and making tons of noise. He was having the best time ever! After a while, he decided it was time to put the lumber back in the pond and try something else. He said goodbye to the piece of lumber and went on to play other exciting games.
