Once upon a time, there was a clever lily who loved to sell things. Every day, the lily would take a basket and walk around looking for things to sell. One day, she found a big red apple lying on the ground. She thought if she sold the apple she would make lots of money. So she picked up the apple and put it in her basket and continued her search.
The next thing she found was a beautiful blue flower. She thought it would be perfect to sell, so she put it in the basket too. Finally, she found a small golden bird singing in a tree. She thought the bird was so pretty that it would make a great thing to sell. So she put the bird in the basket too.
When the lily had filled her basket with all the things she wanted to sell, she was ready to go and find someone who would buy her items. She was very excited to see how much money she would make from her sales!
