Once upon a time, there was an ordinary girl called Katie. She was walking down the street one day when she heard someone crying for help. She ran to the rescue, and saw a dog stuck at the top of a tall tree. She wanted to help the dog, so she began to climb the tree. 
But, Katie was not an expert climber, and soon she was unable to go any further. Just then, a man came along with a film. He clambered up the tree and rescued the poor dog. 
Katie cheered, but when the man came down, he was very angry. He said that Katie belonged to a special school and had run away. He said she must now go back with him, and that she would never again be allowed to be so ordinary.
Katie was so sad, and the story sadly ends here.
