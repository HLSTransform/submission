Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very happy because it was his birthday. He knew he would get a big present from his mom and dad.
In the morning, Tim found a big box with a lock on it. His mom said, "Tim, you need to unlock the box to find your present." Tim was excited and used a key to unlock the box. Inside, he found a new shirt.
The shirt was very fit on Tim. He wore it all day and showed it to all his friends. They all liked the shirt and said it was a great present. Tim was very happy and said thank you to his mom and dad. And they all lived happily ever after.
