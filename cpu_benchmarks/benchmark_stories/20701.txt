Once upon a time, there was a smelly guard. He was very big and wore a uniform with lots of shiny buttons. The guard lived outside a castle and he talked loudly.
One day, the guard saw something by the castle walls and he shouted. Then he said, “Stop! Don’t move!”
The guard kept talking, and he said the same thing over and over again. He liked to repeat himself.
The guard kept watching the castle wall, but nothing moved. So, he stopped talking and went back to his post. 
The smelly guard kept guarding the castle and he never stopped repeating himself. He was always ready to shout and protect the castle if necessary.
