One day, a little otter named Ollie wanted to celebrate his birthday. He asked his mom and dad if he could have a party with his friends. They said yes, and helped him make a big cake with fish and berries. They also blew up some balloons and hung them on the trees.
Ollie was very happy and excited. He invited his best friends, Sammy the seal, Lila the beaver, and Finn the dolphin. They all came to his party and brought him presents. They played games, sang songs, and ate cake. Ollie felt very loved and special.
But there was one thing that Ollie wished for more than anything. He wished he could see a rainbow. He had heard stories about how beautiful and colorful rainbows were, but he had never seen one himself. He wondered what it would be like to touch a rainbow, or slide on it, or swim under it.
As the party was ending, Ollie's mom and dad had a surprise for him. They told him to look up at the sky. Ollie did, and he gasped. There, in the sky, was a big, bright, and beautiful rainbow. It was shining with all the colors of the world. Ollie's eyes sparkled with joy.
"Wow! A rainbow! A rainbow for me!" Ollie exclaimed. "How did you do that?"
His mom and dad smiled and hugged him. "We didn't do anything, Ollie. It was a gift from nature. Sometimes, after it rains, the sun and the water make a rainbow. It's a sign of hope and happiness. And today, it's a sign of how much we love you. Happy birthday, Ollie!"
Ollie hugged them back and thanked them. He also thanked his friends for coming to his party and sharing his cake. He felt very lucky and grateful. He had the best birthday ever. He had a sweet cake, a sweet party, and a sweet rainbow. He was a sweet otter.
