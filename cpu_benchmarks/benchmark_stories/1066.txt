Timmy was walking in the park one day. He saw a shiny gold piece next to the bench. He smiled and picked it up. It looked so easy to carry! He was happy to have found it. 
Timmy walked around the park showing off his shiny gold piece to everyone he saw. But as he walked and showed it off, the shiny gold piece started to disappear. He became very sad, and he frowned. 
Suddenly, a nice old man standing next to him saw his frown and asked him why he was sad. Timmy told him about the shiny gold piece and how it had started to disappear. 
The man smiled and said, "That is an easy thing to fix." He then showed Timmy a special trick he had. He took out his handkerchief and rubbed the gold piece back and forth until it glittered again. 
Timmy was so happy, he was grinning from one ear to the other! He thanked the man for being so kind, and ran off to show off his shiny gold piece to all of his friends.
