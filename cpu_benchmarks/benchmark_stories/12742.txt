One day, there were two hungry ears walking in the woods. They were very hungry and looking for food. They saw a big bush with some yummy treats inside. They added the yummy treats to their tummies and felt happy. 
But then, they heard a sound. It was the sound of a scary animal. It was a big grizzly bear! The bear was hungry too, and he wanted the yummy treats in the bush. The ears didn't have time to run away. The bear was able to get the treats. 
The hungry ears were sad. They were extra hungry now. They had nothing to eat and they were afraid of the grizzly bear. They had to go home with empty tummies.
