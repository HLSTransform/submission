Steven was a very dependable boy. He was always talking with his friends and listening to his parents. He enjoyed going to school to learn new things. One day, his teacher had a special lecture. Steven was very excited to hear what his teacher had to say. 
"Class," the teacher began, "today we are going to talk about being dependable. Dependability means doing what we say we will do. We must always be reliable when we make promises." 
The students eagerly listened to the lecture. Steven wasn't sure what dependability really was but he was determined to find out. He asked his teacher questions so he could understand. 
"If I make a promise," Steven asked, "how will I know if I am being dependable?" 
The teacher smiled and said, "If you keep your promise then you are being dependable. It's important to always keep our word!" 
The students all smiled at Steven's question. Steven was proud to have asked such an important question. From then on, Steven was sure to always be dependable.
