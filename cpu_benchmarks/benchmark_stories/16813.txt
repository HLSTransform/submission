Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the sun, but he didn't like to wear his hat. One day, Timmy went outside to play and it was very hot. He didn't wear his hat, and his head started to feel hot too.
Timmy's mom saw him playing outside without his hat and told him that he would suffer if he didn't wear it. Timmy didn't listen and kept playing. Later that day, Timmy got a headache and felt sick. He had to go inside and rest.
Timmy learned that it's important to wear his hat when it's hot outside, so he won't suffer like he did. From that day on, Timmy always wore his hat when he played outside in the sun.
