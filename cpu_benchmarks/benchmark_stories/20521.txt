Once upon a time there was a soldier. He was wearing a big, hot suit and he was walking in the desert. Suddenly, he saw something moving. He was scared so he slapped it with his hand. It was only a little sand bug! The soldier felt bad and said sorry to the bug. He kept walking, but then he heard something else moving. This time it was a snake! The soldier was scared again, so he slapped the snake with his hand and the snake slithered away. The soldier was so hot that he needed a drink of water. He walked for a few more minutes until he reached a lake. Then he jumped in the lake and splashed around. He was so happy to have some cool water and was so glad he had not slapped the lake. He smiled and said “Yay!”
