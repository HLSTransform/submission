Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to dream about space and flying fast in his rocket ship. One night, Timmy had a dream that he was flying through space in his rocket ship.
In his dream, Timmy met an alien named Zork. Zork was friendly, but he needed Timmy's help. Zork's spaceship was broken and he needed Timmy to fix it so he could get back home. Timmy agreed to help and they worked together to fix the spaceship.
But then, a big asteroid came flying towards them! Timmy and Zork had to work fast to avoid it. They were able to dodge the asteroid and Zork's spaceship was fixed. Zork thanked Timmy and gave him a ride back to Earth.
When Timmy woke up, he was so happy about his dream. He told his mom all about it and said that he wants to be an astronaut when he grows up.
