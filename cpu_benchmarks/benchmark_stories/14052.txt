Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. One day, Jack saw something very special in the sky - a shiny planet! Jack was so excited that he couldn't help but shout. He wanted to go up and hang on the planet.
Jack's mum shook her head and said that it was impossible to hang onto a planet and stay there. Jack was sad and asked why he couldn't do it.
Mum explained that the planet was too far away and the task would be too serious for a young boy like Jack. She said that bigger and stronger people had tried and failed in the past.
Jack understood and he decided that he wouldn't attempt to hang onto the planet anytime soon. He also realised that some things can be too difficult, or too serious, for him to handle and that it's better to ask an adult for help.
