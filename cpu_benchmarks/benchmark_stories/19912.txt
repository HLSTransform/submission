Once upon a time, a little gray squirrel was looking for some peanuts to eat. He searched and searched but couldn't find any. Suddenly, he saw a big peanut on the ground! He was so happy and started to eat it. 
As he was munching on the peanut, something strange happened. The peanut started to shake and wiggle! The little squirrel was scared and ran away. But then he looked back and saw that the peanut had cracked open. Inside, he found a little baby bird! 
The little squirrel was so surprised and happy. He took care of the baby bird and they became good friends. From that day on, the little squirrel always looked for peanuts in case there were more surprises waiting to happen.
