Once upon a time, there was a big, big dog. He was so huge that he could barely fit in his doghouse. One day, he saw a cartoon on TV and he loved it so much that he sat there for hours and hours watching it. But then, his owner had to leave and turn off the TV. The dog was sad that he couldn't watch his favorite cartoon anymore. But then, he remembered that he had a big bone to chew on, so he left the TV room and went to his doghouse to enjoy his bone. The end.
