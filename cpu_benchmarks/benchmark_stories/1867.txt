Once upon a time there were two friends named Jack and Jill. They both wanted to go on a march together. Jack said, "Let's go march!" So the two friends began the march and they were feeling so excited. 
As they were walking, Jack stopped and said to Jill, "Let's pause for a bit", and so they did. They paused for a few minutes and caught their breath. 
Jill said, "Let's keep going! We can do it!" Jack replied, "Yes we can! We should be honest and keep walking". So the friends kept walking until they reached the end of the march. 
At the end, Jack smiled at Jill and said "That was a good march, friend". Jill smiled and said, "Yes, that was an honest march". 
The two friends walked all the way home, excited that they had marched together.
