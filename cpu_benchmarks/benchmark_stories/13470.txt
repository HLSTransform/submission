Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her cards. She had a lot of cards with numbers on them. One day, Lily's friend came to play with her. Her friend wanted to play with Lily's cards, but Lily didn't want to share them. 
Her friend was very sad and went home. Lily felt terrible for not sharing her cards. She realized that it was not nice to keep things to herself. The next day, Lily went to her friend's house with a new card as a gift. Her friend was very happy and they played together all day. 
Lily learned that sharing is important and makes her feel good. From that day on, she always shared her cards with her friends. The end.
