Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to fold paper into fun shapes. One day, Lucy made a beautiful paper butterfly. She showed it to her friend, Tom. Tom was envious of Lucy's butterfly.
"I want to make a butterfly too," said Tom. Lucy smiled and said, "I can teach you how to fold one." Tom was very happy. They sat down and started folding paper butterflies together.
After they made many butterflies, Lucy's mom called them for a treat. She had made hot cocoa for them to drink. Tom and Lucy were so happy to drink the warm cocoa. But, Tom spilled his cocoa on his butterfly.
"Oh no! My butterfly is ruined!" cried Tom. Lucy saw that Tom was sad. She had an idea. "Don't worry, Tom. We can make a new one together." Tom smiled, and they folded a new butterfly. In the end, they were both happy with their beautiful butterflies.
