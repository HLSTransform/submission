Sara and Ben like to play with colors. They have many crayons and paints. They can make different pictures with them. One day, they want to make a picture of a big pink castle.
"How do we make pink?" Sara asks Ben.
"We mix red and white," Ben says. He shows Sara how to mix the paints with a brush. "See? It is pink now."
Sara nods. She dips her brush in the pink paint and starts to draw the castle. She makes a big door, some windows, and a flag. Ben helps her with the towers and the walls.
They are happy with their picture. They show it to their mom.
"Wow, what a beautiful castle!" Mom says. "Where is it?"
"It is in a distant land," Sara says. "Far, far away."
"Can we go there?" Ben asks.
"Maybe in your dreams," Mom says. She smiles and hugs them. "You are very creative and talented. I love your picture."
