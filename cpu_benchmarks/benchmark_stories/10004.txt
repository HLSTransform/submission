Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play by the river. One day, while she was playing, she saw a charming otter swimming in the water. Lily was so happy to see the otter and she said, "Hello, Mr. Otter! You are so charming!"
The otter replied, "Hello, Lily! I need your help. My home is in trouble and I don't know what to do."
Lily asked, "What's wrong with your home, Mr. Otter?"
The otter said, "My dam is broken and the water is flooding my home. Can you help me solve this problem?"
Lily thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea! Let's build a new dam together!" So, they worked together and built a new dam to stop the water from flooding the otter's home. The otter was so happy and said, "Thank you, Lily! You are my hero!" From that day on, Lily and the charming otter became the best of friends.
