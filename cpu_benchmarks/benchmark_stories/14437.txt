Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved cars and liked to play with his toy motor. One day, Timmy went to the park and saw a colorful butterfly. He wanted to catch it, so he raised his hand and tried to grab it. But the butterfly flew away. 
Timmy was sad, but then he saw a big truck with a colorful picture on it. The truck had a big motor and made a loud noise. Timmy was so excited and ran over to see it. The driver saw Timmy and raised his hand to wave hello. Timmy smiled and waved back. 
Timmy had a fun day at the park, playing with his toy motor and watching the colorful trucks drive by. He even saw another butterfly and this time, he didn't try to catch it. He just raised his hand to wave hello.
