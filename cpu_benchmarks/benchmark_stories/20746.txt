Once upon a time, there was a pond. It was a nice pond, with lots of fish swimming around in it.
One day, a little boy decided he wanted to splash in the pond. He ran to it, kicked off his shoes and jumped in! He was having so much fun splashing around.
Suddenly, he heard a terrible sound. It was a mean crocodile! The crocodile was angry and scaring the fish away. The little boy was very scared, he started to cry.
The crocodile heard him and started to splash the little boy. The little boy was too scared to move - he just put his hands over his eyes. Luckily, his mom came and rescued him. She shouted at the crocodile and it ran away.
The little boy was so happy to be safe again. He and his mom went home and he never splashed in the pond again.
