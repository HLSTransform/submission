Once upon a time, a little boy named Jack went to visit his grandpa on the farm. Jack loved to play with the animals, especially the big bull. One day, it started to rain and Jack got all wet. He ran to his grandpa and said, "Grandpa, I'm wet! Can you wrap me in a towel?" 
Grandpa said, "Sure thing, Jack. Let's go inside and get you dry." They went inside the farmhouse and Grandpa wrapped Jack in a warm towel. Jack felt much better now. 
Then, Grandpa said, "Jack, do you want to help me wrap some presents for your grandma's birthday?" Jack was excited and said, "Yes, please!" They went to the living room and started to wrap the presents. Jack was having so much fun. 
After they finished, Jack said, "Grandpa, can we go see the bull now?" Grandpa said, "Of course, let's go!" They went outside and saw the big bull. Jack said, "Wow, he's so big!" Grandpa said, "Yes, he is. But he's also very gentle. We have to be careful around him." Jack said, "Okay, Grandpa. I will be careful." They spent the rest of the day playing with the animals and having fun on the farm.
