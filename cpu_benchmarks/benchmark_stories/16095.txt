Once upon a time there was a beautiful log in the forest. Every day a little squirrel kept visiting the log. He used to keep a close watch on it because he loved it.
One day the little squirrel was overjoyed to see the log and hugged it. At that moment, he did not notice the big, scary bear. The bear did not like how the squirrel was hugging the log and he started to growl.
The little squirrel got scared and said, “Please don’t hurt me! I’m just trying to keep the log safe.” 
But the bear didn’t care. He roared loudly and snatched the log away from the squirrel. The poor little squirrel was sad and helpless and he ran away, never to see the beautiful log again.
