Once upon a time, there was a big, green crocodile who lived in a swamp. He was very scary and had lots of sharp teeth. One day, a little girl was walking by the swamp and saw the crocodile. She was so scared that she ran away as fast as she could.
But then, a kind man came along and saw the little girl crying. He asked her what was wrong and she told him about the crazy crocodile. The man knew just what to do - he went to the store and bought some special polish.
When he got back to the swamp, he used the polish to make the crocodile's teeth shiny and clean. The crocodile was so happy that he stopped being scary and became friends with the little girl. From then on, they would play together every day and have lots of fun.
