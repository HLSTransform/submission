There was once a little girl named Lila. She was three years old, and she was very excited to learn. One day, her teacher asked her a question: what was her favorite number? Lila nodded her head and said "five!" Her teacher was very surprised and said, "wow, you already know your favorite number!" Lila smiled and was very proud.
The next day, Lila got upset when she saw a new student in her class. He was also three, but he didn't know his favorite number. Lila gave him a friendly nod and said "it's okay! Just pick a number and you'll be fine!" The new student was thankful for Lila's kindness, so he chose the number seven.
Lila was proud that she was able to help the new student, and she promised herself to be kind to everyone she met. Every time she saw the new student, she would nod and show him her number five card.
The new student soon discovered his favorite number and Lila was very happy for him. They both agreed that number five was a great number and they continued to be friends for a long time.
