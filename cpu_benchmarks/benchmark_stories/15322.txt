Once upon a time, there was a nosy nurse who liked to mark things. She marked every day with a big red marker.
One day, the nurse was in the park when she saw a little 3 year old boy playing. She was very nosy and wanted to mark the boy.
So, the nosy nurse took out her big red marker and started to mark the boy's face. The boy cried, and then ran away. The nosy nurse felt bad, but she thought she was just doing her job.
The next day the nosy nurse went back to the park, but the boy was gone. All she saw was a piece of paper on the ground marked with the same big red marker. It had a message written on it:
"Please don't be so nosy. Remember, everyone needs some privacy. :)" 
The nosy nurse learned her lesson and never used her big red marker to mark anyone else ever again.
