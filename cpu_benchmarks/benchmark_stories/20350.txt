Lily hated clowns. She hated their big red noses, their silly clothes, and their loud laughs. She hated how they made funny faces and threw pies at each other. She hated how they scared her with their balloons and tricks.
One day, Lily had to go to a birthday party. She did not want to go, but her mom said she had to. She said it would be fun and there would be cake and games. Lily hoped there would be no clowns.
But when she got to the party, she saw a big pink clown. He had a pink wig, a pink suit, and a pink bike. He smiled at Lily and said, "Hi, little girl! Do you want to see a magic trick?"
Lily shook her head and ran away. She hid behind a table and cried. She did not like the pink clown. She did not like magic tricks. She wanted to go home.
The pink clown saw Lily crying and felt sad. He did not want to make her cry. He wanted to make her happy. He walked over to her and said, "I'm sorry, little girl. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm a nice clown. I like to make people laugh. Do you want to be my friend?"
Lily looked at the pink clown. He did not look so scary anymore. He looked kind and sad. He had a big pink heart on his chest. Lily felt sorry for him. She said, "OK, I'll be your friend. But no magic tricks, OK?"
The pink clown nodded and smiled. He said, "OK, no magic tricks. How about a hug?"
Lily nodded and smiled. She gave the pink clown a hug. He gave her a hug back. He said, "Thank you, little girl. You made me happy."
Lily said, "You're welcome, pink clown. You made me happy, too."
They became friends and played together. Lily learned that clowns were not so bad. She learned that pink was not so bad. She learned that sometimes, things that you hate can become things that you love.
