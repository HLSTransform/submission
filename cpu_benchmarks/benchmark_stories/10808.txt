Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had a stuffed owl that she loved to play with. One day, Lily's mommy asked her if she wanted to go for a walk in the park. Lily was very excited and said, "Yes, mommy! Can I bring my owl with me?"
Mommy smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. Your owl is very healthy and loves to go on walks with us." So, Lily grabbed her owl and they all went to the park.
As they walked, Lily saw a real owl sleeping on a branch. She pointed and said, "Look mommy, an owl! It's sleeping." Mommy said, "Yes, owls sleep during the day and are awake at night."
Lily was happy to see the owl and her stuffed owl was happy too. They all had a fun day in the park together.
