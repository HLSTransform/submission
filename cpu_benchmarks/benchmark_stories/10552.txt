John looked up in the sky. He saw a white dove. He wanted to touch it, but it was too high. Then he had an idea. He wanted to release the dove. So he ran to get help.
John found his mom. He asked her to help him release the dove. His mom smiled. She took John to the park.
At the park, John saw a tree with a big nest. Inside the nest, there were two hungry doves! John was so happy.
He and his mom worked together to release the doves. First, they opened the cage door. Then, the doves flew out of the cage. They flew high in the sky.
John waved his arms as the doves flew away. He was so excited! It was the best day ever.
