Jeff wanted to play a game. He got out his cool watch. But it was broken! Jeff was a little sad because he couldn't play the game.
Then his mom had an idea. She said, “We can take your watch to the shop to get it fixed. Then you can play your game.”
Jeff and his mom drove to the shop. While they were there, Jeff saw some cool new watches and he just had to have one.
After the man in the shop fixed his watch, Jeff was so happy. His mom gave him the new watch as a surprise. He learned a lesson about being careful of his things so that he wouldn't need to get them fixed. 
Jeff thanked his mom for helping him fix his watch. Now he can have fun playing his game with his cool new watch.
