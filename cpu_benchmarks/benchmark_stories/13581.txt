Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie loved to fly high in the sky and see all the pretty things below. One day, Tweetie found a feather on the ground. It was soft and fluffy, and Tweetie thought it was the prettiest thing she had ever seen.
As Tweetie was admiring the feather, a big bird named Bob flew by. "What are you looking at?" Bob asked. "I found this pretty feather," Tweetie replied. "That's just a feather," Bob said, sounding ignorant. "It's not special at all."
Tweetie felt sad, but she didn't let Bob's words bring her down. She continued to admire the feather and flew away, feeling happy to have seen such a beautiful thing.
