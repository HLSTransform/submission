Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a special pillow that she loved very much. The pillow was soft, blue, and had a picture of a tree on it. Lily took her pillow everywhere she went.
One night, Lily went to sleep with her pillow under her head. When she woke up, she saw that it was dark outside. She looked at her pillow and saw that the tree on it started to grow! It grew bigger and bigger, with more leaves and branches.
Lily was so happy to see the tree grow. She played with her pillow all day long, watching the tree grow even more. When the dark night came again, the tree on the pillow stopped growing. Lily hugged her pillow tight and went to sleep, excited to see what new adventures tomorrow would bring.
