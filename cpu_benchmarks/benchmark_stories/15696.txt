Once upon a time, there was a village. The village was filled with happy people, and they always did fun things together.
One day, they needed help to prevent something bad from happening. So, they asked their good friend Bobo to help them. Bobo said he would try his best.
He went to work right away. First, he made a big bucket and filled it with water. The villagers were amazed at how useful the bucket was!
Suddenly, the bad thing started to come and the villagers got scared. But, Bobo shouted "Don't worry!" He used the bucket to pour water and prevent the bad thing from coming.
The villagers cheered and thanked Bobo for saving them. From that day on, Bobo was known as the village hero.
