Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, she found a shiny oyster on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friends. They were amazed by how pretty it was.
Lily wanted to keep the oyster safe, so she put it in her pocket. She trusted that it would stay there until she got home. When she got home, she put the oyster on her regular shelf. Every day, she would look at the oyster and remember how much fun she had with her friends.
Years went by and Lily grew up, but she still had the oyster on her shelf. She still trusted that it would stay there, just like she did when she was a little girl. The oyster became a special memory for her and she never forgot the day she found it in the park.
