Tom is a boy who likes to help his dad. His dad is a mailman who delivers letters and packages to many houses. Sometimes, Tom goes with his dad in the big truck and helps him carry the mail.
One day, they are driving on a road near the woods. Tom sees a fox running across the road. The fox is red and fluffy and has a long tail. Tom thinks the fox is pretty and wants to pet it.
"Dad, look, a fox!" Tom says.
"I see it, Tom. It's a wild animal, so we can't touch it. It might bite us or run away," his dad says.
"But I want to be its friend. Can we give it some mail?" Tom asks.
His dad laughs. "Mail is for people, not for animals. The fox doesn't need mail. It needs food and water and a safe place to live."
Tom is sad. He likes mail and thinks the fox would like it too. He looks at the mail in his hands. He sees a package that is small and round and has a picture of a ball on it. He thinks the fox would like to play with the ball.
"Dad, can I deliver this package to the fox?" Tom asks.
His dad looks at the package. He sees that it is for a house that is very far away. He knows that Tom likes to deliver mail, but he also knows that they have to follow the rules.
"Sorry, Tom, but we can't do that. This package belongs to someone else. We have to deliver it to the right address. That's our job," his dad says.
Tom is disappointed. He wants to make the fox happy, but he also wants to do his job well. He puts the package back in the truck and looks out the window. He sees the fox again, hiding behind a tree. The fox looks at him with curious eyes.
Tom smiles and waves at the fox. The fox wags its tail and runs away. Tom feels a little better. He thinks that maybe the fox is not so lonely after all. He thinks that maybe the fox has other friends in the woods. He thinks that maybe he can see the fox again someday.
He turns to his dad and says, "Dad, I'm ready to deliver more mail. Let's go."
His dad smiles and hugs him. He says, "You're a good helper, Tom. And a good friend. Let's go."
