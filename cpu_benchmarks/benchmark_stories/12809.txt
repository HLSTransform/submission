Once there was a little boy, named Jimmy. He was three years old and loved to go on adventures. One day, Jimmy was in the park playing with his friends. He found a passport laying on the ground and eagerly picked it up. When he opened it he noticed it was wet.
Suddenly, his mommy screamed. "Jimmy, that's not yours! Quickly put it back!" Jimmy quickly put the passport back on the ground and ran to his mommy. 
His mommy said, “That passport is a very important item. People use passports to travel to different places. You must never pick something up that is not yours.” 
Jimmy said, “Okay mommy, I'm sorry.” His mommy hugged him and said, “It's alright, just be more careful next time.” 
Jimmy nodded, and he and his mommy continued exploring the park.
