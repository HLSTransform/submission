One day, a little girl was playing in a gloomy pine forest. She saw a bird facing lots of pine needles scattered across the ground. She wanted to help the bird, so she started to organize the needles. She hummed a song and picked up one needle at a time.
The bird watched as the girl worked hard to sort the pine needles into piles. Soon, she had organized the whole forest. The bird chirped with joy and fluttered around the girl. She laughed and smiled at the bird's enthusiasm.
The cheerful scene attracted other animals in the forest. Soon, rabbits and foxes were playing in the orderly piles the the girl had made with the pine needles. Everyone was happy and content in the pine forest.
