Sara liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She painted flowers and birds and stars on paper. She was happy when she painted.
One day, she saw a new scooter in the yard. It was red and shiny. It had big wheels and a horn. Sara wanted to ride the scooter. She asked her mom.
"Mom, can I ride the scooter?" Sara said.
"No, Sara, that is not your scooter. That is Ben's scooter. He is your cousin. He will come to visit us soon. You can play with him and the scooter then." Mom said.
Sara was sad. She did not want to wait. She wanted to ride the scooter now. She had an idea. She took her paints and brushes. She went to the yard. She painted the scooter. She painted it with many colors. She painted flowers and birds and stars on the scooter. She thought it was pretty.
But Ben did not think so. When he came to visit, he saw his scooter. He was angry. He did not like the colors. He did not like the flowers and birds and stars. He thought his scooter was ugly.
"Who did this? Who painted my scooter?" Ben shouted.
"I did. I painted your scooter. I made it pretty." Sara said.
"No, you did not. You made it ugly. You ruined my scooter. I hate you." Ben said.
Sara was shocked. She did not understand. She thought Ben would like her painting. She thought he would be happy. She started to cry.
Mom heard the noise. She came to the yard. She saw the scooter. She saw Sara and Ben. She was not happy.
"Sara, why did you paint Ben's scooter? That was not nice. You should have asked him first. You should have respected his things." Mom said.
"Ben, why did you yell at Sara? That was not nice. You should have been kind. You should have appreciated her effort." Mom said.
Sara and Ben looked at each other. They felt sorry. They said sorry.
"I'm sorry, Sara. I was mean. I know you wanted to make me happy. But I liked my scooter the way it was. Can we wash it?" Ben said.
"I'm sorry, Ben. I was naughty. I know you loved your scooter. I wanted to ride it. Can we share it?" Sara said.
Mom smiled. She hugged them. She helped them wash the scooter. She let them ride it together. They had fun. They became friends. They learned a lesson.
