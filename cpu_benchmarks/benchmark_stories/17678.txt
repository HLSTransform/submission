Once upon a time, there was a jet. It was an empty jet, not one with people inside. But one day, something amazing happened. The jet suddenly bloomed! It was so special, bright colors shone from it like a rainbow.
The jet gradually turned into a giant flower. It was a beautiful flower with lots of petals and a big, colorful center. It was so pretty, everyone around could not stop looking at it.
The flower spread it's beauty everywhere. They joy it spread was like a big, happy hug. Everywhere it bloomed smelled great.
The flower was amazing and everyone who saw it smiled. After some days, it slowly faded back into a jet and flew away. But, it left behind beautiful memories of joy and happiness.
