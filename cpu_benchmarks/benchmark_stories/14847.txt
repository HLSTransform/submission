Once upon a time, a boy named Timmy went for a walk in the park. He saw many trees and flowers on the earth. Suddenly, he found a mysterious box on the ground. He opened it and found a toy car inside.
Timmy played with the car for a while, but then he saw a lady walking by. He decided to yield and let her pass. She smiled and said thank you. Timmy felt happy that he did the right thing.
After the lady left, Timmy continued to play with the car. He drove it around the park, imagining he was on an adventure in a mysterious land. He felt grateful for the earth that gave him a place to play and explore.
