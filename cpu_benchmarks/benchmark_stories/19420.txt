Once there was a boy who was very busy. He was always running around trying to finish his chores and he never had time to play. One day, he couldn't find one of his socks. He searched everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found. He started to worry.
The boy asked his mom if she had seen it. She said no and told him not to worry. Then the boy decided to ask his big sister if she knew where the missing sock was. His sister said she had no idea. The boy started to worry even more.
He looked under the bed, in the closet and even in the washing machine. But still no luck. Just then, his mom walked in and said she had found it. It was behind the dresser. The boy was so happy. He had stopped worrying. The happy boy was glad he didnâ€™t have to worry about the missing sock anymore.
