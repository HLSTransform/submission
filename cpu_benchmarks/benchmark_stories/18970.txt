One day, a little boy named Tim was playing in his room. He wanted to draw a picture for his mom. He took out his crayons and paper. He started to draw a big tree, a happy sun, and a little house. Tim was very happy with his picture.
Tim's big sister, Jane, was in her room. She was trying to load her toys into a box. But the box was too small. Jane was angry. She stomped her foot and said, "I need a bigger box!"
Tim heard Jane and went to her room. He said, "I have a big box you can use!" Jane smiled and said, "Thank you, Tim!" They went to Tim's room and got the big box. Jane could now load all her toys into the box.
Tim showed Jane his picture. Jane said, "Wow, that's a nice picture! Mom will love it!" Tim and Jane went to the living room and gave their mom the picture and the box of toys. Their mom was so happy and proud of them for helping each other.
