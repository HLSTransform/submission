Lily was very happy. She had an invitation to go to Ben's birthday party. She liked Ben. He was kind and funny. He always shared his toys and snacks with her. He was generous.
But Sam was not happy. He did not have an invitation to go to Ben's birthday party. He was jealous of Lily. He wanted to go too. He did not like Ben. He thought Ben was boring and silly. He never played with him. He was mean.
Sam decided to tease Lily. He waited for her outside the classroom. When he saw her, he said, "Lily, Lily, you are so silly. You think Ben likes you, but he does not. He only invited you because he felt sorry for you. He does not want you at his party. He wants you to go away."
Lily felt sad and angry. She did not believe Sam. She knew Ben was her friend. She said, "Sam, Sam, you are so mean. You are lying. Ben does like me. He invited me because he wanted me to have fun. He does not feel sorry for me. He does not want me to go away. He wants you to stop teasing me."
Sam laughed. He did not care. He said, "Lily, Lily, you are so dumb. You do not know anything. Ben is lying. He does not like you. He does not want you to have fun. He does not want you to stop teasing me. He wants you to cry."
Lily felt hurt and scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to go to Ben's party. She wanted to be happy. She did not want to cry. She did not want to listen to Sam. She ran away.
She ran to Ben. He was waiting for her at the gate. He saw her and smiled. He said, "Lily, Lily, you are so sweet. I am glad you are here. I like you. I invited you because I wanted you to have fun. I do not feel sorry for you. I do not want you to go away. I want you to come with me."
Lily felt happy and safe. She believed Ben. She knew he was her friend. She said, "Ben, Ben, you are so kind. I am glad I am here. I like you. I want to have fun. I do not want to go away. I want to come with you."
Ben hugged her. He said, "Lily, Lily, you are so brave. You did not let Sam tease you. You did not cry. You did not listen to him. You ran to me."
Lily hugged him back. She said, "Ben, Ben, you are so generous. You did not let Sam ruin your party. You did not get angry. You did not fight with him. You waited for me."
They walked to the car. They went to Ben's party. They had fun. They ate cake and played games. They laughed and smiled. They were happy. They were friends.
