Lily liked to rock on her chair. It was a big chair with a soft pillow. She rocked and rocked and sang a song. She felt happy and warm.
One day, she heard a loud noise outside. She stopped rocking and looked out the window. She saw a big wolf with yellow eyes. The wolf was angry and hungry. It wanted to eat Lily and her chair.
Lily was scared. She ran to the door and locked it. She hoped the wolf would go away. But the wolf did not go away. It scratched and banged on the door. It howled and growled.
Lily did not know what to do. She wished her mom and dad were home. She wished she had a friend to help her. She looked around and saw her teddy bear. She hugged her teddy bear and whispered, "Please help me, teddy."
The teddy bear heard Lily. It felt sorry for her. It wanted to protect her. It jumped out of her arms and ran to the window. It opened the window and threw itself at the wolf. It bit the wolf's nose and scratched its eyes. It made the wolf cry and run away.
Lily was amazed. She saw her teddy bear chase the wolf. She saw her teddy bear come back to the window. She ran to the window and hugged her teddy bear. She said, "Thank you, teddy. You are my hero. You are my friend."
The teddy bear smiled and cuddled with Lily. They went back to the chair and rocked and rocked. They felt happy and safe. They sang a song. The end.
