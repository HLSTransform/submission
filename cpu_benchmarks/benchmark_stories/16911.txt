Anna and Ben were very happy. They were going on a safari with Mom and Dad. They wanted to see lions and elephants and zebras. They packed their bags and got in the car.
"Are we there yet?" Anna asked.
"Soon, sweetie," Mom said. "We have to drive a long way."
Ben looked out the window. He saw trees and hills and cows. He was bored. He wanted to play with his toy car. He took it out of his bag and made vroom-vroom noises.
"Can I see your car, Ben?" Anna asked.
"No, it's mine," Ben said. He held the car close to his chest.
"Please, Ben, just for a little bit," Anna said.
"No, go away," Ben said. He pushed Anna with his elbow.
Anna started to cry. Mom turned around and saw them.
"Ben, that's not nice. Share your car with Anna," Mom said.
"No, I don't want to," Ben said. He stuck out his tongue.
Mom sighed. She reached for the car. Ben pulled it away. He threw it out of the window.
"Ben, what did you do?" Mom said. She stopped the car.
Ben looked out of the window. He saw his car on the road. He felt sorry. He liked his car.
"I'm sorry, Mom," Ben said. "I didn't mean to."
Mom got out of the car. She ran to get the car. But a big truck came. It ran over the car. The car broke into pieces.
Mom came back to the car. She was sad. She gave Ben a hug.
"I'm sorry, Ben. Your car is gone," Mom said.
Ben started to cry. He lost his car. He wished he had shared it with Anna.
Anna felt sorry for Ben. She gave him a hug.
"It's okay, Ben. I'm sorry I asked for your car," Anna said.
Ben hugged Anna back.
"I'm sorry I was mean to you," Ben said.
Mom smiled. She was proud of Anna and Ben. She gave them both a kiss.
"Let's go, kids. The safari is waiting for us," Mom said.
She started the car. Anna and Ben looked out of the window. They saw a sign that said "Welcome to the Safari Park". They saw lions and elephants and zebras. They forgot about the car. They were excited.
"Look, Mom, look, Dad, animals!" Anna and Ben said.
Mom and Dad smiled. They drove into the park.
They had a lot of fun. They saw many animals. They took pictures. They ate yummy sandwiches. They laughed and played. They had a good day.
