Once there was a family who loved to eat meat. Every day, the father went to the market to provide meat for the family. He chose the lightest meat, so it was very easy for the children to eat.
The father had two children, a girl and a boy. Every day, the family sat at the table and ate the meat. The girl and the boy enjoyed it very much.
One day, the father brought home a special type of meat called chicken. The children got very excited. They ate the chicken and asked for more. After many days, their father was still providing the family with meat. 
The children were very happy and grateful that their father could provide them with the light and delicious meat. They enjoyed it every day.
