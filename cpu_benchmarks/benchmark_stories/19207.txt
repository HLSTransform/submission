Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she went on a walk with her mommy and daddy. They walked through the forest and saw lots of trees and birds.
Suddenly, Lily stumbled on a rock and fell down. She was okay, but she had a little scrape on her knee. Her mommy and daddy hugged her and made her feel better.
As they walked further, they saw a hut in the distance. It was a small house made of wood. They decided to go closer and see what was inside. When they got there, they saw a friendly old man who invited them inside for tea. They had a lovely time and made a new friend that day.
