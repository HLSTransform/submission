Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat pancakes for breakfast. One day, Lily's mom made her pancakes on a big plate. Lily was so happy and started eating right away.
But then, Lily accidentally knocked over the plate and it broke into many pieces. She felt sad and didn't know what to do. Her mom saw what happened and said, "Don't worry, we can reverse this. Let's clean up the pieces and I'll get you a new plate."
Lily was happy again and said, "Thank you, Mommy. I was ignorant and didn't mean to break the plate." Her mom hugged her and said, "It's okay, accidents happen. Let's be more careful next time." And they enjoyed their pancakes together on a new plate.
