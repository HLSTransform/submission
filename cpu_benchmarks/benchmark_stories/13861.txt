Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a model. The model could fly. Tim was very proud of his model. He liked to play with it all day.
One day, Tim went to the park with his model. He wanted to make it fly high in the sky. Tim threw the model up, and it began to fly. It went very high, and Tim was very happy.
But then, something bad happened. The model got stuck in a big tree. Tim was very sad. He could not get his model back. The wind blew, and the model broke. Tim went home with a sad face.
