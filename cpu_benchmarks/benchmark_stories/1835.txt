One day, Jack bounced his ball outside. He was so excited to see it go up and down. Jack's mom saw him bouncing the ball and she wanted to join him. She went to her closet and got out a big bag of powder.
"What is this?" Jack asked.
"It's a special powder," his mom said. "This powder can make you fly like a super hero."
Jack's eyes grew wide. He couldn't believe it. His mom sprinkled some of the fine powder on him, then he bounced his ball. The wind caught the powder, and suddenly, Jack was up in the air with the ball. He squealed with delight. He bounced around in the sky, laughing and feeling like a super hero.
Jack's mom was so proud of her son. She watched him have the time of his life.
"Look, Mom!" Jack shouted with joy. "I'm flying!"
