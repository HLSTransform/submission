Once upon a time there was a girl called Nina. She really loved getting mail. Every day, Nina would look out of her window and wait for the postman. When he arrived she would quickly run outside to get her mail.
One day, Nina received a very special envelope. It was bright and colourful and filled with lots of pictures. When she opened it, there were lots of new toys inside! Nina was so thrilled that she couldn't wait to share the news with her friends.
Nina spread the word to everyone she saw, and soon everyone knew about her special mail. Everyone was very grateful to Nina for sharing her special mail with them.
Nina was so happy that she got to spread the joy of receiving mail with her friends. She would always look forward to getting the mail every day.
