Tom and Sue were hungry. They wanted to eat meat for dinner. But they had no meat at home. They had to go to the shop.
"Let's go to the shop and buy some meat," Tom said to Sue.
"OK, but we have to be alert. There are big dogs on the way. They might chase us and bite us," Sue said to Tom.
They put on their shoes and coats and went out. They walked fast and looked around. They saw some big dogs on the other side of the street. They did not mention them. They did not want to make them angry.
They reached the shop and went inside. They saw a lot of meat on the shelves. They picked one that looked good and juicy. They paid the man and put the meat in a bag.
They were happy. They had meat for dinner. They walked back to their home. They did not see the big dogs. They thought they were safe.
But they were wrong. The big dogs smelled the meat. They followed them quietly. They waited for the right moment to attack.
When Tom and Sue were near their home, they heard a loud bark. They turned around and saw the big dogs running towards them. They were scared. They dropped the bag and ran to their door. They opened it and went inside. They slammed the door and locked it.
The big dogs reached the bag and tore it open. They ate the meat. They were happy. They had meat for dinner.
Tom and Sue looked out the window and saw the big dogs. They were sad. They had no meat for dinner. They wished they had mentioned the big dogs to the man at the shop. Maybe he would have given them a better bag. Or maybe he would have warned them to take a different way. Or maybe he would have helped them to scare the big dogs away.
They learned a lesson. They should always be alert and mention the big dogs. They should not take risks for meat. They should be careful and smart. They hoped they would find some more meat tomorrow. They hoped the big dogs would not find them again.
