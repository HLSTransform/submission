One day, Sam was sitting in his room, when he noticed it was getting dark. He wanted to go play, but was afraid it was too dark outside. He remembered he had a flashlight, and he ran to find it. 
He searched everywhere and finally found it in the bottom of a drawer. He took it out and turned it on. But, bad luck! It didn't work. He knew he had to fix the flashlight so he could play outside. 
 
He tried to open up the flashlight, but he couldn't get it open. His mom saw him struggling and came over to help. She showed him how to open the flashlight and what part needed to be fixed. Sam tried a few times, but he couldn't get it to work. 
Finally, Sam's dad came over and showed him how to fix the flashlight. He unscrewed a few parts, replaced a few pieces and put it back together again so it would turn on. 
When it was all fixed, Sam was very happy. He went outside to play, and felt safe and comfortable knowing he had his flashlight to help him see in the dark.
