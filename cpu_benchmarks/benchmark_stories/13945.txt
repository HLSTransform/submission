Once upon a time, there was a horse named Brownie. Brownie lived in a big stable with lots of other horses. One day, Brownie felt very bored. He wanted to do something fun. 
So, Brownie decided to play a game. He wanted to see who could weigh the most. Brownie asked all of his horse friends to step on a big scale. They all took turns weighing themselves. 
When it was Brownie's turn, he was surprised to see that he weighed the most! He felt very proud of himself. Brownie realized that even though he was bored, he could still have fun playing games with his friends.
