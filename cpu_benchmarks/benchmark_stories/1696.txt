Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but her room was always messy. Her mom would say, "Lily, you need to clean up your toys and put them in their right place." But Lily would ignore her mom and continue to play.
One day, Lily's mom got very upset and said, "Lily, if you don't clean up your toys, I will have to drain all the fun out of your room." Lily didn't understand what her mom meant, but she knew it didn't sound good.
So, Lily decided to clean up her toys and put them in an organized way. Her mom was very happy and said, "Lily, you did a great job! Now you can play with your toys in a clean and organized room." Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, Mommy. I don't want you to ignore me anymore." Her mom hugged her and said, "I will never ignore you, my sweet Lily."
