Jen and Sam are friends. They like to play with dolls and cars. One day, they go to a new place. It is a big park with swings and slides. Jen and Sam are happy.
They see a cute dog. It is brown and fluffy. It has a red collar. Jen and Sam want to pet the dog. They run to the dog. But the dog does not like them. It barks and growls. It shows its teeth. Jen and Sam are scared.
"Go away, dog!" Jen says. "We just want to play with you!"
But the dog does not listen. It chases Jen and Sam. They run away. They look for help. They see a man. He is the dog's owner. He has a leash.
"Stop, dog!" the man says. He catches the dog. He puts the leash on the dog. He says sorry to Jen and Sam.
"I'm sorry, kids. My dog is not friendly. He does not like strangers. He is afraid of them. You should not run to him. You should ask me first."
Jen and Sam nod. They understand. They say sorry to the man. They say bye to the dog. They go to another place. They find a nice cat. It is white and soft. It has a blue collar. Jen and Sam pet the cat. The cat likes them. It purrs and rubs. Jen and Sam are happy. They play with the cat. They forget about the dog. They have fun.
