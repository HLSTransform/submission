Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy dolphins in the bathtub. One day, Timmy accidentally dropped one of his dolphins down the drain. He started to weep because he loved his dolphins very much.
Timmy's mom heard him crying and asked, "What's wrong, Timmy?" Timmy replied, "My dolphin is gone. It's bad." His mom hugged him and said, "Don't worry, we'll get it back."
They called a plumber to help them retrieve the dolphin. The plumber was able to fish it out of the drain and give it back to Timmy. Timmy was so happy that he hugged his dolphin tight and said, "I love you, dolphin."
