Once upon a time there was a charming little girl called Lola. She loved to spin very quickly in circles, which made her laugh and giggle. Lola spun around the room so fast her toes flew up into the air!
She kept on spinning and spinning until her toes were all a jumble! She stopped and bent over to try to sort out her toes. But as soon as Lola tried to put them in the right places she started spinning again - just for fun.
When Lola felt ready to slow down, she held out her arms and spun round and round until she came to a stop. She looked down and saw that her toes were all in the right places- a perfect pattern!
Lola kept spinning, happy in the knowledge that her toes looked charming and tidy. She spun and spun and spun, until she was too tired to spin any more. A happy smile filled her face and Lola knew that spinning was her favorite game.
