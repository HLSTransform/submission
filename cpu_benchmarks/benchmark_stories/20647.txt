Once upon a time there was a theater. It was special, because it had a bright and shiny display.
Every day, the children of the neighborhood gathered to watch the display. It was full of colors and movement, and the kids were always filled with joy.
One day, something even more exciting happened! A playful puppet show began to play on the display. 
The children were amazed! They laughed and cheered for the puppets and jumped with happiness.
As the puppet show came to an end, the children were filled with joy. They knew the theater was a very special place, and looked forward to the next time the display was on.
