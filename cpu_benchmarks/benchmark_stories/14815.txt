Tom likes to read books. He reads books about cars, animals, and space. He reads books in his room, in the garden, and in the car. He reads books every day.
One day, Tom finds a new book in his room. It is a big book with a shiny cover. He opens the book and sees many pictures and words. He wants to read the book, but he does not know the words. He asks his mom for help.
"Mom, can you read this book to me?" he says.
"Sure, Tom. What book is it?" his mom says.
She looks at the book and smiles. "This is not a book, Tom. This is a soap box. It has soap inside. You use soap to wash your hands and body."
Tom is confused. He looks at the soap box again. He sees that it is flexible. He can bend it and squeeze it. He feels the soap inside. It is soft and slippery.
"This is not a book. This is a toy!" he says.
He runs to the bathroom and fills the sink with water. He puts the soap box in the water and plays with it. He makes bubbles and shapes with the soap. He has fun with the soap box.
"Tom, what are you doing?" his mom says.
"I am reading the soap box!" he says.
