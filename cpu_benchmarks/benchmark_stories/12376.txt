One day, there was a little girl named Max and she was very happy. She wanted to do something special, so she got some thread from her Mom and made a necklace. She found some colorful beads to make the necklace even more special, and she was so proud of her work.
Max put on the necklace and it made her even happier. She ran to show her Mom and Dad how special it was. Max's Mom was so proud of her and smiled. Max's Dad thought it was very cool and he smiled too.
Max and her family decided to go to the park to play. Everywhere Max went, she wore her special necklace. It made her feel so special and happy.
