Once there was an ant that wanted to go on an adventure, but was too small to climb over the large rocks. So he decided to crawl instead. As he was crawling, he saw a shiny pin on the ground. He got excited and crawled over to it. But as he got closer, he noticed the pin had a sharp point and it seemed dangerous. 
The ant was afraid, but he was also very curious and he wanted to get a closer look. He slowly crawled toward the pin, but suddenly felt a sharp stab of pain in his foot. He had been stabbed by the pin!
The pain was so bad and so bitter. The ant shouted and cried, and he knew he would never be able to go on his adventure now. He could only crawl away sadly, wishing his adventure had ended differently.
