Once there was a boy called Jake. He was small like a button and very restless in the mornings.
One day, he had a funny feeling in his tummy. As soon as he woke up, he felt it rising. It was like a tingly feeling, like a butterfly trying to escape!
Jake tried to ignore it and go back to bed, but the feeling kept getting stronger. He jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen.
There, he found cereal and milk. He quickly ate the cereal and felt better. The funny feeling in his stomach had disappeared, leaving him feeling calm and quiet.
Jake realised that when he was restless and had those funny feelings, all he needed to do was eat something light and he would start to feel better. He smiled and went back to bed for a nice long rest.
