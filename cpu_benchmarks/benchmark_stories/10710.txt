Once upon a time, there was a kid named Timmy. Timmy was very creative and loved to draw. He always showed his drawings to his mom and dad. One day, Timmy's mom told him that she would display his drawings in the living room.
Timmy was very happy and excited. He felt like a famous artist. He told his friend, Billy, about it. Billy was also very happy for Timmy.
But one day, when Timmy came home from school, he saw that his drawings were not in the living room anymore. He asked his mom where they were. She said that she threw them away because they were messy and not good enough.
Timmy was very sad and cried a lot. His friend, Billy, came over to cheer him up, but Timmy was still very upset. From that day on, Timmy did not want to draw anymore.
