Once upon a time there was a tiny little penny. She was small and independent. Every day she enjoyed rolling on the ground and playing with the sunbeams.
One day, the sky got really dark and it started to rain. Drops of water tapped all around the penny. She hurried and rolled as quickly as she could but the rain was too strong. Soon she was very wet, and cold.
The penny lay in the grass, sad and damp. Suddenly a friendly breeze began to blow and the rain started to stop. Slowly, the penny began to dry. She felt warm and happy again.
The penny smiled. She was thankful to the warm breeze for helping her dry. She curled up and rolled down the hill, happy and independent. The sun beamed and the penny enjoyed the rest of her day.
