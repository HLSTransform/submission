One day, a boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. They saw a big, thick tree and sat down under it. Tim looked around and noticed a dessert stand nearby. He asked his mom, "Can we get dessert?"
His mom said, "Yes, but only one." So, Tim went to the stand and got a big ice cream cone. He was very happy.
As Tim walked back to his mom, he tripped on a rock and dropped his ice cream. It fell on the ground and was all dirty. Tim started to cry. His mom came over and said, "I'm sorry, Tim. We can't get another one today." Tim was very sad, and they went home.
