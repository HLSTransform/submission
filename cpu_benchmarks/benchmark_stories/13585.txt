Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a nice teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. While she was playing, she accidentally dropped her teddy bear and didn't notice it. 
When she went back home, she realized that her teddy bear was missing. She looked everywhere for it but couldn't find it. She felt sad because her teddy bear belonged to her and was very special to her. 
The next day, Lily received a letter in the mail. It was from someone who found her teddy bear in the park. The person was nice and wanted to return the teddy bear to Lily. Lily was very happy and grateful to get her teddy bear back. From that day on, she made sure to hold on tight to her teddy bear so it wouldn't get lost again.
