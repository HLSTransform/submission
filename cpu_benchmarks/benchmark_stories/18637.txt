Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved animals and wanted to go on a safari. Her mom said they could go on one soon. 
One day, Lily and her mom went to the zoo. They saw monkeys and lions and even a big elephant. Lily was so excited that she split away from her mom to get a closer look at the animals. 
Her mom got a little crazy and said, "Lily, come back here!" Lily turned around and saw her mom's worried face. "Sorry, Mommy," Lily said. "I just wanted to see the animals up close." 
Her mom smiled and said, "I know you love animals, but we have to stay together. Next time, we'll go on a real safari together." Lily was happy and couldn't wait for their next adventure.
