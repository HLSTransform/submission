Jimmy wanted to play dress-up with his big sister. He watched as she put on some jolly makeup and he grinned with excitement. Although he was only three years old, he wanted to try it too.
His sister handed him a makeup brush and some bright colors. As he blended it on his cheeks, he felt like he was in another world. He seemed to be having lots of fun!
Jimmy then put on some of his sister's clothes and ran around the house. Everyone laughed at how silly he looked. He couldn't help but giggle with joy.
Later that night, Jimmy went to bed. As he fell asleep, he dreamed about playing dress-up with his sister. It had been so much fun! He felt like he was in a magical world where anything seemed possible. It was jolly.
