John went for a walk in the park. It was peaceful and he liked it. He saw a garage and he thought it would be fun to explore. So, he picked up a stick and looked inside. He was so surprised when he saw lots of toys! He saw a green car and a red truck. He wanted to take them both. Then he saw a big jar of jellybeans and he wanted to pick it up and take it home. He couldn't carry everything so he picked his favorite toy, the red truck. He was so excited to have it! He ran all the way home and enjoyed playing with his new truck. He had a peaceful day.
