Mabel was so excited. She had been looking for her lost heel for such a long time. The bitter cold had made it even harder to find. She searched around the garden, peering between the bushes and digging in the mud. Everywhere she looked, there was no sign of her precious lost heel. 
That's when she heard a voice calling out.
"Hey you! I have your lost heel!"
Mabel was very happy and ran over to see a little funny shaped creature holding up her heel in its hand.
"This is my heel! Please give it back," she said. 
The creature shook its head and smiled.
"Not until you solve my riddle. If you do, you can have it back," it said.
Mabel thought hard and eventually came up with an answer.
"The answer is a book!"
The creature smiled and handed her the heel. Mabel was so relieved and thanked the creature for helping her find her heel. She hugged it before running off happily with her heel.
