Once upon a time there was a girl called Jenny. She went to the market with her mom. Jenny saw a vendor selling toys. The vendor was very friendly and had a lot of colourful toys in his store. Jenny was excited to pick out something special. 
She pointed to a toy house, and asked her mom if she could have it. Her mom agreed and they headed over to the vendor. Jenny thanked the vendor in a very polite manner, which made him smile.
The vendor was very thoughtful, and gave Jenny another toy. He said it was a gift. Jenny thanked the vendor again and hugged him. Her mom thanked the vendor for being so kind. 
The vendor was very happy to see Jenny so excited. Jenny thanked the vendor for the third time, and the vendor waved goodbye as she and her mom went home. Jenny was so happy with the two toys she had gotten from the vendor. 
The end.
