Anna loved music. She liked to sing and dance and play with her toy piano. She had a music box that her grandma gave her. It had a ballerina inside that spun around when she opened it. It played a pretty song that made Anna happy.
One day, Anna was playing with her music box in her room. She wanted to show it to her friend Lily, who was coming over later. She put it on her bed and went to get her coat. But when she came back, she saw something terrible. Her dog Spot had jumped on her bed and knocked her music box to the floor. It was broken. The ballerina was gone and the song was silent. Anna felt very sad and angry. She yelled at Spot and ran to her mom.
"Mom, mom, Spot broke my music box! It was my favorite thing! It was from grandma! It's ruined!" Anna cried.
"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. Let me see it. Maybe we can fix it." Mom said. She hugged Anna and took the music box. She looked at it carefully. She saw that the ballerina was not missing, but stuck inside. She gently pried it out and put it back in place. She wound up the music box and opened it. The ballerina spun around and the song played again. Anna's eyes lit up. She smiled and clapped her hands.
"Mom, you rescued my music box! You're the best! Thank you, thank you!" Anna said.
"You're welcome, sweetie. I'm glad it's working again. It's a very special music box. I'm sure grandma would want you to enjoy it and share it with your friends." Mom said.
Anna hugged her mom and her music box. She was not sad or angry anymore. She was happy and grateful. She decided to forgive Spot, who looked worried and sorry. She petted him and gave him a treat. She said sorry for yelling at him. She knew he didn't mean to break her music box. He was just curious and playful. She loved him anyway.
Soon, Lily arrived and Anna showed her the music box. They both admired the ballerina and listened to the song. They sang and danced and played with the toy piano. They had a lot of fun with music. Anna was glad she had her music box, her mom, her dog and her friend. She felt very lucky.
