Once upon a time, there was a big house with a lot of rooms. The house was very tall and had a strong structure. One day, a clumsy mouse got inside the house and started running around. The people in the house saw the mouse and tried to catch it, but it was too fast. 
Then, a little girl came and said she could show them how to catch the mouse. She took a piece of cheese and put it in a trap. The mouse smelled the cheese and went inside the trap. The little girl was very happy to have caught the mouse and showed it to everyone. 
From that day on, the people in the house made sure to keep the doors closed so no more clumsy mice could get inside. And the little girl was very proud of herself for showing everyone how to catch the mouse.
