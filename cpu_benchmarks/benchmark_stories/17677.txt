Once there was a nice little boy who lived by the sea. He saw a big, white and beautiful yacht in the harbour and wanted to go on it. He asked his Mommy if he could go, but she said no.
The little boy was very sad. He started to cry. He wanted to go on the yacht so badly and his Mommy wouldn't let him.
But then, suddenly, the yacht started to move and the little boy saw it was sailing right over to him. It stopped right in front of his house and the people on board were waving and smiling.
The little boy was so happy! He had gotten his wish and now he was allowed to go on the beautiful yacht. He had a nice time with the nice people on board. Once the little boy had had enough, he said goodbye to them and the yacht sailed away, back to the harbour.
