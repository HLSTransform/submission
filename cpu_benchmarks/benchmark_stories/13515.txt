Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and collect pebbles. One day, she found a very strong pebble that she wanted to show her friend, Timmy.
Lily ran to Timmy's house and knocked on the door. "Look at this pebble I found!" she said, holding it up for him to see.
Timmy turned the pebble over in his hand and said, "Wow, it's so strong! Where did you find it?"
Lily smiled and said, "I found it by the big tree in the park. Let's go there and find more pebbles together!" So they went to the park and had a fun afternoon collecting pebbles and playing together.
