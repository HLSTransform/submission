Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play basketball. He would dribble the ball and shoot it into the hoop. One day, Timmy's basketball wandered away from him. He looked for it everywhere, but he couldn't find it. Timmy became impatient and started to cry. 
Just then, a kind old man saw Timmy crying and asked him what was wrong. Timmy told him that his basketball had wandered away. The old man smiled and said he would help Timmy find it. They walked around the park and finally found the basketball in a bush. Timmy was so happy and thanked the old man. 
From that day on, Timmy made sure to keep his basketball close to him so it wouldn't wander away again. He learned that it's important to be patient and ask for help when you need it. The end.
