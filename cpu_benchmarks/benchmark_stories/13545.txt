Once upon a time, there was a duck named Ducky. Ducky lived near a pond with his friends. One day, Ducky went to the pond to swim. He saw a frog who looked angry. Ducky asked, "Why are you angry?" The frog replied, "I lost my toy in the pond and I can't find it." Ducky said, "I can help you find it. Let's go look for it together." They searched the pond and Ducky found the toy. The frog was happy and said, "Thank you for showing me where it was." From that day on, Ducky and the frog became good friends.
