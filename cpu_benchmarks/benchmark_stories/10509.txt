Once there was a little girl. She was three years old and very pretty in her pink dress. She loved to play with her toys.
One day she was playing in the living room when she saw a shiny tap. She wanted to touch it. She reached up to touch it but she slipped.
The little girl was sad but then she saw something pink on the floor. It was a pink toy! She had slipped and knocked it out of the toy box.
The little girl was very happy. She loved her new pink toy. She hugged it for a long time.
Then the little girl carefully put the pink toy back into the toy box. She smiled and went back to playing with her other toys.
