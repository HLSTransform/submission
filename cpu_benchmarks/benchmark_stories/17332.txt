Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a big red ball. One day, Lily went on an adventure with her mommy and daddy. They went to a park and brought a map to find their way. Lily's daddy lifted her up so she could see the map too. 
Lily saw all the different paths on the map and was excited to explore them. But then she saw another little girl playing with a toy that she really wanted. She felt jealous and sad. 
But then, Lily's mommy lifted her up and they went to a different part of the park where she found a new toy to play with. Lily was happy again and they all had a fun day together. The end.
