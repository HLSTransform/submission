Once there was a man called Pete. Pete loved to travel so he always ordered a new passport. On Friday morning Pete was so excited to get his new passport. 
Pete ordered the passport online and waited patiently for it to arrive. When it came, it was so nice! The passport was bright blue with a big red stripe.
Pete put his passport in his pocket and went on his way. He knew he was ready to travel the world. Everywhere Pete went he brought his passport so he could show people how nice it was. 
He had so much fun exploring the world! Everywhere he went the passport was admired for being so nice. Pete was happy to have such a special passport.
