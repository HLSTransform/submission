Lily and Ben were playing with their dolls. Lily had a big doll with long hair and a pink dress. Ben had a small doll with a hat and a blue shirt. They liked to make their dolls talk and do things.
"Hello, I am Princess Lily," Lily said, making her doll wave. "I live in a castle and I have a horse."
"Hello, I am Pirate Ben," Ben said, making his doll jump. "I sail on a ship and I have a parrot."
"Can we be friends?" Lily asked.
"Only if you give me your horse," Ben said.
"No, I love my horse. He is mine," Lily said.
"Then I will take it from you," Ben said. He made his doll run towards Lily's doll and poke her eye.
"Ow, that hurts!" Lily said, dropping her doll. "You are mean. Don't poke my doll's eye. She is delicate."
"I don't care. I am a pirate. I do what I want," Ben said. He grabbed Lily's doll and tried to pull it away.
"Give it back!" Lily said. She pulled her doll back and pushed Ben's doll away.
They both started to cry and yell. Their mom heard them and came to see what was wrong.
"What is going on here?" she asked.
"Ben poked my doll's eye and took my horse," Lily said.
"Lily pushed my doll and didn't want to share," Ben said.
Mom looked at the dolls and saw that Lily's doll had a red mark on her eye and Ben's doll had a dent on his hat.
"That is not nice. You should not hurt each other's dolls. They are delicate. You should apologize and play nicely," she said.
Lily and Ben looked at each other and felt sorry.
"I am sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to poke your doll's eye. Can I see your horse?" Ben said.
"I am sorry, Ben. I didn't mean to push your doll. Can I see your parrot?" Lily said.
They hugged and gave each other their dolls. They decided to play together and make their dolls friends.
"Can we go to your castle and ride your horse?" Ben asked.
"Sure, and then we can go to your ship and feed your parrot," Lily said.
They smiled and went to their room. Mom was happy to see them get along. She gave them a kiss and a cookie.
