Once upon a time, there was a large yacht. It was on the big blue sea. In the yacht, there was a boy named Tim and his mom.
One day, Tim's mom said, "Let's cook some food!" So Tim and his mom went to the kitchen. They cooked yummy soup and bread.
As they ate, they saw a fish jump out of the water. Tim laughed and said, "Look, Mom! The fish wants some soup too!" They both smiled and enjoyed their meal on the large yacht.
