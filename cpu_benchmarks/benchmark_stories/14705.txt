Mia and Dad were busy polishing their car. Mia was so excited! She liked to help Dad with his projects. The car shone in the sun, and Mia loved the sound the cloth made when she polished it. Dad smiled at her and said the car was looking really nice.
The next day, Mia and Dad went for a drive. It was cold outside and the car was steaming; it was so cozy! Mia tapped on the dashboard and the sound was so satisfying.
Mia and Dad sang as they drove, and the sound filled the cold air. Dad said that the car was like brand new, thanks to Mia's hard work polishing it. Mia laughed and smiled, feeling so proud of the work she had done.
