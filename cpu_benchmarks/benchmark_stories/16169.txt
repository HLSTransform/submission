Once upon a time there lived a wise old owl. Each day he would search the forest for treasure. Every morning he would take off into the skies and swoop down, looking for something special.
One day, the owl spotted something sparkly. He flew closer and saw it was a golden coin! He flew down and grabbed the coin, then flew into his nest in the treetop.
The owl decided to keep the golden coin as his treasured prize. He kept it safe in his nest and decided to enjoy it the next day. 
The next morning, the owl was so excited to taste the treasure. He flew down from his tree and grabbed the coin, then brought it to his beak. 
The owl took a bite of the golden coin and it was delicious! He could taste the sweetness of the gold. Never before had the wise owl tasted such richness. 
From then on the owl remembered to look for treasure every day, but he never tasted anything so wonderful again.
