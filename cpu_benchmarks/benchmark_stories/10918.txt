Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a pet dog named Max. Max was a great dog. He loved to play fetch and cuddle with Timmy.
One day, Timmy and Max went to the park. They saw a big tree and Timmy asked Max, "Do you want to stand under the tree with me?" Max barked happily and they went to stand under the tree.
As they were standing there, a little girl came up to them. She said, "Wow, your dog is great! Can I pet him?" Timmy said, "Sure!" and the little girl pet Max on the head. Max wagged his tail and licked her hand.
After a while, Timmy and Max went home. Timmy said to Max, "Today was a great day at the park, wasn't it?" Max barked in agreement and they cuddled on the couch together.
