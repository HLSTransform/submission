Once upon a time, there was a little mouse. He lived in a cozy hole in the wall. One day, he saw a big wheel that could spin round and round. The mouse was so nervous to try it, but he wanted to be brave. He climbed up on the wheel and started to spin. Round and round he went, faster and faster. The little mouse felt so brave and happy.
