Once upon a time, there was a little bunny. He was hopping around in the meadow, looking for something fun. He saw a big, shiny slide and hopped over to it. As he put his paw on it, he heard a soft voice say, “Be careful! I’m very fragile.” Startled, the little bunny jumped back and saw a butterfly on a flower near the slide.
The bunny said, “Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to hurt you!”
The butterfly replied, “It’s okay. I just want you to be careful when you go down the slide. It’s very fragile and I don’t want it to break.”
The bunny was very careful as he slid down the slide and then hopped around in the meadow. He made sure to be gentle with the slide and the butterfly. The bunny had a lot of fun exploring and playing in the meadow.
