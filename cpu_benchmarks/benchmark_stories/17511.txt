Tom and Sue were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were spies and look for clues. They had a big lamp that made a lot of light. They used it to see better.
"Look, Sue, I found a paper under the sofa!" Tom said. He showed Sue the paper. It had some writing on it, but they could not read it.
"Maybe it is a secret message!" Sue said. She wanted to see the paper better. She took the lamp and moved it closer to the paper.
But she was not careful. She stepped on the cord of the lamp. The lamp fell down and broke. The light went out. The glass cut Sue's foot. She cried out loud.
"Ow, ow, ow! It hurts! It hurts!" Sue said. She felt something bitter in her mouth. It was blood. She had bitten her tongue.
Tom heard Sue's cry. He ran to her and hugged her. He was scared and sorry.
"I'm sorry, Sue, I'm sorry! Are you okay?" Tom said. He tried to make Sue feel better.
Sue stopped crying. She hugged Tom back. She was still in pain, but she was glad Tom was with her.
"I'm okay, Tom, I'm okay. Don't be sorry. It was an accident." Sue said. She smiled a little.
They heard their mom coming. She heard the noise and came to see what happened. She saw the broken lamp, the paper, and the blood. She was angry and worried.
"What did you do? What is this mess? Are you hurt?" Mom said. She looked at Tom and Sue.
Tom and Sue looked at each other. They knew they were in trouble. But they also knew they were friends. They held hands and told Mom the truth. They hoped Mom would understand.
