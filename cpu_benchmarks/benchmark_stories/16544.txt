Lisa loves to paint. She has many colors and brushes. She paints on paper, on walls, on her face. She paints flowers, animals, stars. She paints every day.
One day, Lisa wants to paint a cookie. She thinks it will be fun and yummy. She finds a cookie in the kitchen. It is round and brown and has chocolate chips. She takes it to her room. She gets her paints and brushes.
She paints the cookie with red, blue, green, yellow. She makes stripes and dots and swirls. She thinks the cookie looks pretty. She wants to eat it. She takes a big bite.
But the cookie does not taste good. It tastes like paint. It is bitter and sour and sticky. Lisa feels uncomfortable. She spits out the cookie. She makes a face. She does not like the cookie. She wants a new cookie.
She runs to the kitchen. She sees her mom. Her mom sees her face. Her face is red, blue, green, yellow. Her mom sees the cookie. The cookie is red, blue, green, yellow. Her mom is surprised. She asks Lisa what she did.
Lisa tells her mom. She says she painted the cookie. She says she wanted to eat it. She says it was bad. She says she is sorry. She says she wants a new cookie.
Her mom hugs her. She says it is okay. She says she loves her. She says she will give her a new cookie. She says she will help her wash her face. She says she will teach her how to paint cookies with icing. She says that will be fun and yummy.
Lisa smiles. She says thank you. She says she loves her mom. She says she wants to learn how to paint cookies with icing. She says that will be fun and yummy. She follows her mom to the sink. She washes her face. She gets a new cookie. She paints it with icing. She eats it. She is happy.
