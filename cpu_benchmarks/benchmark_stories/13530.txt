Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to chew on his favorite toy, a rubber duck. One day, Timmy's mommy told him it was time for bed. Timmy crawled into his regular bed and snuggled under the covers. 
As he lay there, Timmy remembered his rubber duck. He wondered if he could sneak it into bed with him and chew on it some more. Timmy decided to take a chance and grabbed his rubber duck from the toy box. 
Timmy chewed on his rubber duck quietly under the covers until he fell asleep. The next morning, Timmy woke up with a big smile on his face. He had a great night's sleep in his regular bed and his rubber duck was still there waiting for him to chew on again. The end.
