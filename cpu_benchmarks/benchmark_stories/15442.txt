Once upon a time, there was a beautiful bear. He had soft, fluffy fur and he loved playing in the sunshine. One day, he wanted to make something special. He found some sticks and brought them over to his cozy den.
He grabbed some glue and snap, snap, snap he put the sticks together. He was so happy when he finished; It was a beautiful basket! He put it by the window so he could look at it whenever he wanted.
He wanted to make something else so he found some pretty leaves. He took the glue and started to work again. Snap, snap, snap with the leaves, he made a beautiful crown. He put it on his head and smiled.
His afternoon of crafts was lots of fun. He had made two beautiful things using the glue. He was so proud of himself! He was a very clever bear.
