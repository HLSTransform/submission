Once upon a time, there was a rabbit. He was very stubborn and liked to stretch his legs. Every day, he would get up and strech. He would jump high and wide, and even do somersaults. He never got tired of stretching and was so proud of himself. 
One day, a little girl saw the rabbit stretching. She was so happy and decided to join the rabbit. She started stretching too - arms, legs, back and even bouncing on her toes. She had lots of fun stretching and soon the rabbit and the girl were friends. They had a lot of fun together, running and bouncing. 
The rabbit never stopped stretching. He was determined to always stay fit and active. He was so proud of himself when the little girl complimented his stretching and told him how flexible he was. The little girl promised to come back and stretch with the rabbit every day. The two were now best friends and the stubborn rabbit was never happier.
