One day, Jack wanted to explore. He crawled around his living room looking at all the interesting things in it. He saw a big bookcase opposite the window. It was full of books and Jack wanted to find out what was inside. He started to crawl towards it.
As he crawled closer to the bookcase, Jack noticed something. Somebody had been very creative and had used little sticks and stones to make different patterns on the bookcase. Jack touched the patterns and was very amazed at how clever they were.
He continued to crawl around the bookcase and he was amazed at all the things he could see. He spotted different shaped books and he wanted to take a closer look. He started to take out some of the books and flipped through their pages.
Jack had never seen so many words and pictures in one place. He was very curious and wanted to know what the books were about. It was a fun way to explore and Jack was so pleased with his creative investigation.
