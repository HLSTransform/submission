Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small house with her mom and dad. One day, Lily's mom asked her to try a new food - wheat bread. Lily wasn't sure if she would like it, but she decided to try it anyway.
As she took a bite, Lily realized that she really enjoyed the taste of the wheat bread. She told her mom, "This bread is yummy!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Lily. It's a modest bread, but very healthy for you."
Later that day, Lily went to play with her friend, Timmy. Timmy asked her, "What did you do today?" Lily replied, "I tried wheat bread and it was yummy!" Timmy said, "I've never had wheat bread before. What does it taste like?" Lily explained, "It's a modest bread, but it's really good for you. You should try it sometime!"
