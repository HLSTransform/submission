Once upon a time, there was a man who lived all by himself. Every day, he would look out the window of his house. One day, he saw something strange. It was a woman. She looked very happy, but the man did not know who she was. 
He asked his neighbor, but the neighbor said he did not know her. The man began to look for her every day. He looked in parks, in cafes, and in shops. But he could not find her. 
One day, he decided to try one last place. He looked in the temple, and there she was! The man was so shocked, he said hello to the woman. She said hello back and asked him why he was looking for her. The man said, â€œBecause you are my wife!" The woman was very surprised. She had been looking for her husband too! They both were so happy, and the man knew his long search was finally over.
