Once there was a squirrel who wanted to stand. He hopped around, but it was too hard to stand. He wanted to try so he started hopping higher and higher. He said to himself, "I will try."
The squirrel jumped higher and higher until eventually, he was standing on his two little feet! He was so proud of himself and he couldn't help but smile and say, "I did it!"
Suddenly, all the other animals saw that the squirrel was standing. They started laughing and pointing at him, making fun and taunting him. The squirrel felt so embarrassed and sorry. He just wanted to hide away, but he was too scared to move.
The other animals started to encroach on him, getting closer and closer. The squirrel started to feel afraid and he was shaking. He was so scared he couldn't move, and then suddenly, one of the animals swiped his tail, and the poor squirrel fell.
The other animals just laughed and kept taunting him. The squirrel was so sad and sorry. He felt like he didn't have any friends. Eventually, the animals left, but the poor squirrel was still upset. He never wanted to stand again.
