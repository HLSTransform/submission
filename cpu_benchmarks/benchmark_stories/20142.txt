Lily liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She painted on paper, on walls, on boxes, and on her face. She was very independent. She did not want to share or listen to anyone.
One day, Lily found a big cushion in the living room. It was white and soft. She thought it would be fun to paint on it. She took her paints and brushes and sneaked to the cushion. She started to paint flowers and stars and rainbows on the cushion. She was very happy.
But then, her mom came in and saw the cushion. She was very angry. She said, "Lily, what have you done? This is not your cushion. This is grandma's cushion. She gave it to me as a gift. You have ruined it. You have to say sorry and help me clean it."
Lily felt very bad. She did not know it was grandma's cushion. She did not mean to hurt anyone. She said sorry to her mom and tried to help her clean the cushion. But the paint was hard to remove. The cushion was still stained and ugly.
Lily learned a lesson. She learned that being independent does not mean doing whatever she wants. She learned that she has to respect other people's things and feelings. She learned that she has to ask before she paints on something. She learned that painting is fun, but only on the right things.
