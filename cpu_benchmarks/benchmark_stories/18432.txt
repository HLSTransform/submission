Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her backyard. Her backyard had a big green fence that surrounded it. One day, Lily was playing with her ball when it accidentally went over the fence. 
Lily said, "Oh no! My ball is stuck outside the fence. What should I do?" 
Just then, her mom came outside and saw the ball. "Don't worry, Lily. We can get your ball back. Let's twist the fence open a little bit so we can reach it." 
Lily's mom twisted the fence open and Lily was able to grab her ball. She was so happy and said, "Thank you, Mommy. You're the best!" From that day on, Lily made sure to be careful when playing with her ball near the fence.
