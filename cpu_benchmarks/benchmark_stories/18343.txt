Once upon a time, a cute little dog named Spot lived in a small house. Spot loved to play with his red ball. One day, he saw a flame outside his house. Spot was scared, but he knew he had to be brave.
Spot went outside to see what made the flame. He saw a big red fire truck. The firemen were putting out the fire. Spot wanted to guess how they did it. He watched them spray water on the flame. The flame went away and the firemen were happy.
Spot felt proud that he guessed how the firemen put out the flame. The firemen saw Spot and thought he was very cute. They gave him a treat for being brave. Spot went back to his house and played with his red ball, feeling like a hero.
