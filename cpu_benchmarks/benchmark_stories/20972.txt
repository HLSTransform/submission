Once upon a time, there was a bear who wanted to climb the mountain. He was strong and brave, but he was a bit scared too. He wasn't sure if he could make it all the way up.
So, he asked his friends for help. One of them showed him a loop on the side of the mountain. It was a path that he could use to climb to the top. He looked at the loop and felt brave again.
Soon, he had scaled the whole mountain and there at the top, the bear was welcomed by a compassionate stranger. She told him about how she had seen him struggling on the mountain and had been watching him the whole time.
The bear thanked the compassionate stranger and was happy that he had made it to the top of the mountain. He had used the loop to get there. From then on, whenever he had tough times, the bear would always remember the loop. He knew that he could use it again to climb out of any tough situation.
