Once upon a time there was a happy girl. She smiled, laughed, and skipped all day long. One day, the girl wanted to go outside and play. She ran to her mom, and asked if she could go outside. Mom said yes and the girl put on her shoes.
Outside was so much fun! The girl saw some birds singing in their nest. She chased a butterfly and saw some ants walking around. Then, she found a bubble. She stretched out her arms and tried to catch the bubble. It was too high for her to reach.
The girl sighed and looked around. Suddenly, she spotted a big yellow bubble at the top of a tree. She couldn't reach it, so she looked around for something to help her. She found a stick and poked it up high. The bubble moved closer and closer and finally she caught it in her hands. She smiled to herself and started to play. The bubble floated in the air, making it look like it was dancing.
The girl laughed with joy and always remembered that special day.
