The ancient peach tree was standing in the bright, warm sun. Suddenly, a small 3 year old boy stepped up to it and started to cry.
"Oh, why am I so unhappy?" he said in between sobs.
The tree felt deeply moved. After a while a small tender breath of wind blew and the tree spoke to the little boy.
"It's alright, little one. You need to take a deep breath and tell me what's bothering you," said the tree.
The little boy wiped his tears and said. "I wanted to pick some of your delicious peaches, but my mom said 'no'. It makes me so angry!"
The tree smiled and softly said, "I understand. But, you should be glad. I am very ancient and these peaches are not for everyone."
The little boy got quiet for a moment, and smiled. He thanked the tree and went away, happy and satisfied.
