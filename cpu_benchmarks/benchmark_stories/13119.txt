Once there was a little boy named Bob. Bob was very happy and always had a big smile on his face. One day, he found a bin outside and he decided to explore it. Bob opened the bin slowly and carefully. Inside, he was surprised to find a whole bunch of toys. He was so impressed! He quickly started picking out his favourite toys. There were cars and blocks, teddies and even a ball. Bob was jumping with joy! 
He took his new toys home and showed them to his mum. She smiled when she saw all the toys. She asked Bob where he found them and he proudly told her about the bin. Then Bob's mum gave him some sweets as a special treat. Bob smiled with excitement and thanked her.
The next day, Bob went back to the bin to check for more surprises. Sure enough, there were more toys inside - even more impressive ones than before. Bob happily collected them and took them home. 
Bob continued visiting the bin each day. There were always new and exciting things inside. Bob and his mum would smile with happiness every time they opened the bin. It was like they had found a secret treasure!
