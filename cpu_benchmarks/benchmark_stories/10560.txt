Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lily. She always liked to go exploring in her garden, where she could find lots of interesting things. One day, Lily spotted a big cobweb in the garden. She wanted to take a closer look, so she stepped closer and reached out to touch it. 
Suddenly, a rude crow swooped down and grabbed the cobweb! Lily shouted wantingly, but the crow flew away without looking back. "That's not very nice!" Lily said.
Lily was sad the crow had stolen her cobweb, but she decided to make something else instead. She gathered some materials from around the garden and spent the day knitting a beautiful scarf. 
At the end of the day, Lily showed her new scarf off to her mom. "You made this all by yourself?" asked her mom, looking impressed. "Well done, Lily! That's much better than a rude crow stealing cobwebs!" 
And Lily smiled, proud of herself for making something so beautiful from her stolen cobweb.
