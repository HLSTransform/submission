Once upon a time there was a bouncy frog named Jazz. Jazz loved to bounce. Every day he would go to the pond and bounce around, he was the happiest frog around! But one day, the sun went away and it became a dark night. Jazz tried to bounce but he was scared, he didn't like the dark.
Jazz was in big trouble because he knew he wouldn't be able to find his way home. He tried to find someone to help him, but there was no one around. As he was walking, he heard some music coming from the darkness. It was jazz, and he realized it was coming from his pond.
Jazz began to bounce again and he quickly made his way to his pond. When he got there, he was amazed to see all the other frogs, who had been scared of the dark, dancing and playing to the jazz music. He had found his way home! From then on, Jazz always bounced whenever it was dark.
