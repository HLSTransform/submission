Tom and Lily are playful twins. They like to run and jump and play games. One day, they find a big red toy car in the garage. It looks like an ambulance. They think it is fun to pretend to be doctors and help sick people.
They get in the toy car and push the buttons. The toy car makes loud noises and flashes lights. Tom and Lily laugh and drive around the garage. They do not see the big door that is open. They do not see the busy street outside.
A real car is coming fast. It does not see the toy car. It hits the toy car with a big crash. Tom and Lily scream and cry. The toy car breaks into pieces. Tom and Lily are hurt and bleeding.
A real ambulance comes. It makes loud noises and flashes lights. It stops near the toy car. The real doctors get out and run to Tom and Lily. They try to help them. They put them on stretchers and take them to the hospital.
Tom and Lily are very sad and scared. They wish they did not play with the toy car. They wish they listened to their mom and dad. They wish they stayed inside and played with their toys. They think they will never be playful again.
