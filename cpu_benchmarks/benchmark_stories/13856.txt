Once upon a time, there was a normal mole. The mole lived in a hole in the ground. He had many friends, like a bird, a cat, and a dog.
One day, the mole found a big, shiny rock. He did not know what it was, but he thought it was pretty. The mole showed the rock to his friends. They all liked it too.
The mole and his friends learned to value the shiny rock. They played with it every day. The shiny rock made them all very happy. And they lived happily ever after.
