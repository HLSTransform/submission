Once upon a time, there was an old wise bear. He lived in a big tent in the forest. Every day he would do kind things, like giving food to the bunnies. 
One summer evening, he spotted a beautiful butterfly nearby. Usually, butterflies fly away when they see animals, but this time it stayed. The bear thought it was a sign and went closer to the butterfly. He slowly put his hand above the butterfly and the butterfly landed on his finger. 
The bear was so happy, he put his face close to the butterfly and he kissed it! Then he carefully said: "Thank you for teaching me that kindness is always rewarded”. Then the butterfly flew away.
The bear waited a few hours and then he noticed something shining on the ground. He bent down and found a shiny stone that had been left by the butterfly. The bear smiled and said: “Wise butterfly, thank you again!”.
