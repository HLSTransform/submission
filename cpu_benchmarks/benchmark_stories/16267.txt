It was a sunny day and Sammy decided to have a picnic in the backyard. He grabbed his favorite blanket, the blue one with the white spots and spread it on the grass. He wished he could bring his best friend, but he was away visiting his grandparents. He was all by himself.
Sammy started to add food and drinks to the blanket. He added sandwiches and fruit and then he added an ashtray and two sticks. They were his favorite, because they made bubbles when he swished them around and around.
Finally, Sammy added a bottle of soda. He was so excited to take a sip and the bubbly drink tickled his tongue. But then he noticed that the soda was bitter. He didn't understand why it didn't taste how it usually did.
Suddenly, Sammy saw a cloud of smoke blowing in his direction. Before he could react, he sees his dad come around the corner with a cigarette in his hand.
Sammy's dad smiled and said, "Hey Sammy, it looks like you've been busy. I'm sorry you noticed that bitter taste. I'll put this ashtray away now."
