Once upon a time there was a happy kitty. His name was Buster and he loved going on long walks. One sunny day, Buster went to the park to explore. Everywhere he looked he saw something new and exciting.
Soon he came across a lime tree. The oranges were so juicy and bright that Buster got so excited. He reached up to pick a few but they were too high. He looked around and found a stick to help him reach the oranges.
Buster picked three limes and brought them home with him. He shared with his family and they were all so happy. After they ate the limes they were all so excited to go find more.
They went back to the lime tree and picked more limes to take home. Buster was so happy they found the tree. He loved to share the limes with everyone and create happy memories. 
The End.
