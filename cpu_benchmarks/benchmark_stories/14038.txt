Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, Lily's mom was sad because her cake did not turn out well. Lily wanted to make her mom happy again.
Lily had an idea. She said, "Mom, let's make a new cake together!" Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, let's do it!" They went to the kitchen and Lily put on her apron. They got a big bowl and started to mix the cake mix. Lily was very good at mixing.
They put the cake mix into a pan and put it on the stove to bake. While they waited, Lily gave her mom a big hug. When the cake was done, they took it out of the stove. The cake was perfect! Lily's mom was not sad anymore. They were both very happy and enjoyed eating the cake together.
