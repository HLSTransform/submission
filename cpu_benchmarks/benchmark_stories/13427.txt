Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved playing with her dolls. One day, she was playing outside when she saw a big puddle. She wanted to jump in it, but her mom told her not to because it was too cold outside. 
Lily decided to play with her dolls inside instead. She picked up her favorite doll, a pretty one with a pink dress, and started playing with her. Suddenly, her little brother came in and wanted to play too. 
Lily said, "You can play with my doll, but be careful not to freeze her!" Her brother picked up the doll and started playing with her. But then, he accidentally dropped her and her arm broke off. 
Lily got upset and said, "Oh no, my doll doesn't fit anymore!" Her mom came in and saw what happened. She told Lily not to worry and that she could fix the doll's arm. Lily was happy again and thanked her mom for helping her.
