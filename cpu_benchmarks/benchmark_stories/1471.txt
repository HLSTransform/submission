Once there was a sweet hippo who lived in a pond. He loved to dive and swim. Every day he would dive into the water. He would splash and play with the other pond animals.
One day, a large crocodile came to the pond. The hippo was scared and wanted to hide. He quickly he dove under the water. But he was too slow. The crocodile snuck up and grabbed him with his sharp teeth.
The hippo was scared, but he was also brave. He tried to swim away from the crocodile. Using his strong legs, the hippo kicked and tried to escape. After a few moments, the hippo was able to break free and dive down deep.
The hippo swam away and was safe. He swam back to the pond, where he dove and swam to his heart's content, enjoying being sweet and free.
