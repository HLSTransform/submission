Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia was nervous because she had to show her friends the print she made. The print was a picture of a big, red apple. Mia loved apples and she wanted her friends to see her print.
On the day of the show, Mia took her print to school. She was so nervous, her hands were shaking. But her teacher, Miss Rose, told her it would be okay. Mia took a deep breath and showed her friends the print of the big, red apple.
When her friends saw the print, they all smiled and clapped their hands. They loved the print Mia made. Mia was so happy that she started to clap too. Miss Rose was proud of Mia and everyone applauded. Mia was not nervous anymore and she had a great day at school.
