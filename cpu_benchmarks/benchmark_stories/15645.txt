It was a dark night and Eva was tucked up in her bed, looking out the window. Suddenly, a pen flew past the window! Eva jumped out of bed and tip-toed outside, trying to be as quiet as possible. She saw the pen on the ground and picked it up.
Eva heard a voice behind her, "Where did you find that pen?"
Eva spun around. It was her neighbour, Anne. Eva showed Anne the pen and Anne said, "That looks like my pen! I must have dropped it when I was out for a walk."
Eva and Anne walked back inside, and Anne wiped the pen with a cloth to clean it. When it was clean, Anne said, "Thank you for finding my pen Eva. Would you like a present to thank you?" Eva smiled and said, "Yes please!"
Anne handed Eva a big colourful toy. Eva was so happy that she gave Anne a big hug and thanked Anne for the toy. 
The next day, Eva went outside to play with her new toy. She had the best day ever!
