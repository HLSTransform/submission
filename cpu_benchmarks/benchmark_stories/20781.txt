Once upon a time there was an ice cream cone. The cone was round and white and it had beautiful colourful sprinkles all over it.
The cone was very happy with its life, it was glad to be alive. One day it decided to take a stroll in the sun. It felt so good in the warm summer air.
Along the way, the cone saw a cabbage. The cabbage said: "Hey cone, why haven't you melted yet?" The cone replied: "I'm glad that I'm still here, I love the sun!"
But soon the sun became too hot, and the cone started to rot. The cone said sadly: "Oh no, I'm melting away."
The cabbage was sad to see the cone rot away. It said: "Don't worry cone! I will always remember you." The cone smiled and waved goodbye as it melted away.
