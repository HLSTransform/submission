Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. They saw a big tent with a sign that said "Enter here for a surprise". They were curious and excited.
"Let's go and see what's inside!" Lily said.
"OK, but be careful. It might be scary or dangerous," Ben said.
They held hands and walked to the tent. They opened the flap and entered. It was dark and noisy. They heard loud music and strange sounds. They saw bright lights and colorful shapes. They smelled something bad.
"What is this place?" Ben asked.
"I don't know. I don't like it. It's too noisy and smelly," Lily said.
They tried to find the way out, but they got lost. They bumped into people and things. They felt scared and confused. They started to cry.
"Help! Help! We want to go home!" they shouted.
But no one heard them or helped them. They were trapped in the tent.
The tent was a circus. The people and things were clowns and animals and tricks. The bad smell was from the olives that the clowns threw at each other. The clowns thought that Lily and Ben were part of the show. They laughed and teased them. They threw olives at them too.
"Stop it! Stop it! Leave us alone!" Lily and Ben cried.
But the clowns did not stop. They kept throwing olives at them. They hit them in the face and the hair and the clothes. They hurt them and made them dirty. They made them more scared and sad.
Lily and Ben wished they never entered the tent. They wished they stayed in the park. They wished they listened to Ben. They wished they found a surprise that was nice and fun. But they did not. They found a surprise that was bad and mean. They did not like the surprise. They did not like the tent. They did not like the circus. They did not like the olives. They did not like the clowns. They did not like anything. They only liked each other. They hugged each other and hoped that someone would find them and take them home. But no one did. They were stuck in the tent. They were unhappy. The end.
