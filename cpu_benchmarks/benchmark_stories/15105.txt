Once upon a time, there were two little boys. One was named John and the other was named Tim. They were best friends and went everywhere together.
One day, they were playing outside and they saw a big car. "I want to drive it," exclaimed John. Tim agreed and the two boys climbed into the car. 
John started the car and drove down the road, but suddenly a cage flew over the car! In the cage was a fake bird. Both boys started laughing and quickly reached out and caught the cage. 
John then drove them back home and the two boys proudly showed their parents the fake bird in the cage. They had an amazing adventure without leaving home. 
The End.
