Once upon a time, there was a deer. The deer was very tired and needed to rest. But the deer couldn't find a good place to rest. It looked and looked, but all the places were too hard or too bumpy. 
Finally, the deer found a soft spot under a tree. It was perfect for resting. As the deer lay down, it saw an ugly bug crawling on a leaf. The deer didn't like the bug, but it was too tired to do anything about it. 
So, the deer closed its eyes and rested. It felt so much better after a good rest. When it woke up, the ugly bug was gone. The deer was happy to be rested and ready to go on its way.
