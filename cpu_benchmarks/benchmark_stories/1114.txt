Once upon a time, there was a popular bird. He lived in a colourful birdcage in the garden. Every day he hopped around the garden, singing beautiful songs. He was happy in his birdcage.
One day, he decided to jump out. He did a big jump and landed on the grass. He hopped around the garden and sampled different types of food. He was so excited.
But then, a big scary dog came running towards him! The bird was really scared and did a really big jump, flying back into his birdcage.
He was safe but he was a bit sad. He wanted to feel the cool grass beneath his feet and eat different types of food. But most of all, he wanted to be popular again and enjoy his birdcage.
So, he jumped out of his birdcage one more time. He hopped and flew around the garden, singing beautiful songs. Everyone loved him and he was the most popular bird in the garden!
