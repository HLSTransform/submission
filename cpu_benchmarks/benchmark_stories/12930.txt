Once upon a time, there were two friends: Harry and Lola. One day, Lola was playing with a tube in the park. As she was running around, she suddenly slipped and fell! She was so scared.
Harry saw Lola falling and ran over to her. He was so concerned and asked her if she was ok. Lola burst into tears and said she was really scared. 
Harry thought of something to make Lola feel better. He took out the tube and said, "Lola, do you remember when we used to play with this tube in the park? Shall we do it again to remind you it's all ok?"
Lola stopped crying and smiled. She was so glad that Harry could make her feel better. And soon enough, they were playing with the tube again. They had lots of fun! 
The friends were happy to be together, and from that day on, they always remind each other that everything is ok.
