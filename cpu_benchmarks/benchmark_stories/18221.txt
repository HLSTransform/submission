Once upon a time, there was a busy cat named Tom. Tom loved to eat tuna. He would think about tuna all day long.
One day, Tom saw a big can of tuna on the kitchen table. He wanted to eat it so much. But it was not his tuna. Tom thought about it and decided to steal the tuna.
Tom jumped on the table and took the tuna. He ran away to eat it. But then, he felt bad for stealing. So, Tom brought the tuna back and said sorry. From that day, Tom never stole again.
