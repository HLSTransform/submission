Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved plants, especially cactuses. One day, Lily's mom bought her a fake cactus to put in her room. Lily was so happy! She set the fake cactus on her shelf and admired it every day. 
But one day, Lily's cat knocked the fake cactus over and it broke. Lily was sad, but her mom promised to buy her a new one. When they went to the store, Lily found a real cactus that she loved even more than the fake one. She set it on her shelf and took good care of it, watering it every week. 
Now Lily has a real cactus that she loves and takes care of. She learned that real things are better than fake things. The end.
