Once upon a time, in a peaceful garden, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to ride his bike and play with his friends. One sunny day, Tim saw a big, red tomato growing in the garden.
"Wow! Look at that big tomato!" said Tim to his friend, Sue. Sue came over and looked at the tomato. "It's so big and red!" she said. They both wanted to pick the tomato, but they were too small to reach it.
So Tim had an idea. He got on his bike and rode around the garden, looking for something to help them. He found a long stick and brought it back to Sue. Together, they used the stick to pick the big, red tomato. They were so happy and shared the tomato with all their friends. And they all lived happily ever after in their peaceful garden.
