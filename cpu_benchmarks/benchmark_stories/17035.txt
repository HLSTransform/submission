Lily and Max were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs. They found a big worm and a shiny beetle. They put them in a jar and showed them to their mom.
"Wow, you found some nice friends," mom said. "But you are very dirty. You need to wash your hands and face before lunch."
Lily and Max nodded and ran to the bathroom. They turned on the tap and rubbed their hands with soap. Then they splashed water on their faces. They dried themselves with a towel.
But Lily felt something on her cheek. It was sticky and itchy. She looked in the mirror and saw a red spot. She touched it and it hurt.
"Ow, ow, ow!" she cried. "What is this?"
Max looked at her and saw the spot. He remembered something.
"Oh, Lily, I think you got some lotion on your face," he said. "Remember when we were in mom's room and we saw the bottle on the dresser? I wanted to smell it and I squeezed it too hard. Some lotion came out and it landed on your face. I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you."
Lily was angry and sad. She didn't like the lotion. It made her face uncomfortable. She wanted it to go away.
"Mom, mom, help!" she shouted. "There is lotion on my face and it hurts!"
Mom heard her and came to the bathroom. She saw the spot and the bottle.
"Oh, dear, that's not lotion, that's perfume," she said. "It's not for your skin, it's for your clothes. It can make your skin irritated. Don't worry, I'll help you."
She took a cotton ball and some water and gently wiped the spot. She kissed Lily's cheek and gave her a hug.
"There, there, it's okay," she said. "It will get better soon. Next time, don't touch things that are not yours, okay?"
Lily nodded and said sorry to mom and Max. She learned her lesson. She decided to never play with perfume again. She only wanted to play with bugs.
