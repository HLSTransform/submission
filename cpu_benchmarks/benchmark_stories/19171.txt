One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a big tree with unusual leaves. Tim wanted to find more leaves like that. So, he started to search under the tree.
While searching, Tim found a small bug in the grass. The bug said, "Hi, I am Bob the Bug. What are you looking for?" Tim said, "I am looking for unusual leaves like the ones on this tree." Bob the Bug said, "I can help you find them!"
Together, Tim and Bob the Bug searched in the grass. They found many unusual leaves. Tim was very happy. He said, "Thank you, Bob the Bug!" Bob the Bug said, "You're welcome, Tim! I had fun helping you!" They both smiled and played in the park with the unusual leaves.
