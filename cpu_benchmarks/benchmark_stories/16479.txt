Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a shiny thing in the grass. It is a red diamond. Tom and Lily are very happy. They take the red diamond to their tree house.
"Look at our red diamond!" Tom says. "It is so pretty and bright!"
"Yes, it is!" Lily says. "We are very lucky to find it!"
They put the red diamond in a box. They hide the box under a blanket. They go to play some more.
But a bad man sees them. He follows them to the tree house. He waits until they are gone. He sneaks into the tree house. He finds the box. He takes the red diamond. He runs away.
Tom and Lily come back to the tree house. They want to see their red diamond. But the box is empty. The red diamond is gone.
"Where is our red diamond?" Tom asks. "Who took it?"
"I don't know!" Lily says. "Maybe someone saw it and wanted it!"
Tom and Lily are very sad. They miss their red diamond. They cry and hug each other.
"Maybe we can find another red diamond!" Tom says.
"Maybe!" Lily says. "But we will always remember our first red diamond!"
They go to look for another red diamond. They hope to find one. They hope to be happy again.
