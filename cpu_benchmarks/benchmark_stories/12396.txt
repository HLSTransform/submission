One sunny day, Susie and her mom decided to go on an adventure. Susie jumped up and down, as she was so excited. "Oh mommy, can we march there? Please?" begged Susie. Her mom smiled and said: "Of course, let's go!"
So, they marched in the sunshine. The ground was covered in brown leaves, which crunched under Susie's feet. After a little while, they came across a pond.
"Mommy, can we stop here?" asked Susie. Her mom nodded, so they lay down on the bank. Susie could see the trees above her, and the brown water below her.
Suddenly, Susie noticed something in the water. It was a body marching around! She jumped up, surprised. Suddenly, Susie realised that it was a muskrat! It had little brown eyes and a furry brown body.
As Susie watched, the muskrat marched around the pond. Susie smiled, and started to march with the muskrat too - a little march around the pond. She was glad she had gone on the adventure with her mom, so she could march with the muskrat!
