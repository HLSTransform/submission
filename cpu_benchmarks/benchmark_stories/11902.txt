Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the river near her house. One day, she saw an otter swimming in the river. The otter was so cute and Lily wanted to play with it. 
Lily said, "Hi, little otter! Can we play together?" 
The otter said, "Sure! Let's play!" 
They played together for a while, but then Lily got scared. She said, "Oh no! The water is getting deep and scary!" 
The otter said, "Don't worry, I'll help you!" 
But Lily was too scared and ran away. She regretted leaving the otter alone. 
The next day, Lily went back to the river to find the otter, but it was nowhere to be found. She felt sad and regretted not playing with the otter more. From that day on, Lily always remembered to be brave and not run away from scary things.
