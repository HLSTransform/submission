Once upon a time, there was a clumsy little girl named Lily. She loved olives and always ate them with her dinner. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help set the table for dinner. Lily was excited to help and started putting plates and cups on the table.
She saw a big bowl of olives on the counter and wanted to help even more. She tried to carry the bowl to the table, but it was too heavy for her. The bowl slipped out of her hands and spilled all over the floor. 
Lily felt sad and embarrassed. Her mom helped her clean up the mess and told her that accidents happen. She also reminded Lily that sometimes things don't match up the way we want them to. 
The moral of the story is that it's okay to make mistakes and sometimes things don't go as planned. We just have to keep trying and learn from our mistakes.
