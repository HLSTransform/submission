Once upon a time, a little girl went to the beach with her mom. She saw a jellyfish in the water and asked her mom what it was. Her mom said, "That's a jellyfish. It's a sea creature that looks like a big blob."
The little girl thought it looked hard and wanted to touch it. Her mom told her not to touch it because it might sting her. The little girl asked her mom how she knew that and her mom told her that she had learned it from her own mom when she was little.
The little girl's mom told her to always listen when someone tells her not to do something because they want to keep her safe. The little girl nodded her head and said, "Okay, Mommy. I won't touch the hard jellyfish."
