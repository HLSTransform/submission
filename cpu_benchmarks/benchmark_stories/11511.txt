Once upon a time, there was a big toe named Tom. Tom was envious of the other toes because they were always invited to play games. One day, Tom decided to invite his toe friends to play a game with him.
Tom said, "Hey friends, let's play a fun game together!" All the other toes were happy and agreed to play with Tom. They decided to play a game called "Jump the Rock." The toes took turns jumping over a small rock.
As they played, the little toe named Tim jumped too high and landed on the rock. "Ouch!" cried Tim, "I hurt myself!" All the other toes stopped playing and gathered around Tim. They felt sad for him.
In the end, the toes decided not to play "Jump the Rock" anymore. They realized it was not a safe game to play. Tom was sad because his game had caused his friend Tim to get hurt. From that day on, the toes never played "Jump the Rock" again, and Tom learned to be more careful when inviting his friends to play games.
