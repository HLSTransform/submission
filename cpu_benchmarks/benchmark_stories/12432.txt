Once upon a time there was a powerful boat. In the boat was a brave captain and his two best friends. The captain wanted to explore far away lands and find treasures, but his two friends were a bit scared.
The captain said: "Let's imagine flying over the blue sea, beyond the shore and discovering brand new lands filled with hidden treasures." His two friends got excited and imagined the powerful boat soaring over the sea.
Suddenly, the captain said "Look! A shore!" Everyone on the boat was amazed. The captain steered the boat towards land and the three friends jumped off. When they reached the shore there was a big red box waiting for them. Inside was a real treasure!
The three friends hugged and gave high fives. They had found a secret treasure! They all hopped back in the powerful boat and sailed back home. It was a happy ending for all.
