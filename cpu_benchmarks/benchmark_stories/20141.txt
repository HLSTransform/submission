Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the snow. They have great gloves. The gloves are red and warm. They make snowballs and snowmen.
One day, they go to the park with Mom. They see a big hill. They want to slide down the hill. They run to the top. They sit on a sled. They slide down very fast. They laugh and scream.
But when they get to the bottom, Lily sees something. She has only one glove. She looks at her hand. It is cold and wet. She cries. She lost her glove.
Ben sees Lily cry. He feels sad. He wants to help her. He looks around. He sees a trail of snow. He follows the trail. He finds the glove. It is on a tree branch. He takes the glove. He runs back to Lily.
He gives Lily the glove. She smiles. She hugs him. She says thank you. He says you're welcome. They put on their gloves. They hold hands. They go back to Mom. They are happy. They have great gloves.
