Molly was walking in the park. She saw a squirrel, who was looking very bossy perched up on a tree. Molly felt a little scared and shivered. She wanted to get closer and take a better look, but the squirrel was too bossy. 
Suddenly, Molly heard someone call from behind. It was Mary who was also in the park. 
"Hi Molly!" Mary said. "I have some food for the squirrel. Would you like to come and feed it with me?"
Molly smiled and started to walk over to Mary. When the squirrel saw the food, it hopped down from the tree and started eating. Molly and Mary both laughed. Molly was no longer scared, she was so excited to see the squirrel getting all the food. 
At the end of the day, Mary and Molly said goodbye to the squirrel and walked back home. Molly was filled with happiness as she walked away.
