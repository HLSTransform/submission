Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in the sun. One day, the sky turned dark, and rain began to fall. Tim felt sad and started to cry.
"Why are you crying, Tim?" asked his mom. Tim said, "I want to play outside, but the rain is making everything wet." His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, the rain will stop soon, and everything will be dry again."
Tim waited inside, watching the rain fall. After a while, the rain stopped, and the sun came out. The ground was dry, and Tim was happy. He ran outside and played in the sun all day long. And Tim knew that even if it rained again, the sun would always come back to make things dry and fun.
