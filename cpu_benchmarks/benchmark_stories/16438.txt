Lila and Ben were twins who liked to play in the garden. They saw a big peach tree with many ripe peaches. They wanted to pick some and eat them.
"Let's get a basket and a ladder," said Lila.
"OK, but be careful," said Ben.
They got a basket and a ladder and went to the peach tree. They climbed the ladder and picked some peaches. They put them in the basket.
"These peaches are so big and sweet," said Lila. "I wonder how much they weigh."
"Let's find out," said Ben. "We can use the scale in the kitchen."
They climbed down the ladder and carried the basket to the kitchen. They put the basket on the scale and looked at the number.
"Wow, the peaches weigh ten pounds," said Ben.
"That's a lot of peaches," said Lila.
They were happy and proud of their peaches. They wanted to show them to their mom and dad.
But they did not see the dog that was sleeping under the table. The dog woke up and saw the peaches. He liked peaches too. He jumped on the table and knocked over the basket. The peaches rolled all over the floor. The dog barked and chased the peaches. He bit some and made a mess.
Lila and Ben were scared and sad. They cried and ran to their mom and dad.
"Mom, dad, help!" they shouted. "The dog ate our peaches!"
Mom and dad came to the kitchen and saw the dog and the peaches. They were angry and disappointed.
"What have you done?" they asked. "You should not have picked the peaches without asking. You should not have left the basket on the table. You should not have made so much noise. You have wasted the peaches and upset the dog. You are in big trouble."
Lila and Ben felt sorry and ashamed. They wished they had not picked the peaches. They wished they had listened to their mom and dad. They learned a hard lesson. They had to clean up the kitchen and go to bed without dessert. They had a bad ending.
