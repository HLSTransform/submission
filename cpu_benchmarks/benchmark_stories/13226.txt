Once upon a time there was an elderly bird. She was so old that the other birds in the sky looked like they were moving really fast compared to her. She wanted to soar like the other birds but it was hard for her.
So then she went on a journey to find some help. She searched and searched until she found a special tree. The tree was very tall and so the bird had to try really hard to make it to the top.
Finally, when she got to the top, it was amazing. She spread her wings and took off in the sky. She flew and flew and felt the wind on her wings. She was so happy to soar with the other birds. 
The happy bird flew around for many days and even taught other birds how to soar. Everywhere she went people smiled and said hello.
The elderly bird was so proud of what she had accomplished. She had learned to soar, something she thought impossible. Now she could fly high in the sky and be free.
