Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a special toy named Teddy. One day, while playing outside, Lily lost Teddy. She looked everywhere but couldn't find him. She felt very sad.
Lily's mom decided to help her find Teddy. They searched high and low, but Teddy was nowhere to be found. Suddenly, Lily's mom noticed something hidden behind a tree. It was Teddy! He was wrapped in a blanket and had been hiding there all along.
Lily was so happy to have Teddy back. She gave him a big hug and promised to never lose him again. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep Teddy close by her side at all times.
