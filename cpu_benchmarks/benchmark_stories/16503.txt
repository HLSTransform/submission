Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin loved to swim in the big blue ocean. One day, Fin saw a big shark swimming towards him. "Oh no!" cried Fin. "I need to swim away fast!"
Just then, a friendly dolphin named Dolly swam up to Fin. "Don't worry, Fin," said Dolly. "I'll protect you from the shark. Sharks are stupid and don't know how to be nice."
Fin felt safe with Dolly by his side. They swam away from the shark and found a yummy snack of yogurt in a nearby coral reef. "This yogurt is delicious!" said Fin. "Thanks for swimming with me, Dolly."
"No problem, Fin," said Dolly. "I love swimming with my fishy friends." And they swam off into the ocean together, happy and full of yogurt.
