Ben and Mia liked to play hide and seek in the park. They took turns to count and hide. One day, they saw a big boat on the lake. It was unique. It had many colors and shapes on it. It looked like a toy.
"Wow, look at that boat!" Mia said. "It is so pretty and fun!"
"Let's go see it!" Ben said. "Maybe we can hide on it!"
They ran to the boat and climbed on board. They saw many rooms and things on the boat. They decided to hide in different places. Mia hid under a table with a cloth. Ben hid in a closet with some coats.
"Ready or not, here I come!" Mia shouted. She got out of her hiding spot and looked for Ben. She searched the boat, but she could not find him. She called his name, but he did not answer.
"Ben, where are you?" Mia said. "This is not fun anymore!"
She started to feel scared and lonely. She wished she had not left the park. She wanted to go back to her mom and dad.
Meanwhile, Ben heard Mia's voice. He wanted to surprise her, so he stayed quiet in his hiding spot. He thought she would find him soon. He did not know she was scared and lonely. He did not know the boat was about to move.
Suddenly, the boat started to make a loud noise. It began to move on the lake. Ben and Mia felt the boat shake and sway. They both got out of their hiding spots and ran to the deck. They saw the water and the shore. They saw their mom and dad waving and shouting.
"Help! Help!" Ben and Mia cried. "We are on the boat! We want to go back!"
The boat's driver heard their cries. He saw the two children on his boat. He was surprised and angry. He did not know they had sneaked on his boat. He turned the boat around and brought them back to the shore. He scolded them for being naughty and dangerous.
Ben and Mia were sorry and scared. They hugged their mom and dad. They said they were sorry and they would never do it again. They learned their lesson. They decided to play hide and seek in the park, not on the boat.
