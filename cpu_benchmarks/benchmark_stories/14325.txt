One day a dirty squirrel jumped in a seat. It was a comfy seat, so the squirrel stayed there and took a nap. The seat was so comfy that the squirrel slept all day until the night came. 
When the sun went down, the squirrel woke up and looked around. He was surprised to find himself in the seat and he was so dirty from his nap. He jumped out of the seat and ran away.
The squirrel never took a nap in a seat again, but he remembered how comfy it was and told his friends about it. They all agreed that maybe one day it would be nice to take a nap in a seat again â€“ as long as it wasn't too dirty!
