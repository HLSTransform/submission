Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jane and Jack. One day, they were looking for something to do. Jane said to Jack, "Let's make a basket!" Jack thought this was a great idea and they got to work.
First, they found some sticks to make the sides of the basket. Next, they found some grass to weave together the sides. Finally, they added some colorful flowers to decorate.
When the basket was finished, Jack suggested they take it to the park. Jane thought it was a fine idea and they headed off.
At the park, Jack and Jane found a perfect spot by a lake. They put the basket down and started having a lot of fun. They played in the lake and had a picnic in the basket. 
At the end of the day, Jack and Jane agreed that making the basket was a very fine idea!
