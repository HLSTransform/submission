Lily and Tom are playing in the park. They have a ball and a basket. They like to throw the ball into the basket and see who can do it more times.
"Tom, it is my turn now!" Lily says. She wants to throw the ball.
"No, it is not. I want to throw more!" Tom says. He does not want to share.
They start to yell and fight. They are very noisy. The ball falls on the ground and rolls away.
A big dog sees the ball. He runs to get it. He picks it up with his mouth and runs away.
"Hey, that is our ball!" Lily and Tom shout. They run after the dog.
The dog is faster than them. He goes to his owner, who is sitting on a bench. He gives him the ball.
"Good boy, Rex!" the owner says. He pets the dog.
Lily and Tom reach the bench. They are out of breath.
"Excuse me, sir, can we have our ball back?" Lily asks. She is polite.
The owner looks at them. He sees that they are angry and sad.
"Sure, you can have your ball back. But first, I have a question for you," he says. He is friendly.
"What is your question?" Tom asks. He is curious.
"Why were you so noisy and mean to each other? Don't you know that sharing is caring?" the owner asks. He is wise.
Lily and Tom look at each other. They feel ashamed.
"We are sorry, sir. We were selfish and rude. We should have taken turns and played nicely," Lily says. She is sorry.
"Yes, we are sorry. We should have been friends and not enemies," Tom says. He is sorry too.
The owner smiles. He gives them the ball.
"Here you go, kids. I hope you learned your lesson. Now go and have fun, but remember to be kind and respectful," he says. He is nice.
Lily and Tom thank him. They hug the dog. They go back to the basket. They throw the ball and take turns. They laugh and cheer. They are happy. They are friends.
