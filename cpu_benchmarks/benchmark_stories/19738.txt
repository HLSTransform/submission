Once upon a time there was a dependable key. It belonged to a man and the man wanted to test it. So he held up the key and tried to open his door. The key worked! He was so happy. He wanted to test the key again, so he locked the door with the key. When he tried to open the door again with the key, it worked again. The man was very pleased with his dependable key. He put it in his pocket and went to work with a smile on his face.
