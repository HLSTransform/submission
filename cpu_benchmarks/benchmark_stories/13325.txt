One day, a little dog named Spot found a dirty patch on the floor. Spot thought it was a stupid place for a patch to be. He wanted to clean it up, so he went to find his friend, the cat named Whiskers. 
"Whiskers, can you help me clean the patch?" asked Spot. Whiskers nodded and they went to the patch. They worked together to make the patch nice and clean. They were very happy with their work.
Later that day, their friend, a bird named Chirpy, came to visit. Chirpy saw the clean patch and said, "Wow! This patch is so clean! Good job, Spot and Whiskers!" Spot and Whiskers smiled, proud of their hard work. They knew that working together made things better.
