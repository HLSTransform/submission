Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her teddy bear so much that she brought it everywhere she went. One day, Lily and her mommy went to the store to buy some groceries. While they were there, Lily saw a big, shiny toy car on display.
"Mommy, can I have that car?" Lily asked.
"No, sweetie. We can't buy everything we see on display," her mommy replied.
Lily felt sad that she couldn't have the toy car, but her mommy took her to a special place in the store where they could play with some toys for free. Lily forgot all about the toy car and had a lot of fun playing with the toys in the special place.
When they got home, Lily displayed all of her toys in her room, including her teddy bear. She was happy again, knowing that she had a special place for all of her favorite things.
