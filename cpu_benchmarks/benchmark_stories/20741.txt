Once upon a time, there was a brave sailor. He sailed the wide sea in his little boat. One day, he sailed near a lighthouse. The lighthouse was very light and shone in the darkness. Suddenly, a big wave appeared and the sailor was scared.
Suddenly, a magical bird flew out of the lighthouse. It flew down and comforted the sailor. The sailor felt a lot better and smiled.
The bird flew back to the lighthouse and the sailor continued to sail. The sailor thanked the bird and he knew that he was safe.
The sailor made it back to his home safely. He never forgot the light of the lighthouse, or the magical bird that comforted him.
