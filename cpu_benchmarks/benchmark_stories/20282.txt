One day, a messy boy named Tim had a book. He loved to test all the things he read in the book. Tim had a big test at school, but he did not want to study. "I wish I could play," he said.
His mom told him, "If you study now, you will do well on the test." Tim did not listen. He played all day and did not look at the book. The sun went down, and it was time for bed. Tim felt worried about the test.
At school, Tim took the test. He did not know the answers. He was sad. After school, his mom asked, "How did the test go?" Tim said, "I did not do well. Next time, I will study my book."
