The sky was dark and it started to rain. The rain came down hard and the paper got wet. The paper was black and it was splashed with water. All the people around were wet too and they scurried inside to find dry places.
The black paper was wet and heavy. It kept getting wetter and heavier. The rain kept falling and the people stayed dry inside.
After a while the rain stopped falling and the people came out. They picked up the black paper and tried to dry it in the sun. The sun was bright and the paper dried quickly.
The people were happy and they smiled at each other. They grabbed the paper, now dry, and went on their way. The sun was shining and the air was fresh. Everyone was happy that the rain had stopped.
