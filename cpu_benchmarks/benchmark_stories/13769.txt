Lily likes to sign. She signs to her mom and dad, and to her friends at school. She signs hello, thank you, and I love you. She signs when she is happy, sad, or angry. She signs because she cannot hear with her ears, but she can hear with her eyes.
One day, Lily goes to the park with her mom. She sees a big furry hat on a bench. She likes the hat. It is soft and warm. She signs to her mom, "Can I have the hat?" Her mom signs, "No, Lily. The hat belongs to someone else. Maybe they will come back for it."
Lily is sad. She wants the hat. She signs, "Please, mom. Just for a little while." Her mom signs, "No, Lily. It is not nice to take things that are not yours. Come on, let's go play on the swings."
Lily follows her mom, but she looks back at the hat. She thinks it would look nice on her head. She thinks no one will miss it. She thinks maybe she can borrow it and give it back later. She waits until her mom is not looking, and then she runs back to the bench. She grabs the hat and puts it on her head. She feels happy.
But then she hears a loud bark. She turns around and sees a big furry dog. The dog is angry. The dog wants the hat. The hat is his. He jumps on Lily and tries to get the hat. Lily is scared. She screams and signs, "Help, mom!"
Her mom hears her scream and runs to her. She sees the dog and the hat. She signs, "Lily, what did you do? That is the dog's hat. You should not have taken it. You made the dog mad. You could have been hurt."
Lily feels sorry. She signs, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, dog. I did not know. I just liked the hat. Here, you can have it back." She takes off the hat and gives it to the dog. The dog stops barking and wags his tail. He likes his hat. He licks Lily's face. He is not mad anymore.
Lily smiles and signs, "Thank you, dog. You are nice. I'm sorry I took your hat. Can we be friends?" The dog nods and barks. He likes Lily. He signs, "Yes, we can be friends. But next time, ask before you take something. OK?"
Lily nods and signs, "OK. I will. I learned my lesson. I will not take things that are not mine. I will be nice and polite. I will sign, 'May I have it, please?'"
Her mom hugs her and signs, "I'm proud of you, Lily. You made a mistake, but you fixed it. You said sorry and you gave back the hat. You made a new friend. You are a good girl."
Lily hugs her mom and signs, "I love you, mom. You are the best. Can we go play on the swings now?"
Her mom signs, "Yes, we can. Come on, let's go." They walk to the swings, holding hands. The dog follows them, wearing his hat. They are happy. They sign and laugh and play. The end.
