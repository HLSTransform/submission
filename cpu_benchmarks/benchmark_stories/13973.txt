Once upon a time, there was a big, wild lion. The lion lived in a big forest with lots of trees and animals. One day, the lion heard a sound. It was a loud ring! The lion didn't know what it was. 
The lion followed the sound and found a big, beautiful building. It was an opera house. The lion went inside and saw lots of people singing and dancing. The lion loved the music and stayed to watch. 
But then, the lion got scared and started to roar loudly. The people didn't like it and they ran away. The lion was sad and didn't understand why they left. Suddenly, the lion saw a big mirror and saw itself. The lion realized it looked scary and that's why everyone ran away. The lion felt ashamed and left the opera house. 
From that day on, the lion didn't roar loudly anymore. It was a very sad lion because it loved the music at the opera house. The end.
