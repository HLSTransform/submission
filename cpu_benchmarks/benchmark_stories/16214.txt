Once upon a time there was a little girl named Martha. She was 3 years old and lived all alone in a big, empty house. Often when the sun went down, Martha would feel so lonely.
One evening, Martha heard the distant ringing of a telephone. She had never heard that sound before and it made her feel even more alone. She decided she needed to find the ringing.
Martha picked up the telephone from the kitchen counter. “Hello?” She said into it.
On the other end, a voice said, “Hello Martha, this is your grandmother. I’m calling to say hello and to let you know how much I love you.”
Hearing her grandmother’s voice made Martha feel less lonely. She huddled close to the phone and started to giggle with delight. They talked until the sun went down and Martha was feeling much brighter.
