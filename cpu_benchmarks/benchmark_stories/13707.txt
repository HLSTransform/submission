Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was a regular boy who loved to play with his toys. One day, Timmy's mommy asked him to help with the dishwasher. Timmy didn't want to help because he wanted to play.
But then, Timmy heard a strange noise coming from the dishwasher. It sounded like something was stuck inside. Timmy's mommy didn't hear it, so Timmy decided to investigate. He opened the dishwasher and found a big spoon stuck in the blades.
Timmy's mommy was so happy that he found the problem. She thanked him and gave him a big hug. Timmy felt proud of himself for being a good helper. From that day on, he always listened carefully for any strange noises coming from the dishwasher.
