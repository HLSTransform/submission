One day, a tall girl named Lily went to play outside. She liked to skip and jump in the sun. She had a lot of fun when she played.
Lily saw her mom doing yoga in the park. Her mom moved her body in funny ways. Lily thought it looked fun, so she wanted to try it too.
Lily tried to do yoga like her mom. She bent her body and tried to stand on one foot. She wobbled and giggled. Then, Lily skipped back home with her mom. They were happy and had a fun day.
