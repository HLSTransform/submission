Once upon a time there was a big, loud slide. The slide was so big and loud that a young girl who lived nearby heard it. She was so curious that she decided to go check it out. 
When she arrived, she saw a giant, blue coat next to the slide. It was bright and sparkly, and she wanted to try it on. She quickly put the coat on and ran to the slide. 
She climbed to the top of the slide and slid down. The coat was so sparkly and big that, as she slid down, it was like a rainbow! She was so excited that she slid down the slide again and again. 
The more she slid, the more she laughed. Then, suddenly, she heard an even louder noise. It was her mom telling her it was time to go home! She took off the coat, waved goodbye to the slide, and ran to her mom. 
She never forgot her fun day!
