Once upon a time there was a girl called Joan. She was very creative and always liked to explore.
One day, Joan decided to search for a new country. She set off in her boat and sailed across the big blue sea.
Joan saw lots of different lands, but none of them were quite right. She was determined to find something special.
Finally, she spotted an island with a small sandy beach. She beached her boat and stepped onshore. It was magical! She explored the island and found lots of interesting things.
Joan was so excited to have discovered the new country. From then on, she went there often to use her creativity and explore its beauty.
