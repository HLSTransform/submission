Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play in the park. They have a big ball and a small bike. They take turns to kick the ball and ride the bike.
One day, they see a new slide in the park. It is very high and shiny. They want to try it. But they have a problem. Their shoes are too big for the slide. They cannot slide down fast. They get stuck in the middle.
"Tom, this is no fun," Lily says. "We need to change our shoes."
"But we only have one pair of shoes each," Tom says. "How can we change them?"
Lily has an idea. She looks around and sees a bench. On the bench, there are two pairs of shoes. One pair is red and small. The other pair is blue and big. They belong to two other kids who are playing on the swings.
"Look, Tom, those shoes are perfect for us," Lily says. "The red ones are small like our feet. The blue ones are big like our shoes. Let's swap them."
Tom is not sure. He thinks it is not nice to take other people's shoes. But he also wants to slide down fast. He follows Lily to the bench. They take off their shoes and put on the new ones. They leave their shoes on the bench.
They run to the slide. They slide down fast and smooth. They laugh and scream. They have a lot of fun.
But they do not see the other kids coming back. The other kids see their shoes on the bench. They are angry and confused. They do not like their shoes being changed. They look for Lily and Tom.
"Hey, you, stop!" they shout. "Those are our shoes. Give them back!"
Lily and Tom hear the shouts. They are scared. They realize they made a mistake. They get off the slide. They run to the bench. They change their shoes again. They say sorry to the other kids. They hope they are not mad.
They learn a lesson. They do not change other people's shoes again. They are happy with their own shoes. They still play in the park. But they do not go on the slide. They kick the ball and ride the bike. They have fun in their own way.
