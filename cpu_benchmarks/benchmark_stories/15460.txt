Once upon a time, there was a very furry little cat. It was white, grey and black all mixed together and it loved to play outdoors.
One day, the furry little cat was out chasing its favourite butterfly, when it suddenly heard a loud noise.
It was a crane coming down from a very tall tree! The furry little cat was scared and ran away in a hurry.
But then the crane started to strike the ground with its big beak. It looked so strong and fierce, but then it went back to the tree again.
The furry little cat was so relieved that it was safe. From then on, it always stayed a bit further away from the big crane that stayed in the tree.
