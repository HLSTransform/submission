Lily was a flower girl at her aunt's wedding. She wore a pretty dress and a veil on her head. She felt like a princess. She was eager to walk down the aisle and throw petals.
But it was a rainy day. The sky was gray and wet. Lily was sad. She did not want her dress and veil to get wet. She wanted to stay inside and play.
Her mom saw her frown. She hugged her and said, "Don't worry, Lily. The rain will stop soon. And even if it doesn't, you can still be a beautiful flower girl. Your dress and veil are made of special fabric. They will not get wet. They will stay dry."
Lily looked at her mom. She smiled. She trusted her mom. She said, "Okay, mom. I will be a brave flower girl. I will walk down the aisle and throw petals. I will make aunt happy."
The rain did stop. The sun came out. Lily walked down the aisle and threw petals. She saw her aunt in a white dress and a long veil. She looked like a fairy. Lily was happy. She waved at her aunt and said, "I love you, aunt. You are the prettiest bride ever."
