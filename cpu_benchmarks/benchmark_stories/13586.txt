Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and pick flowers. One day, she saw her mommy planting a herb garden. 
Lily asked her mommy what the herb garden was for. Her mommy said that they were special plants that you can use to make food taste better and be healthy. Lily was interested in learning more about herbs.
Her mommy taught her that herbs are like magic plants that can make food yummy and good for you. Lily was excited to try some of the new herbs in her food. She learned that eating healthy can be fun and tasty too!
