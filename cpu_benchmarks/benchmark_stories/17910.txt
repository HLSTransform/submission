Once upon a time there was a really big frog. He was a big and green frog. All the other frogs were so excited to see him! He was so tall and strong. 
The frog liked to take long naps and he was always very sleepy. Even when he was hopping around he would yawn a lot. 
One day the big frog saw a beautiful white butterfly. It was so white and it was flying in the wind. The frog wanted to catch the butterfly and play but it was too fast. 
The frog tried to chase the butterfly but even when he hopped as fast as he could he couldn't catch it. So the frog gave up and he started to yawn again. He was tired from all the jumping and chasing. 
The frog lay down in the grass and soon he was asleep. He dreamed of chasing butterflies in the sunshine forever!
