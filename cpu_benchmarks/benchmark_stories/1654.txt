Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to climb trees. One day, he saw a big wild tree in the forest and wanted to climb it. He asked his mom if he could go and climb the tree, but his mom said no because it was too dangerous. 
Timmy was sad and wanted to climb the tree so badly. He decided to make a fake tree in his backyard with some cardboard and paint. He climbed up the fake tree and pretended he was in the wild forest. 
But then, his little sister came outside and saw him climbing the fake tree. She laughed and said, "That's not a real tree, silly!" Timmy got upset and said, "It's not fake! It's my wild tree!" 
His sister didn't understand why Timmy was so upset, but then she saw how much he loved climbing. She said, "Let's go climb some real trees in the park!" Timmy was so happy and they went to the park together to climb some real trees.
