Once upon a time there lived a little girl who loved to whistle. Every day she would walk around her garden and whistle a melodic tune. One day while she was walking, she heard a sound coming from inside a bush. When she looked closer, she saw a little dish filled with something that looked delicious. She couldn't resist, so she knelt down to take a closer look. 
Suddenly, a voice came from behind her. It said" What do you think you're doing? That's mine!" She turned around to see a little rabbit. "It looks very delicious!" she replied. The rabbit nodded in agreement and then said, "I made it specially for you. Try it and see if you like it." 
The little girl was so excited. Taking a small wooden spoon, she scooped out a bite of the delicious dish and was surprised by the amazing taste. She thanked the rabbit, who smiled in reply. She decided to take the dish home with her. 
As she walked home, she whistled a happy tune, full of gratitude for such a delicious surprise.
