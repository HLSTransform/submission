Henry stared at the wagon. It was big, red and filled with toys. He was impatient to go for a ride. He pulled at it but it wouldn't move. He shouted for help. 
His mom came running over. She put him in the wagon and held the handle. Henry smiled and shouted with joy.
The wagon began to move. Henry watched the houses and trees go by. He waved at some kids he saw playing in a garden.
Suddenly, the wagon stopped. Henry stared ahead. There was an ice cream shop! His mom took out some money and promised him a treat. Henry smiled and was no longer impatient.
