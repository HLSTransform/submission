Once there were two friends who loved to play together. They would play with their dolls every day in the sunshine. One day it started to rain, and it rained very heavily until the area was flooded. The flood separated the two friends, so they couldn't play together anymore. 
The friends were sad and missed each other very much. But then one day the flood stopped, and the sun came out. The friends were so excited that they could be together again. The sun was very bright and the sky was good.
As the water drained away, their dolls floated along until they both reached the same spot. The friends used the sun's energy to dry their dolls, and then they hugged and started playing together again.
The two friends were so happy to be together again that they promised to never be apart no matter what happened. They said if there ever was another flood, they would use the sunshine to bring them back together again.
