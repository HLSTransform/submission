Tom and Mia love to play with their toys. They have many toys, but their favorite is a big penguin. The penguin is soft and black and white. It has a yellow beak and feet. It can make a funny sound when you squeeze it.
One day, Tom and Mia are playing with the penguin in their room. They pretend that the penguin is a superhero who can fly and save the world. They throw the penguin in the air and catch it. They have a lot of fun.
But then, something bad happens. Tom throws the penguin too hard and it hits the wall. The penguin falls to the floor and makes a loud noise. Tom and Mia run to the penguin and see that its beak is broken. The yellow part is hanging from a thread. The penguin does not make any sound.
"Oh no, we broke the penguin!" Mia cries. "We are sorry, penguin. We did not mean to hurt you."
Tom feels sad too. He loves the penguin. He wants to fix it. He thinks of an idea. He runs to the kitchen and gets some glue. He comes back to the room and says to Mia, "I have glue. We can fix the penguin with glue. Glue can stick things together."
Mia nods. She helps Tom to put some glue on the penguin's beak. They press the yellow part back to the white part. They wait for a while. Then they squeeze the penguin and hear its sound. The penguin is fixed!
"Yay, we fixed the penguin!" Tom and Mia cheer. "We are sorry, penguin. We will be more careful next time."
The penguin looks happy too. It makes a funny sound and winks at them. Tom and Mia hug the penguin and give it a kiss. They think the penguin is delicious. They love the penguin. The penguin loves them too. They are happy.
