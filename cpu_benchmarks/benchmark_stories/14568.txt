Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Anna. She was three years old.
One day, Anna went to a restaurant with her family. She was so excited! At the restaurant, there was a big blue menu behind the counter.
Anna peeked at the menu, but it was too difficult for her to read. Instead, she asked her mommy to help her. 
Mommy helped Anna to order one delicious ice cream. It was a big scoop of vanilla in a bright blue bowl.
Anna was so happy! She wanted to try the yummy ice cream. She smiled and said "Delicious!" 
The end.
