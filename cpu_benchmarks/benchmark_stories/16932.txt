Lily likes to play with her zoom. It is a toy car that can go very fast. She likes to make it go on the floor, on the sofa, and on the table. She likes to make it go zoom, zoom, zoom!
One day, Lily cannot find her zoom. She looks under the bed, in the closet, and in the toy box. She cannot see her zoom anywhere. She feels sad and cries. She wants to play with her zoom.
Mommy hears Lily cry and comes to her room. She asks Lily what is wrong. Lily tells Mommy that she cannot find her zoom. Mommy hugs Lily and says, "Don't worry, we will find your zoom together."
Mommy and Lily look for the zoom in the kitchen, in the living room, and in the bathroom. They still cannot find the zoom. Lily feels more sad and cries louder. She thinks she lost her zoom forever.
Then, Mommy sees something shiny on the window sill. She says, "Look, Lily, what is that?" Lily looks and sees her zoom. It is on the window sill, next to a beautiful flower. Lily runs to the window and grabs her zoom. She feels happy and smiles. She says, "Thank you, Mommy, you found my zoom!"
Mommy says, "You're welcome, Lily, I'm glad you found your zoom. It is a beautiful zoom, just like the flower. Do you want to play with your zoom outside?" Lily says, "Yes, Mommy, I want to play with my zoom outside. Can I take the flower too?" Mommy says, "Of course, Lily, you can take the flower too. It is a beautiful flower, just like you." Lily and Mommy go outside and play with the zoom and the flower. They have fun and laugh. They love each other very much.
