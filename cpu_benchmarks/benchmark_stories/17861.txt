Once upon a time, there was a normal fairy living in a forest. The fairy was very small and had beautiful wings. Every day, the fairy would fly around the forest and visit her friends.
One day, the fairy was feeling very sad. She had lost something very important to her. She wanted to get it back, but didn't know where to find it. Suddenly, she saw something rise out of the ground. It was her missing item! She was so happy. 
She grabbed the item and hugged it tightly. Then she rose up in the sky and flew away. She was so happy to have her item back. From then on, the fairy was normal again and flew around the forest with joy.
