One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the store with her mom. They wanted to buy some chocolate. When they got to the store, Lucy saw a big, red chocolate. She asked her mom, "Can I have this one?" Her mom looked at the chocolate and said, "That is a spicy chocolate. Are you sure you want it?"
Lucy thought for a moment and said, "Yes, I want to try it!" So, her mom bought the spicy chocolate for her. When they got home, Lucy took a small bite of the chocolate. She started to feel hot in her mouth. "Oh no, this is too spicy for me!" she said.
Her mom gave her some water to drink. Lucy felt better, but she did not want to eat the spicy chocolate anymore. She decided to remain with her normal chocolate. The next day, Lucy and her mom went back to the store and bought her favorite sweet chocolate. Lucy was happy and told her mom, "I like sweet chocolate better than spicy chocolate!"
