Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch movies with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to the movie theater to watch a new movie. The movie was about a little mouse who wanted to be a chef.
During the movie, Lily's tummy started to grumble. She whispered to her mommy, "I'm hungry." Her mommy replied, "We can get some popcorn and candy soon." Lily smiled and continued to watch the movie.
After the movie, Lily's daddy asked her what she thought of the little mouse. Lily replied, "He was so cute! I want to be a chef too." Her mommy and daddy smiled and told her that she could be anything she wanted to be when she grew up.
