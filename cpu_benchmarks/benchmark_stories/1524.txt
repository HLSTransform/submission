Once upon a time there was a giraffe who wanted to have some yummy treat. So she looked all around for something to eat. She saw a cup full of yummy treats! She was so excited she decided to shoot up into the sky. But as she was flying, she started to feel dizzy. She couldn't see straight and the cup dropped far away. The giraffe felt so sad she wanted to cry. She didn't know what to do, so she asked the kangaroo for help. The kangaroo jumped high and caught the cup just in time! The giraffe was so happy, she hugged the kangaroo and thanked him very much. The kangaroo was pleased and they both enjoyed the yummy treats together.
