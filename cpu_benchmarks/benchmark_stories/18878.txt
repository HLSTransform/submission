Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys, but sometimes they fight. One day, they find a big box of crayons in the living room. They both want to use them.
"Give me the red one!" Tom says. He grabs the crayon from Lily's hand.
"No, it's mine!" Lily says. She tries to get it back.
"Stop it, you are selfish!" Tom says. He pushes Lily away.
"Ow, you hurt me!" Lily says. She starts to cry.
Mother hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She sees Tom and Lily with the crayons.
"What are you doing?" Mother says. She is not happy.
"Tom took my crayon and pushed me!" Lily says.
"Tom, that is not nice. You have to share with your sister. Say sorry to Lily." Mother says.
Tom does not want to say sorry. He thinks Lily is selfish too. He pouts and looks away.
"Tom, if you don't say sorry, you can't use the crayons. You have to be kind and gentle with your sister. She is your friend." Mother says.
Tom thinks for a moment. He likes to use the crayons. He does not want to lose them. He also does not want to make Mother sad. He looks at Lily. She is still crying. He feels a little sorry for her.
"Sorry, Lily." Tom says. He gives her the red crayon.
"Thank you, Tom." Lily says. She smiles and wipes her tears.
Mother is proud of Tom. She hugs him and Lily.
"That's better. Now you can use the crayons together. You can make beautiful pictures. But remember, sharing is caring." Mother says.
Tom and Lily nod. They start to draw with the crayons. They have fun and do not fight. They are happy. Mother is happy too.
