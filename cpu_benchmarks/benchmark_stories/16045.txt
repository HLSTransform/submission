Today, Jack went to the park. He saw a wide open field. He saw some birds in the sky. Jack wondered if he could catch one. He said to his Mom “Can I catch one of the birds?” His Mom replied “I don’t think so, sweetheart. They’re too fast for you.”
But then Jack saw a big, wide butterfly. It was fluttering around like it was trying to get away from something. Jack smiled and said “I’m gonna catch that butterfly!”
Jack ran as fast as he could and finally, he caught the butterfly! He smiled wide and said “I got it!” His Mom was very proud of him.
Jack cupped his hands around the butterfly and said “You’re safe now.” He slowly opened his hands, and the butterfly flew away. Jack said “Bye bye!” and watched until the butterfly was out of sight.
Jack was very happy that he caught the butterfly today.
