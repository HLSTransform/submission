Once, there was a little girl who lived in a tiny house in the woods. She was very brave and loved to explore the woods. One day, as she walked deep into the forest, she heard a loud howling. Looking around, she realised she was close to a pack of wolves. She was afraid, and didn't know what to do. She started to struggle, and thought she was doomed.
Suddenly, the biggest wolf stepped forward. He looked at the little girl, and then said in a gentle and deep voice: "Little girl, why do you struggle? I am a fine and kind wolf, and I will help you." The other wolves laughed and started to play.
The little girl was happy and ran over to the wolf. She thanked him for saving her, and asked if she could stay with him. He let her stay, and they became the best of friends. He showed the little girl the secret paths of the forest and taught her how to find food. Every day, she went exploring with her new wolf friend.
The little girl was so happy she had met the fine wolf, and she thanked him every day. He was always so gentle with her, and she was so grateful. They lived in the woods together, and never had to struggle again.
