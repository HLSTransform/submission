Once upon a time, there was a cute little kid. He was incredibly brave and he always wanted to explore. One day, he saw a dark and scary cave. He wanted to go closer and take a look. He didn't know what he could find.
So he started walking towards the cave. Suddenly, the ground started shaking and the kid was scared. He started running away from the cave as fast as he could. But the ground was shaking so much he was slipping and sliding!
The kid was so brave that he didn't give up. He kept running and running, until the ground stopped shaking. He was relieved and safe.
The kid was so proud of himself that he went back to the cave and took a look around. He couldn't believe his eyes - it was filled with incredible treasures! 
The kid couldn't keep his excitement, and he took some of the treasures back home with him to share with his family.
From that day onwards, the kid was known to be incredibly brave - and the people in the village never stopped thanking him for his incredible discovery!
