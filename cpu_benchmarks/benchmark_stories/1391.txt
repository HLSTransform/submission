Sammy was at the beach with his parents. He watched as the waves rocked against the shore. He was amazed at how lively the ocean was. 
His parents put him on a surfboard and told him to catch a wave. He was scared at first but when he tried it, he felt a rush of excitement. He rocked back and forth with the surf. He felt alive, like he could do anything. 
As he rode the fish, he smiled and laughed. He kept riding the waves, going up and down. More and more surfers started to join him and before he knew it, the beach was filled with people. 
Sammy had a great time. He couldn't believe he got to surf on such a lively beach day. He had never had so much fun in his life. He couldn't wait to come back and rock the waves again!
