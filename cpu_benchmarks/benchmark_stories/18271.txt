Once upon a time, there was a small blue bird who loved to sing. Every day, the bird would fly to the top of a tree and sing a beautiful song. But one day, the bird started to worry. The sky was turning dark and it looked like a storm was coming. 
The small blue bird knew that it needed to find a safe place to hide from the storm. So, it flew around looking for a place to stay. It found a small hole in a tree and decided to go inside. 
Just as the bird got comfortable, the storm hit. The wind was blowing hard and the rain was pouring down. But the small blue bird was safe and dry in its little hole. It was happy that it had found a safe place to stay. And when the storm was over, the bird flew back to its tree and sang a beautiful song once again.
