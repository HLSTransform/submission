Joey was eager to build his tent outside. He picked out his favorite one and started to make it. It was a lot of fun!
When he was nearly done, something incredible happened. All around Joey, everything had frozen. He could even see his breath in the air!
He was so surprised that he just stood there for a minute and admired the world around him. The leaves were frozen in the trees, and he could even see a bird that had stopped in mid-flight!
Joey decided to finish his tent so he could sleep outside and he worked very hard to set it up. Eventually, his tent was all ready and he lay down inside and watched the world around him while it was still frozen.
He had a wonderful time in his tent, and when the temperature rose again, Joey went back inside. But, he was sure that he'd freeze a moment again some day!
