Once there was a rhinoceros named Bean. Bean loved to stroll through the forest. But one day, the forest was empty. Not a single creature could be found. Bean was sad. He missed all of his friends.
He decided to find them. He set off with a brave heart. He meandered through the forest, looking and listening for his friends. After a while, he heard someone singing. It was his friend Daisy the deer! She was singing a beautiful tune.
Bean was so happy to see Daisy. He hugged Daisy and said he missed her. Daisy said she missed him, too! Then Bean asked if she knew where the rest of his friends were. Daisy smiled and said they were all waiting for him at the lake.
Bean waved goodbye to Daisy and ran as fast as he could to the lake. When he arrived, he was thrilled to see all of his friends there waiting for him. He had never been so happy before! They all laughed and played together until the sun went down.
