Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Bill. Bill was a regular boy with regular toys, but he had a very special secret. Every night when he went to bed, he had a special trick. Bill would close his eyes tight and he would strike his pillow three times.
Suddenly, a nightmare appeared in his bedroom. The nightmare was a giant and it was menacing towards Bill. Bill was scared, but he remembered his special trick. He closed his eyes tight and then he struck his pillow three times. 
The nightmare shrank back and disappeared from the room.
"Did you do that?" asked Bill's mom.
"Yes," Bill replied. "I did my special trick and the mean nightmare was scared away."
From then on, Bill used his special trick every night before bed. Bill was never scared of nightmares ever again.
