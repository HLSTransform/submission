Once upon a time, there was an ancient street. On this street, there lived a cat and a dog. The cat and dog were best friends. They liked to play together all day. The street was their favorite place to play.
One day, the cat found a twisty toy. The toy was very fun. The cat and dog took turns twisting it. They twisted it to the left and to the right. The twisty toy made them very happy.
As the sun went down, the cat and dog were tired. They sat on the ancient street, holding their twisty toy. They knew they would play with it again tomorrow. And so, the cat and dog went to sleep, dreaming of more fun days on their street.
