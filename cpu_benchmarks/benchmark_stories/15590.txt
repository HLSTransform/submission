Lila was a bird who loved to soar in the sky. She liked to feel the wind on her wings and see the clouds and the sun. She wanted to learn more about the world, so she decided to go to university.
University was a big place with many buildings and many birds. Lila met new friends who taught her different things. She learned about songs, colors, shapes, and numbers. She also learned about other animals and places.
One day, Lila and her friends went to the park to play. They saw a turtle who was very slow. He was walking on the grass, looking for food. Lila flew down and said hello.
"Hello, turtle. What is your name?" Lila asked.
"My name is Tim. I am a turtle. What are you?" Tim said.
"I am Lila. I am a bird. I go to university. Do you know what that is?" Lila said.
"No, I don't. What is university?" Tim said.
"University is a place where you learn new things. You can learn about songs, colors, shapes, and numbers. You can also learn about other animals and places. Do you want to come with me and see?" Lila said.
Tim thought for a moment. He liked to learn new things, but he was very slow. He was afraid he would not be able to keep up with Lila and her friends.
"I don't know, Lila. I am very slow. How can I go with you?" Tim said.
Lila smiled. She had an idea.
"Don't worry, Tim. You can ride on my back. I will fly you to university. You can see the world from the sky. It is very fun. Come on, let's go!" Lila said.
Tim agreed. He climbed on Lila's back and held on tight. Lila flapped her wings and soared in the sky. Tim was amazed. He saw the trees, the flowers, the river, and the city. He saw other birds, squirrels, dogs, and cats. He saw the university and the park. He felt the wind and the sun. He was very happy.
Lila and Tim became good friends. They went to university together and learned new things. They also played and had fun. They learned that even if they were different, they could still share and help each other. They soared in the sky and in their minds.
