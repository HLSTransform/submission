Once upon a time there was a big girl. She had a new brain. She loved to admire the things around her.
One day, when she was walking in the park, she saw a big tree. She admired its tall branches, green leaves and spotted bark.
Then when she looked up, she saw a big, beautiful rainbow in the sky. She admired its colours and the way it shimmered in the sun.
She continued to admire the things around her. She admired the flowers, the butterflies and the birds in the sky.
At the end of the day, were so many beautiful things she admired. She was so pleased with her new brain. She thanked it for helping her admire all the wonderful things she had seen.
