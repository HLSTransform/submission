Once upon a time there was a little boy. His name was Joe and he was three years old. Joe was playing outside one day when he saw an expensive rope lying on the ground. Joe picked it up and carried it inside.
He asked his mom, “Mommy, can I use this to play, please?” 
His mom said “No, Joe. That’s an expensive rope. We are going to cook with it.”
Joe was disappointed, but he said, “Okay. What are you going to cook?”
His Mom smiled, “We are going to make a delicious cake with the expensive rope. Would you like to help me?”
Joe's eyes sparkled, “Yes! I'd love to help you cook.” 
So Joe and his mom cooked the delicious cake together. They laughed and had so much fun. When the cake was cooked, Joe said, “That was so yummy. I'm glad we used the expensive rope!”
