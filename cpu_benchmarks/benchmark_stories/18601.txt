Once upon a time, there was a funny car. It was blue and had big wheels. The car liked to drive fast and make people laugh. One day, the car was driving down the road when it hit a bump and got stuck. The wheels wouldn't move anymore!
The car felt sad and didn't know what to do. But then, a kind person came along and helped the car reverse out of the bump. The car was so happy and grateful! It drove away, feeling silly and funny once again. The end.
