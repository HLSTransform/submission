Bob was an obedient little boy. He was walking in the park one day when he saw a big gum tree. He wanted some of the gum, so he started to run towards the tree. He sped up as fast as he could and was soon standing beneath the big tree. Bob was so excited and happy, he couldn't believe how much gum was falling from the tree! He filled his pockets with gum, and then ran back to his house. All the way home, he was so pleased with all his gum and was glad he was so obedient. Bob enjoyed his gum for days afterwards.
