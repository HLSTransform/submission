Molly wanted a prize. She saw something gray on the table and ran to it. It was a box, but she didn't know what was inside. She picked it up and shook it. It made a noise and she wanted to know what was inside, but she couldn't open it. She asked her mum and she said it was a surprise. Molly wanted to see what it was, but she had to wait. 
Molly waited expectantly. Soon, her mum opened the box and inside was a beautiful pink and purple doll. She was so excited, she hugged it tightly and thanked her mum. 
Molly realised that the gray box had been a prize all along. She was delighted and played with her doll all day long, wanting her prize even more.
