Johnny was a child who was very frustrated. He had so many worries that he was not sure what to do. One day he was playing in the park when he saw his mum. 
Johnny ran to his mum and asked, "Mummy, what can I do with all my worries?"
His mum smiled and said, "Sometimes worries can be big, but we have to find ways to face them. Why don't you try counting to ten before you worry?"
Johnny thought about this for a moment and decided to give it a try. He breathed in and out slowly and counted to ten. Sure enough, his worries began to disappear. 
Johnny smiled and said, "Thanks, mum! From now on, I'll count to ten before I feel frustrated!"
