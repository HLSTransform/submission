Ben and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to run, slide and swing. They saw a big tree with many colors. It had green, yellow, red and brown leaves. They ran to the tree and looked at it.
"Wow, this tree is so pretty!" Mia said. "I like the colors. They are different from the other trees."
"Yes, they are," Ben said. "The tree is changing. It is getting ready for winter. Soon, the leaves will fall and the tree will have no colors."
"Will the tree be sad?" Mia asked.
"No, the tree will not be sad," Ben said. "The tree will rest and wait for spring. Then, it will grow new leaves and flowers. The tree is strong and brave."
Ben and Mia admired the tree. They wanted to be like the tree. They picked some leaves and made a strip of them. They put the strip around their heads like a crown.
"Look, we are the king and the queen of the park!" Ben said.
"We are!" Mia said. "And we are different and beautiful, like the tree!"
They laughed and played with their crowns. They felt happy and proud. They loved the tree and each other.
