Grandma and Eddie went to the store. Eddie was so excited. He wanted to hurry. Grandma said, "Let's go!" They ran to the store together.
When they got to the store, Eddie was so happy. He saw tall shelves full of fun things. He saw colorful toys, playful games, and yummy snacks. Grandma said, "Let's find something special for you."
Eddie couldn't decide. He wanted everything! He went up and down the aisles looking for the perfect toy. He pointed and laughed with joy. Finally, he chose a new stuffed animal - a playful puppy.
Grandma and Eddie hurried to pay. As they headed home, Eddie hugged his new playful puppy tightly. Grandma smiled at her happy grandson.
