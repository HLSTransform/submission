Once upon a time, there was a jolly boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his blocks. He would stack them up high and knock them down with a big smile on his face. 
One day, Timmy's mom poured him a glass of milk. Timmy watched as the white liquid poured into the glass. He was amazed by how it looked. 
After finishing his milk, Timmy went back to playing with his blocks. He built a tall tower and was so proud of himself. But then, he accidentally knocked it over. Timmy felt sad, but his mom reminded him that he could always build it again. 
And so, Timmy started stacking his blocks again, feeling jolly once more. He knew that even if he knocked them down again, he could always pour them out and start over.
