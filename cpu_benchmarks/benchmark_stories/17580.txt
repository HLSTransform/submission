Jill and Tom like to play in the bathroom. They like to spin the faucet and make water come out. Sometimes they make bubbles with soap and splash each other. They have fun and laugh a lot.
One day, they spin the faucet too hard. The faucet becomes tight and does not move. The water does not stop. It fills the sink and spills on the floor. Jill and Tom are scared. They do not know what to do.
They hear Mom coming. They hide behind the curtain. Mom sees the water and the mess. She is angry. She turns off the water and grabs a towel. She looks for Jill and Tom.
"Where are you, Jill and Tom?" she asks. "What did you do to the faucet?"
Jill and Tom peek from behind the curtain. They see Mom's face. They feel sorry. They come out and say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were playing and we spun the faucet too hard. We did not mean to make a mess."
Mom sighs. She hugs Jill and Tom. She says, "I know you were playing, but you have to be careful. The faucet is not a toy. It can break and make a lot of trouble. Next time, ask me before you play in the bathroom, okay?"
Jill and Tom nod. They say, "Okay, Mom. We are sorry. We will help you clean up."
Mom smiles. She says, "Thank you, Jill and Tom. I love you. Now, let's get this water out of here."
