Once upon a time there was a helpless village. One day, a flame appeared in the sky. Everyone in the village peeked out of their windows and doors to look at the flame. 
The flame grew bigger and brighter as it drew closer to the ground. Suddenly, a large fire dragon appeared from around the corner! The villagers were so scared that they all started running away.
The dragon chased the helpless villagers up and down the streets. Some of them ran really fast and were able to escape, but others weren't so lucky. The fire dragon was too powerful and the villagers couldn't fight back.
The fire dragon finally grew tired of chasing the villagers and flew back into the sky. Everyone in the village was so relieved that they were all safe. They all returned to their homes and thanked their lucky stars that they were still alive.
