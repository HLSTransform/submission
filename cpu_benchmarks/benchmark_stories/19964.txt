Tom and Anna were playing in the forest. They liked to pretend they were explorers and find new things. They saw a big cave and wanted to look inside.
"Maybe there is treasure in there," Tom said.
"Or maybe there is a monster," Anna said.
They were both a little scared, but also curious. They held hands and walked into the cave. It was dark and cold. They heard a growl.
"Who is there?" a voice said.
Tom and Anna stopped and shivered. They saw two yellow eyes shining in the dark. They were afraid it was a wolf.
"Please don't hurt us," Tom said. "We are just playing."
The voice laughed. "I am not a wolf. I am a bear. And I am not going to hurt you. I am generous."
The bear came out of the shadows and revealed himself. He was big and brown and furry. He had a friendly smile.
"Hello, little explorers," he said. "What are you looking for?"
Tom and Anna relaxed a bit. They saw that the bear was not mean. He was kind.
"We were looking for treasure," Anna said.
"Well, you are in luck," the bear said. "I have some treasure to share with you. Follow me."
The bear led them deeper into the cave. He showed them a pile of shiny stones, colorful feathers, and sweet berries. He gave some to Tom and Anna.
"These are my treasures," he said. "But I have more than I need. You can have some too. You are my new friends."
Tom and Anna were happy. They thanked the bear and gave him a hug. They took some of the treasures and went back to the forest. They had a new friend and a new adventure. They learned that not all caves have wolves, and not all bears are bad. Some are generous and nice.
