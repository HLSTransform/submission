One day, a bee named Bob went out to find honey. The sky was dark and it looked like it would rain soon. But Bob was brave and wanted to find sweet honey for his family.
Bob met a big bear named Ben. Ben said, "I know where to find sweet honey, but you must help me first." Bob agreed and they both went to get the honey. As they got closer, the sky got darker and it started to rain.
Bob and Ben found the honey and it was very sweet. They were both very happy. But the rain got heavier and heavier. They tried to go back home, but the rain was too strong. They got lost and couldn't find their way back. The sweet honey was not worth the trouble they had in the rain.
