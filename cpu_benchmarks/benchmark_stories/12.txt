Once upon a time, in a big park, there was a fun slide. Kids loved to play on the slide all day. One day, a small boy named Tim came to the park to play. Tim was a generous boy who loved to share his toys with his friends.
As Tim played on the slide, he saw a wreck near the park. The wreck was made of wood and old things. Tim thought it would be fun to make something new from the wreck. So, he asked his friends to help him.
Together, Tim and his friends moved the wreck. They made a new slide from the wood. Now, the park had two slides for kids to play on. Tim and his friends were so happy. They played on the new slide all day long.
