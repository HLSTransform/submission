Every morning, Mommy would get up early and prepare breakfast for everyone. She cooked nice eggs and made toast.
But this morning was different. Mommy grabbed a special box from the cupboard and was very happy. Inside the box was a flute!
Mommy said it was a surprise and she was going to prepare a nice surprise with the flute. She began playing a song with the flute and it was so beautiful!
When Daddy and the kids woke up, they all smiled at how nice the music was. Mommy had prepared a special treat for them all. They loved it so much!
