One day, a girl called Molly went to school. School was a place to learn. Molly was excited to learn new things! Her teacher was called Miss Smith. Miss Smith was nice and she taught Molly lots of things.
At school, Molly learnt about colours and numbers. She learnt how to write her name. She even learnt to dance! Molly enjoyed doing lots of new things and she was very helpful in class.
At the end of the day, Molly went home. She showed her parents everything she had learnt. It had been an expensive lesson, but Miss Smith had taught Molly well! Molly had learnt so much that day.
