Tim and Sue are friends. They like to play on the farm. They see a big pile of wheat. Wheat is yellow and soft. They want to touch it.
"Let's play with the wheat!" Tim says.
"OK!" Sue says.
They run to the pile of wheat. They grab some wheat and throw it in the air. They laugh and have fun.
But the farmer sees them. He is angry. He does not like them to play with his wheat. He needs the wheat for his bread.
"Hey, you two! Stop that!" the farmer shouts. "You are making my wheat dirty!"
Tim and Sue are scared. They drop the wheat and run away.
"Sorry, mister!" Tim says.
"Sorry, mister!" Sue says.
They run back to their house. They are sad. They like the wheat, but they do not want to make the farmer mad.
The next day, the farmer comes to their house. He has a basket in his hand. He knocks on the door.
"Hello, Tim and Sue," he says. "I have something for you."
He gives them the basket. They open it. They see two loaves of bread. The bread is warm and smells good.
"This is for you," the farmer says. "I made it with my wheat. I was angry yesterday, but I am not angry today. I know you were just having fun. But please, do not play with my wheat again. It is very important to me."
Tim and Sue are happy. They receive the bread from the farmer. They say thank you.
"Thank you, mister!" Tim says.
"Thank you, mister!" Sue says.
They invite the farmer to eat with them. They share the bread and some jam. They are friends. They do not play with the wheat anymore. They play with the cows and the chickens. They have fun.
