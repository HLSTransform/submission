Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a kind man named Tom. Tom had a big truck. He used the truck to bring things to the village. One day, he had to bring oil. The village needed the oil to cook food and keep warm.
On the way, Tom met a little boy named Tim. Tim looked sad. Tom asked, "Why are you sad, Tim?" Tim said, "I lost my toy. Can you help me find it?" Tom smiled and said, "Yes, I can help you. Let's look for your toy together."
Tom and Tim looked and looked. They found the toy under a tree. Tim was very happy. Tom said, "Now, let's bring the oil to the village." Tim said, "I want to help. I can be useful too." So, Tom and Tim worked together to bring the oil to the village.
Everyone in the village was happy. The oil was very useful. They could cook food and keep warm. Tom and Tim became good friends. They had fun helping each other and bringing things to the village. And they lived happily ever after.
