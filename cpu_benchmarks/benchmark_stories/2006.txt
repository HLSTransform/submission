Once upon a time there were two friends named Bobby and Jimmy. Bobby was a very naughty boy and he liked to buy things. One day, Jimmy told Bobby that he shouldn't buy so many things because he was being naughty. 
Bobby didn't want to listen to Jimmy and he kept buying whatever he wanted. This made Jimmy really mad, so he decided to take away all of Bobby's money.
Bobby cried and said he was sorry to Jimmy, and promised to not buy any more things without his friend's permission. Jimmy was happy to hear this and they hugged and made up.
From then on, Bobby and Jimmy would always check with each other before buying anything. They were friends again, and they lived happily ever after!
