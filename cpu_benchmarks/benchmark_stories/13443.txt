Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved taking showers because she liked to play with the water. One day, while she was taking a shower, she heard a knock on the bathroom door.
"Who is it?" Lily asked.
"It's me, your silly brother," her brother replied.
Lily recognized her brother's voice and asked him to come in. He came in and they played together in the shower. They laughed and had so much fun. After they were done, Lily's brother said, "That was so much fun, let's do it again tomorrow!"
Lily agreed and they hugged each other before her brother left the bathroom. Lily felt happy because she had fun with her brother in the shower.
