Once there was a kind ant. He wanted to sell something. He thought and thought about what he could sell. He decided to sell flowers! The ant went to a beautiful meadow and picked the prettiest flowers he could find. 
He carefully carried them back home and set up his shop. He got the perfect spot and made a sign. It said "Flowers for Sale!" 
The kind ant was so excited. He started selling the flowers to everyone who passed by. He sold so many flowers! He was so happy that he almost forgot to go home. 
Eventually the ant sold all his flowers and made a lot of money. He was so proud of himself! Everyone was so impressed with the kind ant's hard work. He was the best flower seller around!
