Once upon a time there was a dad who decided to build a big tomato garden. He wanted to grow lots of lovely tomatoes for his family. He invited his 3 year old son to help him build the garden. 
The 3 year old boy was excited and ran outside with his dad. Together they worked hard digging the soil, planting the tomato plants and building a fence around the garden.
The dad said, "Now my lovely son, let's cover the fence with a net, so the birds won't eat our tomatoes!"
The 3 year old son smiled and asked, "Can I help?" 
The dad smiled and said, "Yes my son. Come help me build the net."
Together the dad and his son worked hard and soon they finished building the net. The 3 year old son smiled and asked, "When can we pick the tomatoes?"
The dad said, "When they are ripe and red, my son. Then we can pick them, cook them and enjoy a lovely meal!"
The 3 year old boy smiled with pride and said, "We have built a wonderful tomato garden!"
