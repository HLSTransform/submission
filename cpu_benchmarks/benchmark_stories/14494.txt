Once upon a time, there was a modest girl named Lucy. She was preparing for a very special day – a day to celebrate a delicious dinner!
The dinner was a special cauliflower dish that Lucy had never seen before. It was white, bumpy and smelled like something yummy!
Lucy was so excited that she couldn't wait to tell her family about it. She ran to find her mom and dad and shouted, “Look what I found - a special, bumpy cauliflower! We can all celebrate the dinner together!”
Her family was just as excited as she was. They all worked together to prepare the delicious dinner.
When the meal was ready, they all sat down to enjoy it. It was a joyful feast, shared by the little family with love. Everyone had a wonderful time celebrating the special dinner.
The end.
