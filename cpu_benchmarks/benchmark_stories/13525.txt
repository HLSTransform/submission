Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the garden. One day, her mom gave her a bean to plant. Lily was very happy to receive it.
Lily watered the bean every day and watched it grow taller and taller. But one day, a rabbit came and ate the bean. Lily was frustrated and sad.
She went to her mom and said, "Mom, the rabbit ate my bean. I am frustrated." Her mom said, "It's okay, Lily. Sometimes things don't go as planned. But we can always try again."
So Lily planted another bean and this time she put a fence around it to keep the rabbit away. The bean grew into a big plant and Lily was very proud. She learned that even if things don't go as planned, we can always try again and never give up.
