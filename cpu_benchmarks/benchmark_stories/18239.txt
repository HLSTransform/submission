One day, a hairy dog named Spot saw a bush. The bush was big and green. Spot wanted to play with the bush. He ran to it and started to jump on it.
"Stop!" said a little bird. "You will destroy my home!" The bird lived in the bush. Spot did not listen. He kept jumping on the bush. The bird was very sad.
Spot destroyed the bush. The bird had no home. The bird flew away to find a new home. Spot was sad too. He did not have a friend to play with anymore.
