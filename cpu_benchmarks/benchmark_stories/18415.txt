Once upon a time, there was a big stone. It sat in a field all alone. One day, a little boy came along and started to kick the stone. The stone didn't like that and wanted the boy to stop. 
The stone said, "Stop kicking me, please!" But the boy didn't listen and kept kicking. The stone was getting very upset. 
Finally, the stone had enough and rolled away. The boy was surprised and didn't know where the big stone went. He learned his lesson and promised to never kick stones again.
