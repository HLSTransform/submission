Lily and Tom were best friends. They liked to play outside in the sun. One day, they went to the stream near their house. The stream was clear and cool. They saw some fish and frogs in the water.
"Look, Lily, a big frog!" Tom said. He pointed to a green frog on a rock. "Let's catch it and make it our pet!"
Lily nodded. She liked frogs. They were funny and slimy. She and Tom crept closer to the frog. They tried to be very quiet. But the frog saw them and jumped into the stream.
"Ribbit, ribbit!" the frog said. It sounded like it was laughing at them.
"Hey, frog, that's not nice!" Lily said. She was a little sad. She wanted to pet the frog.
Tom smiled. He had an idea. He picked up a stick and pretended it was a fishing rod. He dangled it over the water.
"Come on, frog, I have a tasty worm for you!" he said. He made a funny voice. He hoped the frog would come back.
Lily saw what Tom was doing. She giggled. She knew Tom was joking. She picked up another stick and joined him.
"Me too, me too!" she said. She also made a funny voice. "Frog, frog, we have yummy bugs for you!"
The frog heard them and peeked out of the water. It saw their sticks and their faces. It realized they were joking too. It decided to play along. It jumped out of the water and landed on Tom's stick.
"Gotcha!" Tom said. He lifted the stick and the frog. He was very happy.
Lily clapped her hands. She was happy too. She reached out to touch the frog.
"Hello, frog, you are our friend now!" she said.
The frog smiled. It liked Lily and Tom. They were fun and kind. They were not ordinary children. They were special. It croaked happily.
"Ribbit, ribbit!" it said. It meant "thank you" and "let's play some more".
