Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to fly. She would flap her arms and pretend to be a bird. One day, she saw a real fly and tried to catch it. But she accidentally knocked over a vase and broke it. She felt embarrassed and scared that her parents would be angry.
The little girl tried to make things peaceful by cleaning up the mess. But she cut her finger on a piece of glass and started crying. Her parents came in and saw what happened. They were upset and scolded her for not being careful.
The little girl felt sad and ashamed. She didn't want to fly anymore. She learned that accidents can happen and sometimes things don't end well.
