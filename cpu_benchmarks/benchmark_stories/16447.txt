Jill had a new coat. It was red and warm and had a zip. She liked to zip it up and down and hear the sound. She felt cozy in her coat. It was made of wool, like her teddy bear.
One day, she went to the park with her mom and dad. They played on the swings and the slide and the seesaw. Jill had fun. She saw a big dog. It was brown and fluffy and had a collar. She wanted to pet it. She ran to the dog and said hello.
But the dog did not like Jill. It barked and growled and showed its teeth. It jumped on Jill and bit her coat. Jill was scared and cried. Her mom and dad came and shooed the dog away. They hugged Jill and checked if she was hurt.
Jill was not hurt, but her coat was. The dog had ripped the wool and the zip. Her coat was not beautiful anymore. It was torn and dirty and had a hole. Jill was sad. She loved her coat.
Her mom and dad said they were sorry. They said they would get her a new coat. They said they would find one that was red and warm and had a zip. They said they would find one that was made of wool, like her teddy bear. They said they would find one that was beautiful, like Jill. Jill smiled. She knew they would. She hugged them and said thank you. She still liked her coat, but she was excited for a new one.
