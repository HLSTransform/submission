Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to skip. She would skip around town every day. She loved it so much that she even found a special rock to serve as her anchor while she skipped.
One day, while the little girl was skipping, the sky suddenly turned grey. Before she knew it, it was pouring rain and she was getting very wet and miserable. She had to find a place to stay dry, so she ran to a nearby shop. 
The shop keeper was so nice - he invited her to stay in the shop for as long as she wanted. But the little girl wanted to go back to skipping with her anchor. So, the shop keeper gave her an umbrella and some rain boots so she could stay dry while she skipped.
The little girl was so happy. She said goodbye to the shop keeper, skipped outside and started skipping merrily in the rain with her bright-coloured umbrella and her anchor rock in her pocket.
