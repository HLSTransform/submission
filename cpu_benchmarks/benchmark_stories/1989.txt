Once upon a time there were two friends, a bear and a duck. They were always together and had many adventures. 
One day they were walking through the woods when they spotted something yellow and shiny. It was a luxury! They both wanted to take it, so they started to quarrel. 
The arguing got louder and louder until an old owl flew down and said, “Friends don’t quarrel over things. You should share it and not fight.” 
The bear and duck thanked the wise old owl. They decided to work together and share the luxury. They enjoyed it and learnt the valuable lesson about sharing that day.
