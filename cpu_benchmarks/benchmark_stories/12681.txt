Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a toy rocket that he loved to play with. One day, Timmy's rocket started to rot and it became very ugly. 
Timmy's mom saw the missile and said, "Timmy, that toy is very old and ugly. You should throw it away." 
But Timmy loved his rocket and didn't want to throw it away. So, he kept playing with it. One day, Timmy's rocket broke and he was very sad. 
Timmy's mom said, "I told you that missile was old and ugly. Now it's broken and you can't play with it anymore." Timmy was very upset and cried. The end.
