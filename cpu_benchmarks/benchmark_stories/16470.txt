Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play together, but sometimes they fight. One day, they are playing with their toy cars in the living room. Mom is in the kitchen, making dinner. Dad is in his office, having a meeting on the phone.
"Vroom, vroom, my car is faster than yours!" Ben says, pushing his red car on the floor.
"No, it's not, my car is faster and cooler!" Anna says, pushing her blue car.
They start to race their cars, making loud noises. Dad hears them and gets angry.
"Anna, Ben, be quiet! I'm having a very important meeting! Go to your room and play there!" Dad shouts from his office.
"But Dad, we want to play here!" Anna and Ben say.
"No, you have to go now! And don't slam the door!" Dad says.
Anna and Ben are sad and mad. They pick up their cars and go to their room. They slam the door hard, making a loud bang.
"Anna, Ben, I said don't slam the door!" Dad says.
"Sorry, Dad!" Anna and Ben say.
They sit on their bed, sulking. They don't want to play with their cars anymore. They are bored and sleepy.
"Anna, do you want to read a book?" Ben asks.
"No, I don't want to read a book. I want to play with my car." Anna says.
"Ben, do you want to draw a picture?" Anna asks.
"No, I don't want to draw a picture. I want to play with my car." Ben says.
They are quiet for a while. They look at each other and sigh.
"Anna, I'm sorry I said my car was faster and cooler than yours." Ben says.
"Ben, I'm sorry I said my car was faster and cooler than yours." Anna says.
They hug and smile.
"Anna, do you want to play with our cars again?" Ben asks.
"Yes, I do. But let's be quiet, so we don't make Dad angry." Anna says.
"OK, let's be quiet. And let's share our cars, so we can have more fun." Ben says.
They take their cars and play on the floor, whispering and giggling. They are happy and sleepy.
Mom comes to their room and sees them playing.
"Anna, Ben, it's time for dinner. Dad is done with his meeting. He wants to see you." Mom says.
"OK, Mom. We're coming." Anna and Ben say.
They put their cars away and go to the living room. Dad is waiting for them. He looks tired and sleepy.
"Anna, Ben, I'm sorry I yelled at you. I know you were just having fun. But I had a very important meeting and I needed to be quiet." Dad says.
"It's OK, Dad. We're sorry we slammed the door. We know you were working hard. But we were just playing with our cars." Anna and Ben say.
They hug and kiss Dad.
"I love you, Anna. I love you, Ben. You are my best cars." Dad says.
"I love you, Dad. You are our best driver." Anna and Ben say.
They sit down and have dinner together. They are happy and sleepy.
