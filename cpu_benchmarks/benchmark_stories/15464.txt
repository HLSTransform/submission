Once upon a time there was a lucky kitten living on a farm. He loved to play in the warm sunlight and chase butterflies. One day, the kitten decided to explore the big white house by the barn.
He slowly crept up the stairs and peeked into the first room. There in the corner was the biggest fireplace he had ever seen. He had never seen anything like it before. The kitten was excited, so he ran inside to explore.
Suddenly, the kitten heard a loud noise. He quickly spun around and went back down the stairs. He was frightened, but he was also very curious. He decided to go back up with more caution.
When he reached the top of the steps, the kitten noticed a dark object next to the fireplace. He slowly stepped closer and felt its cold metal surface. It was a shiny handle, and it was connected to something strange. The kitten gave it a tug and the handle started to move. The kitten had just reversed the fireplace!
The room filled with warm air and a soft orange glow. The kitten was so happy and excited that he started jumping around. He had been so lucky to find the fireplace and reverse it! He ran downstairs and told all his animal friends the amazing story.
