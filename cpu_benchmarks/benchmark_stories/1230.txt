Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and wear her favorite cap. One day, it started to rain and Lily's cap got wet. She was sad because she couldn't wear it anymore. 
But then, she had an idea! She decided to perform a magic trick to make her cap dry again. She waved her hands and said some magic words. To her surprise, her cap became dry! 
Lily was so happy that she could wear her cap again. She went outside to play and showed her friends her magic trick. They were amazed and asked her to perform it again. Lily felt proud of herself and had a fun day playing with her friends.
