Once upon a time, there lived four friends. Jack, Kate, Paul, and Emma were always together. Every day, they would go on long walks and play games.
Wherever they went, Jack was the most reliable. He always spoke in a kind and gentle way. His friends trusted him for he was never wrong.
One morning, the four friends were walking by a big river when Jack stopped. He had something to say!
He told them, "I have a surprise for you! Don't worry, it's something really good."
The friends were so excited they began jumping around. What could the surprise be?
Jack bent down and when he rose, he was holding four bags. In each bag, there was a special treat!
Jack had found some delicious treats at the market and got one for each of his friends. He had been so reliable they hadn't even known he was gone.
The friends were so happy and they thanked Jack again and again. Jack grinned from ear to ear and said, "It's my pleasure!"
