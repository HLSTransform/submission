One day, John saw a grumpy clown. John was excited to see a clown and he asked the clown to do a trick. 
The clown frowned and said, "No tricks today. I'm too grumpy." 
John was sad. He asked the clown what was wrong, but the clown wouldn't answer. 
John noticed the clown had lots of tears in his eyes and he said, "Do you want to be happy again?" 
The clown scratched his head and sighed. He said, "Yes, I do. I'm so grumpy because I miss my friends." 
John smiled and said, "Let me help you! I can be your friend!" 
The clown smiled back and said, "Really? That would be great!" 
John and the clown became friends. They laughed and played together and the clown was no longer grumpy.
