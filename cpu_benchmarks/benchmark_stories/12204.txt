Once upon a time there was a pink bird. It could say lots of things. One day the bird saw an image in the sky. It said, "What is this?" The bird was very curious. It flew up high and closer to the image. The image was of a big red balloon. The bird said “That’s fun!” The bird flew down and told its friends about the image. All the birds were very excited. They said, “Let’s fly up and see the image for ourselves.” So the birds all flew up together. When they saw the balloon, they said, “Wow, it’s pink!” They were so happy they started to sing and dance. The birds stayed up in the sky to enjoy the pink balloon. They had a wonderful time together.
