Lily liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She made pictures of flowers, animals and people. She was happy when she painted.
One day, she had a new friend, Ben. Ben also liked to paint. He had a big box of paints. He wanted to show Lily his pictures. He said, "Look at my paintings. They are very good. I can paint better than you."
Lily felt sad. She did not like Ben's words. She said, "Your paintings are nice, but mine are nice too. We can paint different things. We can learn from each other."
But Ben was bossy. He said, "No, you have to paint like me. You have to use my colors and my brushes. You have to copy my pictures. Then you can be a good painter."
Lily did not want to do that. She liked her own colors and brushes. She liked her own pictures. She said, "No, thank you. I want to paint my way. You can paint your way. We can be different and still be friends."
But Ben did not listen. He took Lily's paints and brushes. He said, "You have to do what I say. I am the best painter. You have to follow me."
Lily was angry. She wanted her paints and brushes back. She said, "Give me my things. You are not the best painter. You are a bad friend. You are not nice."
Ben laughed. He said, "I was just joking. I wanted to see how you would react. I don't really care about your paintings. I just wanted to have fun."
Lily did not think it was a joke. She thought it was a mean thing to do. She said, "That is not a joke. That is a hurtful thing to do. You made me feel bad. You did not respect me. You did not have fun. You were rude."
Ben felt sorry. He realized he was wrong. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I should not have been bossy. I should not have taken your things. I should not have laughed at you. I should have been kind. I should have been a good friend."
Lily forgave Ben. She said, "It's okay, Ben. I forgive you. But please don't do that again. Please be nice. Please be a good friend."
Ben nodded. He said, "I will, Lily. I will be nice. I will be a good friend. Can we paint together?"
Lily smiled. She said, "Yes, we can paint together. We can share our colors and brushes. We can make our own pictures. We can learn from each other. We can have fun."
They painted together. They made beautiful pictures. They were happy. They were good friends.
The moral of the story is: Don't be bossy. Be kind. Respect others. Be a good friend.
