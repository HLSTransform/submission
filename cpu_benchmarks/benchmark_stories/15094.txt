Once upon a time there was a neat little duckling. She was so small and fluffy, a lovely pink colour. Each day she would look for food, quacking to all her feathered friends.
One day the duckling spotted something new in the pond. It was a funny looking machine with lots of buttons and gadgets! She clicked a button and out popped a loaf of bread. 
The duckling was delighted and started to munch away. Just then a friendly voice called out from the machine, "Good morning duckling! I love to provide yummy food for my feathered friends!" 
The little duckling knew she was in luck! From then on the machine would provide her with plenty of yummy food to eat each day. She was so happy and quacked with delight! 
The little duckling soon learnt that the machine was operated by a very kind lady. The duckling felt so thankful and visited the lady every day, knowing that she would always be provided with lovely food to eat.
