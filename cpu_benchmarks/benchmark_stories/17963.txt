Once upon a time, there was a furry dog named Max. Max loved to play and run in the park. One day, while Max was playing, he saw another dog. This dog was big and strong. Max could tell that this dog liked to fight.
Max did not want to fight, so he came up with a plan. He found a big, juicy bone and decided to give it to the big dog. Max hoped that the big dog would like the bone and not want to fight anymore.
Max walked up to the big dog and yielded the bone to him. The big dog sniffed the bone and wagged his tail. He took the bone and started to chew on it. Max's plan worked! The big dog did not want to fight anymore, and they both played happily together in the park.
