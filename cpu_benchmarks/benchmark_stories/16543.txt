Anna liked to shine her flashlight in her bedroom at night. She had many attractive stickers on her flashlight. She liked to make shapes and colors on the wall with the light. She felt happy and safe in her bedroom.
But one night, her brother Tom came into her bedroom. He was angry and mean. He said, "Stop shining your flashlight! You are making too much noise and light. I can't sleep in my bedroom. Give me your flashlight now!" He tried to grab her flashlight from her hand.
Anna did not want to give her flashlight to Tom. She said, "No, this is my flashlight! You can't have it. Go away and leave me alone!" She held her flashlight tight and shone it in Tom's face. He squinted and shouted, "Ow, that hurts! Stop it, stop it!"
They started to fight over the flashlight. They pulled and pushed and yelled. They made a lot of noise and mess in the bedroom. They woke up their mom and dad, who came to see what was wrong.
Mom and dad were not happy. They said, "What are you doing? Why are you fighting over a flashlight? This is not how you behave at night. You should be quiet and respectful and go to sleep. Now, give us the flashlight and say sorry to each other."
Anna and Tom felt ashamed and sorry. They gave the flashlight to mom and dad and said sorry to each other. They hugged and said good night. Mom and dad tucked them in their beds and kissed them. They turned off the light and left the bedroom.
Anna and Tom closed their eyes and tried to sleep. They did not shine the flashlight anymore. They dreamed of attractive stickers and shapes and colors. They felt happy and safe in their bedroom.
