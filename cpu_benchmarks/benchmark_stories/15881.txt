John and his mom were walking to the park. John saw many colorful things along the way. He saw a playground and a pond with ducks. He was so excited.
Suddenly, John noticed something very attractive on the ground. It was a piece of chalk. He immediately asked his mom for it.
"Can I have the chalk, Mommy? Please?" asked John eagerly.
His mom smiled and said, "Yes, of course you can have it! The chalk is for you."
John was so happy. He took the chalk and started drawing on the sidewalk. He made a beautiful rainbow and some funny animals. He liked the way it looked and wanted to show it off. He dragged his mom over to see the chalk art he had made.
"Look, Mommy!" said John proudly. "I made this!" 
His mom looked fondly at him and said, "It's so creative, John! You did a great job!"
John smiled with joy and hugged his mom. He was so pleased with how attractive his chalk drawing looked.
