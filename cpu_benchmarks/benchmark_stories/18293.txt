Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny was very cute and everyone thought he was adorable. One day, Benny wanted to go to the other side of the hall to get some carrots. But the hall was very long and Benny struggled to get to the other side.
As Benny was struggling, he saw a little bird that had fallen from its nest. The bird was in trouble and needed help. Benny knew he had to help the bird, even though it was hard for him to move in the hall. Benny hopped over to the bird and helped it back into the nest.
Benny learned that even though things can be hard and you might struggle, it's important to help others in need. And that's what makes you a good friend. From that day on, Benny always looked out for his friends and helped them whenever they needed it.
