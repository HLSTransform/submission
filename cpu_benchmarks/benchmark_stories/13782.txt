Sara and Ben were twins who liked to play in the garden. They had a big box of toys that they shared, but sometimes they fought over them. One day, they found a shiny red car in the box that they both wanted.
"Give me the car, it's mine!" Sara said.
"No, it's mine, I saw it first!" Ben said.
They pulled and tugged at the car, but neither of them would let go. They started to yell and cry, and made a lot of noise.
"Stop it, you two!" their mom said, coming out of the house. "You are spoiling your fun and making a mess. Why can't you share the car and play nicely?"
"But mom, we both want the car!" Sara and Ben said.
Mom looked at the car and saw something that made her frown. She took the car from their hands and showed them the bottom. There was a hole in the car, and a worm was crawling out of it.
"Look, this car is broken and has a worm in it. It's not a good toy to play with. You should throw it away and find something else." mom said.
Sara and Ben felt ashamed and sorry. They realized that they had wasted their time and energy fighting over a bad toy, and that they had hurt each other's feelings. They hugged and said sorry to each other, and to mom.
"Mom, we're sorry. We were silly and selfish. We don't want the car anymore. Can we play with something else?" Sara and Ben said.
Mom smiled and hugged them back. She was glad that they learned their lesson and made up. She gave them a ball and a kite, and told them to have fun in the garden.
"Here you go, Sara and Ben. These are good toys to play with. You can take turns and help each other. Remember, sharing is caring, and fighting is spoiling. Now go and have fun, and don't be restless." mom said.
Sara and Ben thanked mom and ran to the garden. They played with the ball and the kite, and had a lot of fun. They shared and helped each other, and didn't fight anymore. They were happy and peaceful, and mom was proud of them.
