Once upon a time there were two special people who really loved each other. One day they decided to get married. It was an important day for both of them.
They were calling it the Big Day. On Big Day, they both put on new clothes. After that, they went to the special place where lots of their family and friends were.
One of the family members said to them “Are you ready?” They both nodded their heads and smiled. Then everyone started pulling, first the bride and then the groom. Everyone was very happy and laughing. 
Big Day was a lot of fun and it was an important moment for them. Now they are married and living happily ever after.
