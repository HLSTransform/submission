Miles was playing in the park one day when he suddenly lost his favourite toy. He started looking everywhere, but he couldn't find it.
Just then, a kind lady appeared. She smiled at Miles and said, "What's wrong, little one?"
Miles replied, "I lost my toy. I can't find it!"
The lady smiled and said, "Don't worry. I'll help you look for it. What does it look like?"
Miles described his toy to the lady, and they started searching in the grass together. Miles looked hard and he saw something shining!
"Look!" he said.
Miles picked up the toy and hugged it tightly. The lady smiled and said, "I'm glad you found your toy. You should be more serious from now on, so you don't lose it again!"
Miles nodded and said, "Yes, I will!"
The kind lady had been a great pupil, and Miles thanked her for helping him find his toy again.
