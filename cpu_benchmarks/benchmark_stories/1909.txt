Once upon a time, there lived a small mouse. The mouse was very happy in her home, until one day a wizard decided to cast a spell. The spell made the mouse very mad, so she decided to strike back. She ran around the wizard’s house, trying to find a way to stop the spell.
After a lot of looking, the mouse finally found a small book in the wizard's kitchen. It was a special book that could break any spell. She ran back out of the house, grabbed the book, and hurried to the wizard. The mouse bravely offered the book to the wizard and asked him to break the spell. 
The wizard was pleased with the mouse’s bravery, and used the book to break the spell. The mouse was so happy that she hugged the wizard, thanked him for breaking the spell, and ran back to her home. The mouse was relieved that her home was safe and sound again, and that no spells would strike her!
