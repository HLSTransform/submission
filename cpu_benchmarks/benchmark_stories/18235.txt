Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a clever cat named Tom. Tom was a happy cat who loved to play with his ball. One day, Tom saw a symbol on the wall. It was a big star.
Tom wanted to touch the star, but it was too high. He tried to jump, but he could not reach it. The wind blew and made Tom shiver. He felt cold, so he put on his warm hat.
Tom had an idea. He found a big box and put it under the star. He climbed on the box and finally touched the star. Tom was so happy and proud of his clever idea. He then went inside to play with his ball, feeling warm and cozy.
