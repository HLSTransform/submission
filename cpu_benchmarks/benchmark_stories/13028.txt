Once upon a time there was a chubby couch in a warm and cozy room. One day, an old lady and a grandma came to visit. When they sat down on the couch, it started to creak and wobble. 
The old lady was so angry she decided to slap the chubby couch. She slapped it hard, but the couch just kept wobbling. The grandma laughed and said, “Grandma, why don’t you give the couch a cuddle instead of a slap?” 
So the old lady cuddled the couch and sure enough, it stopped wobbling. The old lady and the grandma were so happy that the chubby couch was nice and still again. And they all lived happily ever after.
