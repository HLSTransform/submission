Once there was a family that loved to go on picnics in the park. Each day they brought a different plant on their blanket and together they arranged it different ways.
One day when packing the picnic, the dad said to the 3 year old: "Let's take the smelly plant today!"
The 3 year old was surprised and asked "Will it smell?"
The mom put her hand on the 3 year old's shoulder and said "It's okay, just wait and see".
On the way to the park, the 3 year old asked repeatedly "What is the smelly plant?"
At the park, the 3 year old saw many different plants laid out on the blanket. Then the mom said: "In the middle of all these plants is the one that smells!"
The family went ahead and laid out the picnic and included the smelly plant in the centre. When the 3 year old tried it, it was stinky! They all had a good laugh about it.
