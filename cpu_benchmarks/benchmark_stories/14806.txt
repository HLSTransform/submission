Tom and Anna were playing in the garden. They had a big jug of water and some cups. They pretended to have a tea party with their toys.
"Would you like some tea, Mr. Bear?" Anna asked, pouring water into a cup.
"Yes, please, Anna. You are very kind," Tom said, making his bear talk.
They smiled and drank their water. They liked to play together.
But then, a big, ugly dog came into the garden. It had black fur and sharp teeth. It barked loudly and ran towards them.
Tom and Anna were scared. They dropped their cups and jug. The water spilled on the ground.
"Go away, dog! Leave us alone!" Tom shouted, holding his bear.
The dog did not listen. It jumped on their toys and tore them apart. It bit the bear's ear and the doll's dress.
Tom and Anna cried. They ran to the house and called for their mom.
Mom came out and saw the dog. She was angry. She picked up a stick and waved it at the dog.
"Shoo, shoo, bad dog! Get out of here!" she yelled.
The dog was afraid of mom. It whimpered and ran away.
Mom hugged Tom and Anna. She checked their toys. Some were broken, some were not.
"I'm sorry, my loves. That was a mean dog. It should not have come here," she said.
"It's okay, mom. We still have some toys. And we have you," Anna said.
Tom nodded. He smiled and gave his bear a kiss.
Mom smiled too. She took them inside and gave them some cookies.
They forgot about the ugly dog. They were happy again.
