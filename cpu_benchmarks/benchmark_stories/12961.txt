Mia and her family were driving down a long road. Mia was so excited that she couldn't keep still. Suddenly, they arrived at a special place- Mia's Grandma's house. They all ran in and found the trunk in the corner of the room.
Mia was so excited. “What’s in the trunk Grandma?”
Grandma smiled. “It’s something special. I’m going to help you decorate it!”
Mia was helpless and didn’t know what to do. Grandma took out some paint, brushes and glitter. She said, “Let’s paint the trunk and make it look extra special!”
Mia and Grandma worked together, using all the decorations to make the trunk look extra special. After a few hours, they stepped back and admired their work. The trunk was so pretty and bright with colours.
Mia smiled. “Thanks Grandma, I love our special trunk!”
