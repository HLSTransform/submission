Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a bright yellow dress that she loved to wear. One day, Lily's mom gave her a bag to carry her toys in. Lily was so happy and asked her mom if she could take it with her everywhere she went. 
Lily went to the park with her bag and played with her toys. She had a doll, a ball, and a teddy bear. When it was time to go home, Lily put her toys in the bag and asked her mom if she could carry it. Her mom said yes and Lily felt so proud. 
From that day on, Lily took her bag with her wherever she went. She loved how it made her feel like a big girl. And whenever she wanted to play with her toys, she would just ask her mom for the bag and she was ready to go!
