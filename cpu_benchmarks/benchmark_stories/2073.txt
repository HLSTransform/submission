Once upon a time, there was a big, fat bear named Coal. Coal loved to eat honey and berries, but one day he ate too much and felt very full. He sighed and decided to take a nap. While he was sleeping, some mischievous squirrels snuck into his cave and stole his honey. When Coal woke up, he was sad and hungry. He looked everywhere for his honey but couldn't find it. Finally, he asked a friendly rabbit for help. The rabbit showed Coal where the squirrels had hidden the honey and Coal was very happy again. From then on, Coal learned to only eat a little bit of honey at a time so he wouldn't feel so full and sleepy.
