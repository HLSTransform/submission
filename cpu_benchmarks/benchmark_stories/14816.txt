Sara and Tom are playing in the park. They see a big brown rope hanging from a tree. Sara wants to use the rope to swing like a monkey. Tom wants to use the rope to make a trap for bugs.
"Let me use the rope first!" Sara says.
"No, I want to use the rope first!" Tom says.
They both pull the rope hard. The rope breaks and falls to the ground. Sara and Tom are sad and angry.
"Look what you did!" Sara says.
"It's your fault!" Tom says.
They start to cry and yell at each other.
A nice lady sees them and comes over. She has a big smile and a basket of cookies.
"Hello, children. Why are you crying?" she asks.
"We broke the rope and we can't play with it anymore!" Sara says.
"We wanted to use the rope for different things and we fought over it!" Tom says.
The nice lady nods and says, "I see. That's not very nice of you. You should share and take turns. The rope is not yours, it belongs to the park. You should be careful and respectful of the things you find here. Maybe you can find another way to play together."
She gives them each a cookie and says, "Here, have a cookie. It will make you feel better. And maybe you can say sorry to each other and be friends again."
Sara and Tom look at each other and feel sorry. They say sorry and hug each other. They thank the nice lady and eat their cookies. They decide to play with the leaves and the sticks instead of the rope. They have fun and laugh together. They learn to share and take turns. They are happy.
