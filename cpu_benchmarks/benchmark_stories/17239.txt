Once upon a time, there was a driver named Tim. Tim drove a big red car that was very beautiful. He loved to drive his car around the town and show it off to his friends.
One day, Tim decided to mix some ingredients to make a cake. He got some flour, sugar, eggs, and milk, and he put them all in a bowl. Then, he mixed them all together with a big spoon. When he was done, he put the cake in the oven to bake.
While the cake was baking, Tim went outside to wash his beautiful car. He scrubbed it with soap and water until it was shiny and clean. When he was done, he went back inside and took the cake out of the oven. It smelled so good! He cut a big slice and ate it all up. It was the most delicious cake he had ever tasted.
