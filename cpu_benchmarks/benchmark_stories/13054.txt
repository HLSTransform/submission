Once upon a time there was a brave girl called Daisy. Daisy was very adventurous and always wanted to explore. 
One day, Daisy found a big wooden box with a lock on it. She wondered what was inside and wanted to open it up. But the lock was too hard to open, no matter how much she tried. 
Then Daisy had an idea. She remembered that her dad had given her an old key, so she grabbed it and put it into the lock. She turned the key and - click, the lock opened!
Inside the box was a map with an X marked on it. Daisy quickly grabbed the map and set off for the X. It was a long journey, but Daisy was brave and kept going.
When Daisy arrived at the X she found a magical doorway. She stepped inside and entered a wondrous, mysterious world. But it was a dangerous world and Daisy soon started to suffer.
Luckily, with all of her courage and strength, Daisy managed to find her way out and returned home safe and sound.
What an amazing and unforgettable adventure she had had!
