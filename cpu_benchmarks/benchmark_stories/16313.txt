Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a soft, red velvet dress that she loved to wear. One day, her mommy took her to the store to buy some toys. Lily saw a big, nosy dog outside the store, but she was not afraid. 
When they got inside, Lily saw lots of toys she wanted to buy. She had some money in her pocket that she wanted to spend. She picked out a doll and a teddy bear. Her mommy said she could only choose one, so she decided to spend her money on the teddy bear. 
Lily hugged her new teddy bear tightly and they walked outside. The nosy dog was still there, but Lily did not mind because she had her new friend with her. She went home happy and spent the rest of the day playing with her new teddy bear on her soft, red velvet dress. The end.
