Once upon a time, there was a small bunny named Romy. He lived in a big, green field at the edge of town. Every day he'd hop through the field, eating juicy carrot tops and buttercups.
One day, Romy decided to explore the town nearby. He hopped down the long, dusty road and stopped near a big, gnarly tree. There, hanging from the tree, was the most beautiful furball he had ever seen!
Romy crept closer to the furry creature and exclaimed, "Oh, hello! What are you?
The furball answered, "I'm a hedgehog! I'm hanging here to make a home among the tree's roots. What's your name?"
"I'm Romy," the bunny said.
The hedgehog said, "Thank you, Romy! It's nice to meet you!" 
Romy hopped on his way, amazed that he had seen such a hairy creature. He would never forget his adventure down the dusty road!
