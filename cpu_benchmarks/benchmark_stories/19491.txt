Once there was a little boy who was 3-years-old. He liked playing and singing, but he really hated vegetables. Every day, his mom gave him vegetables and asked him to eat them, but he always cried and said he didn’t want them. 
One day, his mom had an idea. She told the little boy, “If you eat some vegetables, I’ll give you a special treat.” So, the little boy tried to be calm and eat his vegetables. He ate half and then asked for his treat. His mom smiled and gave him a yummy cookie. 
He was so happy and ate the whole plate of vegetables! After that, he never hated vegetables, but he still didn’t like them very much.
