Once there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved playing in her room, but her bed was too small. She wanted a bigger bed, like the one in her mommy and daddy's room.
So she asked her mommy, "Can I use your bed?"
Her mommy smiled and said, "Sure, sweetheart. You can use my bed, but you also need to keep your little bed too."
So Lucy used both beds. She loved hopping around between the two and having some much room to move around.
Every night, she said to her mommy, "Goodnight, thank you for letting me use your big bed!"
And her mommy said, "You're very welcome. Sleep tight!"
