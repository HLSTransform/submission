Once upon a time, there was a man who had no hair on his head. He was bald. One day, he wanted to go to the store to buy some candy. But he had to delay his trip because he had a toothache. He was sad because he really wanted some candy. 
He decided to go to the dentist to fix his tooth. The dentist was very nice and fixed his tooth. The man was happy because he could finally go to the store to buy some candy. He put on his hat to cover his bald head and went to the store. He bought lots of candy and shared it with his friends. They all had a great time eating candy together. The end.
