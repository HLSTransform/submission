Lily loved to bake with her mom. They would stir the flour, the eggs, and the sugar in a big bowl. They would make circles with the dough and put them on a tray. They would smell the cookies in the oven and wait for them to be ready.
One day, Lily wanted to bake by herself. She did not ask her mom for help. She took the bowl, the eggs, and the sugar from the kitchen. She tried to stir them, but she made a mess. The eggs broke and the sugar spilled. She did not know how to make circles with the dough. She put the tray in the oven and turned it on.
But Lily forgot to set the timer. She went to play with her toys and did not watch the oven. The cookies burned and made a lot of smoke. The smoke alarm went off and scared Lily. Her mom came running and saw the disaster. She turned off the oven and opened the windows. She was angry and sad.
Lily felt miserable. She had ruined the cookies and the kitchen. She had made her mom unhappy. She wished she had listened to her mom and asked for help. She said sorry to her mom and hugged her. Her mom forgave her and hugged her back. She said, "Lily, baking is fun, but you need to be careful and follow the rules. Next time, let's bake together, okay?" Lily nodded and smiled. She learned her lesson. She loved to bake with her mom.
