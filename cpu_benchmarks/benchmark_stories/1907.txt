Once upon a time there was an alarm. Every morning it was very bright and loud. Every morning it said “come!”. So everyone came to wake up. Everyone got up and listened to the bright alarm. It said “come, come, come!”. So everyone came to get dressed and eat breakfast. Then it was time to go to school and play. After school everyone came back home to eat dinner. Then it was time for bed and the alarm said “come!” again. So everyone came to brush their teeth and take a bath. Then the alarm said “come to bed”, so everyone came to bed and fell asleep. The end.
