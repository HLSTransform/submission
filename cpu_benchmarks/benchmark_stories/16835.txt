Once upon a time, there was a mommy bird. She had a very noisy baby bird in her nest. The mommy bird wanted to go and find some food for her baby. She said to her baby bird, "I am going to carry you in my beak and fly to find some food."
The baby bird said, "Okay mommy, I trust you." So, the mommy bird carefully picked up her infant in her beak and flew away. They flew over the trees and the flowers. The baby bird was so happy to be carried by his mommy.
Suddenly, they saw a big, juicy worm on the ground. The mommy bird swooped down and grabbed it with her beak. She carried it back to the nest and fed it to her baby. The baby bird was very happy and said, "Thank you mommy for carrying me and finding me some yummy food." The end.
