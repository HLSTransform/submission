Once upon a time, there was a red bird named Bob. Bob loved to play in the rain and soak his feathers. One day, while playing, he found a shiny screw on the ground.
Bob wanted to show the screw to his friend, Cat. He flew to Cat's house and said, "Look what I found, Cat! A shiny screw!" Cat looked at the screw and said, "That's nice, Bob. But we should find who it belongs to."
Together, Bob and Cat went around and asked their friends if they lost a screw. Finally, they found Dog, who was sad because his toy was broken. "I lost a screw," Dog said. Bob and Cat gave the screw back to Dog, and he was very happy.
The moral of the story is that it is good to help others and return things that do not belong to us.
