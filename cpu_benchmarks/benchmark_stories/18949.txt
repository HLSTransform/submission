Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She had a pretty dress that she loved very much. One day, Mia had to go to a big party. She was very nervous because she did not know many people there.
At the party, Mia saw another girl wearing the same dress. She felt sad and did not dare to talk to the girl. Mia thought that the girl would be mad at her. She went to a corner and sat alone.
Then, the girl with the same dress came to Mia. She said, "Hi, I like your dress! Let's be friends." Mia was happy and not nervous anymore. They played together and had a lot of fun. From that day on, they became best friends.
