Once upon a time, there was a little car named Red. Red was very tired after driving all day, so he wanted to rest. He found a nice spot under a tree and parked there. 
Suddenly, he heard a voice saying, "Wow, Red, you have such a cool motor!" It was his friend Blue, who was envious of Red's motor. 
"Thanks, Blue," said Red. "But now I need to rest. I've been driving all day and I'm very tired." 
"Okay, Red," said Blue. "Rest well and I'll see you tomorrow!" And with that, Red closed his eyes and fell asleep, dreaming of all the adventures he would have with his motor.
