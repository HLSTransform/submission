Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and make funny sounds. One day, Timmy took his favorite toy car and accidentally broke it. He felt bad and wanted to fix it, but he didn't know how. 
Timmy's friend, Bobby, came over to play and saw the broken toy car. Bobby was angry and yelled at Timmy. Timmy felt sad and cried. But then, Bobby forgave Timmy and they played together again. 
Later that day, Timmy's mom called him for dinner. Timmy was excited because he loved his mom's cooking. But when he got to the kitchen, he saw that his little sister had eaten all the food. Timmy was upset and thought it wasn't fair. 
Timmy went to bed that night feeling sad and hungry. He wished for a better day tomorrow. But unfortunately, Timmy got sick and had to stay in bed for a long time. Timmy was very sad and missed playing with his friends. The end.
