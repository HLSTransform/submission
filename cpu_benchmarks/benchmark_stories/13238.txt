Once upon a time there was a foolish man. He wanted to go to university but he didn't know how. He had heard that if you could roll a ball a special way, you might get a ticket to university.
So, he rolled the ball and waited. Nothing happened. He rolled it again, and again and again, but still nothing happened. 
He kept trying, day after day. He rolled the ball round and round, backwards and forwards and upside down. Still nothing happened.
He was sad, so he stopped. As he stopped, he heard a quiet voice say "Well done". He was so surprised. He looked around but there was no one there. 
He looked down, and to his surprise, he saw the ball had opened up a magical door. He had done it! 
He stepped inside, and the door closed behind him. He had gone to university!
