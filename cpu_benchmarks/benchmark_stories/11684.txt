Melanie was walking down the street and saw a vendor selling toys. She really wanted to get one, but didn't have any money. She got really sad and a tear came down her face.
But then the vendor saw and came over. He asked her to pick one of the toys. She chose a blue teddy bear. She hugged it tight and the vendor gave her a big smile.
Melanie was so happy, she couldn't stop smiling. She said thank you and skipped away, still hugging her blue teddy bear.
