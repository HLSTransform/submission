Sara liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had long hair, a pink dress and a shiny necklace. Sara gave Lily a hug every night before she went to sleep.
One day, Sara and her mom went to the park. Sara brought Lily with her. She wanted to show Lily the flowers and the birds. She put Lily on a bench and ran to the swings. She had fun swinging high and low.
But then, the sky became dark and gray. Sara heard a loud noise. It was thunder. She saw flashes of light. It was lightning. She felt drops of water on her face. It was rain. Sara was scared. She ran to her mom.
"Mom, mom, it's raining! We have to go home!" Sara cried.
"OK, sweetie, let's go. But where is Lily?" her mom asked.
Sara gasped. She had forgotten Lily on the bench. She looked at the bench and saw Lily lying there, wet and dirty. Sara felt sad. She loved Lily. She did not want Lily to be hurt.
"Mom, Lily is there! She is wet! She is fragile! She might break!" Sara said.
Her mom understood. She knew Sara valued Lily very much. She ran to the bench and picked up Lily. She wrapped Lily in a towel and gave her to Sara.
"Don't worry, Sara. Lily will be OK. We will clean her and dry her and make her look pretty again. She is a strong doll. She can survive the rain. But next time, be careful with your toys. They are not only things. They are your friends." her mom said.
Sara nodded. She hugged Lily and said sorry. She thanked her mom for saving Lily. She learned a lesson. She would never leave Lily alone again. She would always take good care of her. She would always value her.
