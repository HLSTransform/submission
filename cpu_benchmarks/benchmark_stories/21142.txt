Once upon a time, there was a mom who wanted her child to feel safe. One day she brought him a special package. She put it on the floor and said "Watch!" The little boy was so excited. He watched his package carefully.
Inside the package there was a surprise. It was a big toy, a monster with lots of eyes! The little boy loved it so much. He hugged it tight and felt so safe.
The boy spent all day playing with his monster. He never wanted to leave it. Even at night, he fell asleep watching it and dreaming of all the fun they had had together.
The package brought lots of happy memories. The little boy had found a special friend!
