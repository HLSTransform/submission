Ben and Jen were twins who lived on a farm. They liked to play with the animals, but their favorite was Billy the goat. Billy was friendly and funny, and he liked to eat grass and carrots. Sometimes, he would let the twins ride on his back or pull them in a cart.
One day, Ben and Jen's mom told them that they had to go to the city with their dad for a week. They had to visit their grandma, who was sick. The twins were sad, because they would miss Billy and the other animals. They hugged Billy and said goodbye.
"Be good, Billy," Ben said. "We will come back soon."
"Don't worry, Billy," Jen said. "We will bring you a present."
Billy nodded and bleated. He watched them leave in the car.
While the twins were gone, Billy was lonely. He missed his friends, and he had no one to play with. He became bored and angry. He started to chew on the fence, the clothesline, and the flowers. He knocked over the buckets, the barrels, and the chairs. He made a big mess on the farm.
The farmer, who was Ben and Jen's uncle, was not happy. He scolded Billy and tied him to a tree. He said Billy was a bad goat, and he would not let him out until he learned to behave.
Billy felt sorry and sad. He realized he had been naughty, and he wished he could say sorry to the farmer. He wished Ben and Jen would come back soon.
After a week, Ben and Jen returned from the city. They had a lot of fun with their grandma, who was feeling better. They brought her a card, a cake, and some flowers. They also brought Billy a present: a new collar with a bell.
They ran to the farm, looking for Billy. They saw him tied to the tree, looking sad and dirty. They felt sorry for him, and they ran to hug him.
"Billy, we missed you so much!" Ben said.
"Billy, we are sorry you were alone!" Jen said.
They untied him and gave him his present. Billy was happy to see them, and he licked their faces. He bleated and shook his head, making the bell ring.
The farmer came out and saw them. He smiled and said he was glad they were back. He said he was sorry he had been harsh with Billy, but he hoped he had learned his lesson.
Billy nodded and bleated. He had learned his lesson. He was sorry he had been angry and made a mess. He decided he would be good and not chew on things he shouldn't.
Ben and Jen thanked the farmer and said they loved him. They said they loved Billy too, and they wanted to play with him. They asked the farmer if they could take Billy for a ride in the cart.
The farmer agreed and said they could. He said he was proud of them and Billy. He said they were a good family.
Ben, Jen, and Billy were happy. They rode in the cart, laughing and singing. They learned that being away from someone you love can make you miss them, but also make you appreciate them more. They learned that being angry can make you do bad things, but also make you sorry and want to do better. They learned that being good can make you happy, and also make others happy. They learned that love is the best present of all.
