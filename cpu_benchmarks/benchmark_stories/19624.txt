Once there was a girl named Sam. She was three years old and always liked to stare out of the window. One day, Sam stared and saw something very special in the night sky: a big, bright candle!
Sam was so happy that she ran outside to have a closer look. As she got closer, she noticed something strange. The candle seemed to be deaf!
Sam wondered why the candle couldn't hear her. She called out, but there was no answer. She thought maybe it needed some help, so she decided to stay up with it until morning.
When the sun came up, Sam smiled. She had made a new friend! The candle was grateful and thanked her by twinkling at her. From that day on, Sam and the candle were friends.
