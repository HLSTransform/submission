Once upon a time there lived two friends. Their names were Sammy and Julie. Every day they would have lunch together in a special spot. Sammy always brought his lunch to share, but not Julie. 
Today Sammy asked her, "Where is your lunch?". Julie said, "I don't have one. I don't have money for it." That made Sammy very unhappy. 
"It's not honest!" he said. "You should always be honest and share with friends!" 
Julie was sad. She didn't want to be mean, but she didn't have a lunch like Sammy. Just then, Sammy had an idea.
He shouted, "Grab my lunch! We can share it!" Julie was happy and grabbed the lunch. They shared it together and it was the best lunch ever!
