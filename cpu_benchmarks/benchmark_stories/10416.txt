Once upon a time, there was a little boy who had a good value about how to behave. He was always very careful to listen to his mom and dad and to be nice to his friends. He wanted to make sure he was tight with his behaviour.
One day, the little boy’s mom and dad were very tired and they asked him to watch his little brother while they took a nap. The little boy was worried, but he knew he had to behave.
He made sure his brother was safe and happy, and he was very tight with his behaviour. He played with him and made sure he didn’t get into any trouble. After a while, he even got his brother to help him clean up the mess they had made.
When the little boy’s parents woke up, they were so happy that he had done such a good job of behaving. They told him how proud they were and thanked him for having such good values. 
And from that day on, the little boy understood how important it was to behave, especially when other people depended on him.
