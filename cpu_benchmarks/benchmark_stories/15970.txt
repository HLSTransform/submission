Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pet mouse named Max. Max was very small and cute. Lily loved to play with Max, but sometimes he was noisy when he ran on his wheel at night. 
One day, Lily decided to study about mice. She read a book about how they like to eat cheese and run around. She also learned that mice have very good hearing and can hear things that humans can't. 
After studying, Lily decided to make Max a special treat of cheese. Max was very happy and ate it all up. Then, Lily played with Max quietly so he could take a nap. From then on, Max was still a little noisy, but Lily didn't mind because she loved him very much.
