Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's mom told him that they were going to a birthday party for his friend Sarah. Timmy was excited to go because he knew there would be lots of cake and presents.
At the party, Timmy saw a big box with a shiny bow on top. He knew it was a gift for Sarah. Timmy thought the box was very attractive and wanted to play with it. But his mom told him that the gift was not for him, it was for Sarah.
Later on, when it was time to open presents, Timmy saw that Sarah ignored the big box with the shiny bow on top. She opened all her other gifts first. Timmy wondered why Sarah didn't want to open the attractive gift. Finally, when all the other gifts were opened, Sarah opened the big box. Inside was a beautiful doll that Sarah had been wanting for a long time. Timmy realized that sometimes it's important to ignore things that are attractive to us, because they may not be the best gift for someone else.
