Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She loved to explore outside. One day, she ventured down to the beach. As she wandered around, she noticed a seal gazing upon her. He was curious and wanted to play! Sally was a bit ignorant of the seal's presence and kept walking. The seal made a noise which caught Sally's attention. She turned around and looked at the seal and it spoke to her.
"Why are you so ignorant? I just want to play with you," said the seal.
Sally smiled and finally understood. She slowly and carefully walked over to the seal. Gently, she held out her tiny hand. The seal smiled, and they played together. They laughed and giggled as they splashed around. Sally was so happy and grateful that she had found a new friend. They played until the sun went down, and Sally had to go home. She waved goodbye, and the seal waved back as she walked away.
