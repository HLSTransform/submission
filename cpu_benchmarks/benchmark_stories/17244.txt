Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and run around in her backyard. One day, her mommy mentioned that they were going to a big hall for a party. Lily was so excited! She loved parties and getting dressed up in pretty dresses.
As they drove to the hall, Lily's mommy noticed that she was getting anxious. "What's wrong, sweetie?" she asked. "I don't know," Lily replied. "I just feel funny." Her mommy explained that it was normal to feel a little nervous before a big event.
When they arrived at the hall, Lily's eyes widened in amazement. It was huge! There were balloons and streamers everywhere, and a big table full of yummy treats. Lily ran around, playing with the other children and having a great time.
As the party was winding down, Lily's mommy mentioned that they were going to have a surprise for her when they got home. Lily's heart raced with excitement. When they arrived home, her mommy led her to her bedroom, where a brand new dollhouse was waiting for her. Lily was overjoyed and hugged her mommy tightly, thanking her for such a wonderful day.
