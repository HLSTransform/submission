Today, Jake was playing in his room. He grabbed a small top from his toy box. Jake held the top and spun it around. He watched in amazement as it twirled, going faster and faster.
Jake's mom came in the room and smiled at him. "That looks like fun," she said.
"Yes! Look Mom! It spins!" Jake said.
Mom laughed. "Yes, it sure does! But it's getting late. Time for bed!"
Jake groaned. "Aww, just a few more minutes?"
Mom smiled and shook her head. "No, it's time for bed. Maybe tomorrow you can play with your top again."
Jake sighed. "Okay, Mom." He put the small top back in the box and walked to his bed. As he climbed in, he though about how much fun he had spinning his top today.
