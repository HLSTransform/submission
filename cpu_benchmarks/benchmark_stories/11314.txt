Once there was a beautiful refrigerator. It was so shiny and white that everybody wanted it. 
One day, a family wanted to buy it. So they loaded it onto their truck, and drove away with it. 
The family was so excited to have the beautiful refrigerator. They quickly unloaded it and placed it in their kitchen.
Inside the refrigerator was lots of yummy food and drinks. The little boy was so happy, he danced around the refrigerator. 
From then on, the family had lots of fun using the beautiful refrigerator. They put different foods and drinks inside to keep them cold and delicious. They were so pleased to have this wonderful appliance.
