Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved playing with his toy jet. He would make it fly all around the room, pretending he was a pilot.
One day, Tim's mom asked him to carry some groceries from the car into the house. Tim wanted to keep playing, but he knew he had to help his mom. He carried the bags inside, but he was very cold because it was winter.
After he finished helping his mom, Tim went back to playing with his jet. He made it fly higher and higher until it got stuck in a tree. Tim tried to get it down, but he couldn't reach it. He was very sad.
The next day, Tim's dad tried to get the jet down with a ladder, but he fell and got hurt. Tim felt guilty for causing his dad's injury. From then on, Tim always made sure to be careful when playing with his toys.
