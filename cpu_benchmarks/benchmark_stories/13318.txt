One day, a small cat named Kitty was walking by a big wall. She saw a ball stuck on top of the wall. Kitty wanted to get the ball down, but the wall was very hard to climb. She tried and tried, but she could not reach the ball.
Then, a dog named Buddy walked by. Kitty asked, "Can you help me get the ball?" Buddy said, "I will try!" He jumped and jumped, but the ball was still too high. They both felt sad.
Suddenly, a bird named Chirpy saw them. Chirpy asked, "What happened?" Kitty and Buddy told Chirpy about the ball. Chirpy said, "I can help!" She flew up, took the ball, and gave it to Kitty. They all became friends and played with the ball together.
