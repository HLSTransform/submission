Once upon a time there was a three year-old girl named Emily. One day, Emily was playing in her backyard when she saw a turkey. She was very excited. She wanted to get a closer look at the turkey and so she ran over and started talking to it.
Emily said, "Hello turkey! I'm Emily. What are you doing here?"
The turkey looked at Emily and said, "I'm here to include you in my Thanksgiving feast!"
Emily was not sure what to make of this. "What do you mean?" she asked the turkey.
The turkey said, "That means I am going to eat you! I'm going to make a Thanksgiving feast and include you!"
Emily thought the whole idea was disgusting and she ran away. Emily already had plans for Thanksgiving that didn't include getting eaten by a turkey!
