Once upon a time, there was a bald man. He wanted to marry a pretty girl, but he didn't know how. He asked his friend for some help.
His friend gave him a string. It was a special string because it could do magic. The bald man followed the instructions and tied the string onto his finger. He said some magical words and suddenly, all of his hair came back!
The bald man was so pleased. He now looked like a handsome prince! He then used the same magic string and asked the pretty girl to marry him.
The pretty girl said yes! The two of them were so happy they celebrated all night long. They lived happily ever after and never forgot the magic of the special string.
