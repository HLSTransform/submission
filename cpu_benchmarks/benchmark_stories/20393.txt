Once upon a time, there was a big brown horse named Brownie. Brownie loved to eat hay. One day, Brownie saw a juicy apple on the ground. He got so excited that he ran to get it. But when he tried to take a bite, he accidentally bit his own tongue! Ouch! 
Brownie didn't want to eat the apple anymore, so he went back to eating his hay. He was happy again. The end.
