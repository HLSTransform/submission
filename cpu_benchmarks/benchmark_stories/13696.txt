Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy went to the store with his mom. They were buying groceries for dinner. Timmy saw a big sign that said "SALE" and he got excited. He wanted to buy something, but he had zero money in his pocket. 
Suddenly, Timmy heard a loud shout from the other side of the store. It was his friend, Johnny. Johnny had found a toy that he really wanted. Timmy went over to see what Johnny had found. It was a little car that could go really fast. Timmy thought it was cool, but he knew he couldn't buy it because he had zero money. 
Timmy and Johnny played with the little car for a little while, but then it was time to go home. Timmy was sad that he couldn't buy the car, but he was happy that he got to play with it for a little bit. He learned that even if he had zero money, he could still have fun with his friends.
