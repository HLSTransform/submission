Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Seth. Seth was tired so he decided to go for a walk in the dark. He grabbed his flashlight and started to walk outside. He came to a clearing so he decided to sit down. Seth heard a noise. He shined his flashlight into the darkness. He saw a big bear! The bear was poking around with its big nose. Seth was scared so he got up quickly and ran away. The bear heard him and started to chase him. Seth was scared so he ran as fast as he could. He ran until he could not run anymore. He was so tired but he had made it to safety. Seth thanked his flashlight for keeping him safe.
