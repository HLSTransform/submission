Once upon a time there was an unusual butter. It looked different to any other butter before. All of the animals wondered what it was.
They all asked questions about the butter. One brave animal decided to try the unusual butter. He took a lick and it tasted so yummy! 
All the animals wanted some of the butter and so they each took a turn to try it. They liked it so much that they decided to keep some to eat later.
But then something strange happened. The unusual butter started to move! It slowly hopped away and disappeared before the animals could get it back! 
That was the end of the unusual butter and the animals were very sad. They never got to eat it again and never found out what it was!
