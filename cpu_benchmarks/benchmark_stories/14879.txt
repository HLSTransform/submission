Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, but one day, she saw a shiny toy in the store. It was so expensive, and she really wanted it. She asked her mom if she could buy it, but her mom said no.
Lily started to cry and whine, but her mom told her to resist the temptation to buy the toy. "It's too expensive," her mom said. "We can't afford it right now."
Lily was sad, but she listened to her mom. She went home and played with her other toys. Later that day, her mom surprised her with a new toy that didn't cost as much. "This is a great start to your toy collection," her mom said. Lily was so happy and gave her mom a big hug.
