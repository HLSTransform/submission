Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to drive. She had a toy car that she would push around the house all day long. One day, her parents took her to the beach. They saw a big boat with a unique anchor. The anchor was shaped like a star!
Lily was so excited to see the boat and the anchor. She asked her parents if they could go for a ride on the boat. Her parents said yes, but they warned her to be careful. They told her that the boat could be dangerous if she didn't listen to the captain.
Lily had so much fun on the boat, but she didn't listen to the captain. She tried to drive the boat herself, but she crashed it into a rock. The boat sank and Lily was very scared. Her parents had to rescue her and they were very upset. They told her that it was important to listen to grown-ups and not try to do things that were too big for her. From that day on, Lily knew that it was important to be safe and listen to grown-ups.
