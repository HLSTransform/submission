Once upon a time there was a family who wanted to visit the ocean. They wanted to see the whales, so they packed their bags and went to the beach.
When they arrived, they looked out over the water. Suddenly they saw a big, sleepy whale swimming near the shore. They waved, and the whale waved back! 
The family stayed for a while and watched the whale swim around. Soon it was time to go home, so the family thanked the whale for the visit and gave it a big goodbye.
The family went back home with happy memories of the sleepy whale. They looked forward to visiting again soon!
