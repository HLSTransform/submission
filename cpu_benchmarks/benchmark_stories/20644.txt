Once there was a jolly old man. He liked to give people good advice. One day, he recommended that a little girl get a special candle. She was so excited, she went to buy one right away! When she lit the candle, she felt so peaceful and happy.
The little girl was so pleased with the candle that she decided to recommend it to her friends. When they all lit their candles, the room was filled with warm light. It was like a special secret only the friends shared.
The old man was glad to see the little girl so happy. Whenever someone asked for advice, he always recommended the special candle. And everyone was always so pleased that they followed his advice.
The little girl and her friends still light their candles when they get together and the old man is always wondering what jolly new advice he can recommend next.
