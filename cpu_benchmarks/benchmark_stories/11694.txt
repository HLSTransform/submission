Once there was a small duck. He was swimming around and enjoying the day. He felt thirsty so he stopped and looked around. He saw a small pond near by and said: "I'm going to drink from that pond".
He waddled over and put his head down to take a drink. As he was drinking he heard some loud noise. He looked up and saw it was a farmer with his big tractor! The farmer was coming closer and closer.
The small duck ran away. He ran over the hill and into a small meadow. He lay down in the grass, trying to hide from the farmer. When the farmer had gone he looked around. He saw a small pond at the other side of the meadow. He said: "Perfect, I'll drink from here".
He slowly waddled over to the pond. He put his head down to take a drink and it tasted so nice! He drank some more, feeling refreshed. Finally he was ready to go back and enjoy the rest of his day.
