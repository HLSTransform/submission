John and Susie were playing with their dolls. John said, "My doll doesn't care about peace like your doll". Susie replied, "Your doll wants peace too, it's just not easy for her to find it like mine".
John thought for a moment and then said, "Maybe if we play together, our dolls can care for each other and peace will be easy".
So they played together, and their dolls found peace. They both knew that caring made finding peace a lot easier. And they were happy to have seen that caring can bring peace too.
