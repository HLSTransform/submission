Sam had a new bike. It was red and shiny and had two big wheels. He loved his bike and wanted to ride it every day. He put on his helmet and gloves and went outside.
He saw his friend Mia on the sidewalk. She had a new bike too. It was blue and sparkly and had a basket. She smiled at Sam and said, "Hi, Sam. Do you want to race with me?"
Sam nodded and said, "Yes, Mia. I want to race with you. My bike is very fast. I can speed like a car."
They lined up their bikes at the end of the street. They counted to three and then pedaled as hard as they could. They zoomed past the trees and the houses and the cars. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces.
But then, Sam saw something shiny on the road. It was a needle. It was sharp and pointy and dangerous. He tried to avoid it, but it was too late. His bike hit the needle and his front wheel popped. He lost his balance and fell off his bike. He scraped his knee and elbow and cried out loud.
Mia heard Sam's cry and stopped her bike. She turned around and saw Sam on the ground. She felt sorry for him and ran to help him. She said, "Oh, Sam. I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
Sam looked at his bike and his wound and said, "No, Mia. I'm not okay. My bike is broken and my knee and elbow hurt. The needle was bad. It ruined my new bike and my race."
Mia hugged Sam and said, "Don't worry, Sam. I'll get my mom. She can fix your bike and your wound. She has a band-aid and a pump. The needle was bad, but we can make it better. You're still my friend and we can race again another day."
