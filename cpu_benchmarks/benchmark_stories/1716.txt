Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toy soldiers and make them march around. One day, he saw his mom ironing his clothes. "What are you doing?" he asked. "I'm ironing your clothes so they look nice and neat," said his mom.
Timmy continued to play with his toy soldiers until his sister came in and knocked them over. "That was rude!" he said to his sister. "I'm sorry," she replied. "Let's play together nicely." They decided to make the soldiers march together and have a parade. 
As they marched around the room, Timmy noticed his mom watching them with a smile. "Mom, do you like our parade?" he asked. "I love it," she said. "You're both being so kind and having fun together." Timmy felt happy and proud that he made his mom happy. From that day on, he always tried to be kind to his sister and make his toy soldiers march in a friendly way.
