Once upon a time, there was a cute little dog named Spot. Spot loved summer because he could play outside all day. He liked to run, jump, and chase butterflies in the warm sun.
One day, Spot saw a butterfly that reminded him of a friend he had made last summer. The butterfly was yellow and blue, just like his friend. Spot was so happy to see the butterfly and wanted to play with it.
Spot chased the butterfly through the grass and over the hills. They played all day long, and when the sun went down, they were both very tired. Spot and the butterfly said goodbye and went to their homes. Spot couldn't wait for another fun summer day with his cute butterfly friend.
