Lila liked to play with her marbles. She had many marbles of different colors and sizes. She liked to roll them, sort them, and make patterns with them. She did not like to share her marbles with anyone.
One day, a new boy came to her preschool. His name was Max. He saw Lila playing with her marbles and wanted to join her. He asked her if he could play with some of her marbles. Lila said no. She said they were her marbles and she did not want to share.
Max was sad. He looked around and saw a big box of toys. He opened the box and found a magic wand. He did not know it was a magic wand, but he liked how it sparkled. He waved it in the air and said, "I wish I had some marbles too."
Suddenly, a lot of marbles appeared on the floor. They were all different colors and sizes, just like Lila's. Max was happy. He picked up some marbles and started to play with them. He rolled them, sorted them, and made patterns with them.
Lila saw Max playing with the marbles. She was angry. She said, "Hey, those are my marbles. You took them from me. Give them back." She ran to Max and tried to grab the marbles from his hands.
Max said, "No, they are not your marbles. They are my marbles. They appeared when I used this wand. You can't have them. You are bossy and mean."
Lila and Max started to fight over the marbles. They pulled and pushed and shouted. They did not notice that the teacher was watching them. The teacher came over and said, "Stop, stop, stop. What are you doing? Why are you fighting over the marbles?"
Lila and Max stopped fighting. They looked at the teacher and said, "He took my marbles. She did not share her marbles." They both pointed at each other.
The teacher said, "That is not nice. You should not take or keep things that are not yours. You should share and play nicely with each other. The marbles belong to the preschool, not to you. You can both play with them, but you have to take turns and be kind. Do you understand?"
Lila and Max nodded. They felt sorry for being rude and selfish. They said, "We are sorry, teacher. We understand." They gave each other some of their marbles and said, "Here, you can play with these. They are pretty and fun."
The teacher smiled. She said, "That's better. Now you are being good friends. You can keep playing with the marbles, but remember to put them back in the box when you are done. And don't forget to say thank you to the magic wand. It gave you a lesson and a gift."
Lila and Max said, "Thank you, magic wand. Thank you, teacher." They played with the marbles and had a good time. They learned to share and be nice. They did not fight anymore. They became good friends.
