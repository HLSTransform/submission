Once upon a time, there was a pretty flower named Rosie. Rosie lived in a garden with many other flowers. She wanted to bloom and be the most beautiful flower in the garden. But she was sad because she was not growing as fast as the other flowers.
One day, a van drove into the garden and accidentally ran over some of the flowers. Rosie was very sad and scared. She thought the van would hurt her too. But the gardener came and saved her from the van. The gardener told Rosie that she was special and beautiful just the way she was, and that she didn't need to bloom faster than the other flowers.
Rosie felt happy and stopped worrying about blooming. She realized that everyone is different and unique in their own way. From that day on, she enjoyed her time in the garden and didn't compare herself to the other flowers. And when she finally bloomed, she was the most beautiful flower in the garden, just like she always wanted.
