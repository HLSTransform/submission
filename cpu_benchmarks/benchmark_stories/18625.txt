Once upon a time, there was a baby named Timmy. Timmy loved his crib and would sleep in it every night. One day, Timmy's big sister Molly wanted to play with him. She asked him to follow her to the park. Timmy was excited and he followed her.
Molly was not honest with Timmy. She led him to a scary forest instead of the park. Timmy got scared and started crying. He wanted to go back to his crib. But Molly didn't care and left him alone in the forest.
Poor Timmy was lost and didn't know what to do. He cried and cried until a kind stranger found him and took him back home. The moral of the story is to always be honest and never lead someone into danger.
