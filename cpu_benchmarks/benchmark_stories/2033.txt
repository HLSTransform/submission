Once upon a time, there were two bunnies who were furry and cuddly. They loved to hop around and explore the world.
One day, the two bunnies saw a house on a hill with a great view of the valley. They wanted to see what it was like inside, so they hopped up to the door and knocked.
"Who is it?" a voice from inside shouted. The bunnies were surprised, and a little scared. But one of them was brave enough to answer.
"We're just two bunnies who want to see the view from your house," he said.
After a long wait, the door opened and a friendly old woman appeared. She smiled and invited the bunnies to come in and look out at the view.
The bunnies were so happy to see the valley. As they watched, the sun began to set and the sky melted into beautiful colors.
The bunnies took a deep breath and thanked the old woman.
"Always take the time to enjoy the beauty around you," she said.
The bunnies hopped back to their home, thinking about what the old woman had said. From that day on, they made sure to appreciate all the wonderful views in their lives and to never forget the beauty that melts away too quickly.
