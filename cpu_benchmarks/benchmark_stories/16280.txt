Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted to meet someone special. She looked around and saw a thin man walking in the park. She called out to him, "Hey mister. Can I meet you?" 
The man smiled and said, "Hello. My name is John. I'm happy to meet you!"
The little girl was very excited. She asked, "Do you want to play with me?"
John said, "Yes, I'd love to! Let's take our time and have fun!"
The little girl and John played games and laughed and sang until the sun went down. They had a wonderful time and the little girl was so happy to have made a new friend. She said goodbye to John and promised to see him again the next day.
