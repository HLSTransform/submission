Once upon a time, there was a pink bunny named Rosie. Rosie loved to eat lunch outside in the sun. One day, while she was eating her carrot sandwich, she saw a little bird stuck in a tree. The bird was crying for help.
Rosie knew she had to rescue the bird. She hopped over to the tree and climbed up to where the bird was stuck. She gently picked up the bird and brought it back down to the ground.
The bird was so happy to be rescued and thanked Rosie by singing a beautiful song. Rosie finished her lunch with the bird by her side, feeling proud that she was able to help someone in need. From that day on, Rosie and the bird became the best of friends and had many more adventures together.
