Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Adam. He had beautiful feathers and he loved to sing. He lived happily in the modern cage his owners had provided for him.
One day, Adam heard a strange sound outside the cage. He looked closely and saw another bird, one that had no cage. This bird was free to fly wherever it wanted and to sing whatever it wanted.
Adam said to the free bird, "I wish I had no cage too. Then I could fly high and sing loudly like you."
The free bird said, "You may have no cage like me, but you have a thing I don't have: love. Your owners love you. They provide you with a safe and modern cage, something very few birds can enjoy. Love is what makes life beautiful, even if there are cages involved."
The moral of this story is that love can make any situation better, no matter if it involves cages or not. Love is what brings joy and lightens our spirits. Without it, the world would be empty.
