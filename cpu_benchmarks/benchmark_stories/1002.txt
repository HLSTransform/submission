Once there was a little boy called Johnny. Johnny loved aeroplanes, he watched them flying in the sky all the time.
One day Johnny went outside to play in his garden. It was cold, but he didn't mind. He ran around, chasing the butterflies and making mud pies. Suddenly he heard a loud noise. It was an aeroplane flying in the sky. Johnny looked up and waved.
The aeroplane flew away and soon it was dark. Johnny was feeling cold so he went inside his house. He gave a big shiver and he was so glad to be warm again. His dad lit the fireplace and soon it was very cosy.
Johnny lay down on the sofa, feeling warm and cosy. He waved goodbye to the aeroplane until it disappeared into the night. As he went to sleep, he started to feel happy and relaxed. He was happy he had seen an aeroplane that day.
