Once there was a little girl named Abigail. She was very excited because her mom had a big surprise for her. Abigail's mom went to the freezer and got two bags of ice. She put them in the box and kept them hidden.
Abigail was very curious, so she asked her mom what was inside the box. Her mom said, "You'll have to wait until later to find out!"
Abigail waited until later when her mom opened the box. Inside was a big bowl full of ice cream! Abigail was so excited that she started to jump up and down. She quickly grabbed a spoon and started to eat. 
Abigail loved the ice cream so much that she asked if she could keep the rest of it. Her mom agreed and told her to keep the box in the freezer.
Abigail was very happy and carefully put the box back in the freezer. Now she can enjoy a cool treat whenever she wants!
