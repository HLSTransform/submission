Once there was a little girl who had very bad teeth. Every time she smiled, her teeth felt like prickly needles. Her mom told her that it was time to go to the dentist, so mom and daughter went.
At the dentist, the dentist looked in the little girl's mouth and said, "Oh my! Your teeth are very bad. We need to get them fixed." He then put a big, white smock on her and gave her a special cleaning tool. He said, "This will help supply your teeth with the things they need. Now, let's brush!"
The girl carefully brushed her teeth with the special tool and soon her teeth felt much better and looked so much brighter. She said, "Thank you for the supply for my teeth. They feel better now!" The dentist smiled and said, "You're welcome, little one."
And from that day forward, the little girl was always sure to supply her teeth with the proper care, so that her smile would stay bright and she could carry it proudly.
