Once upon a time, there was a little penguin named Pip. Pip loved to slide on the ice with his friends. One day, Pip saw his friend, Sammy, slide really fast on the ice. Pip was envious of Sammy's speed and wanted to be just as fast.
Pip practiced sliding every day, trying to go faster and faster. One day, Pip finally achieved the same speed as Sammy. Pip was so happy and proud of himself.
Pip and Sammy continued to slide on the ice together, laughing and having fun. Pip realized that it wasn't about being the fastest or the best, but about enjoying the time with his friends. From that day on, Pip was content with his own speed and happy to be with his friends.
