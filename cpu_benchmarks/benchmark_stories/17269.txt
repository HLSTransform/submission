Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily was playing in the living room when she saw a big white glass on the table. She wanted to play with it, but her mom said, "No, Lily. That glass is too fragile. It could break."
Lily didn't understand what "fragile" meant, so she asked her mom. "What does 'fragile' mean?" she said.
"It means that the glass is easily broken," her mom said. "We don't want it to break, do we?"
Lily thought for a moment, then said, "No, we don't want it to break. Let's count how many glasses we have instead!"
So Lily and her mom counted all the glasses in the house, and they found out they had ten. Lily was happy because she loved to count things. And her mom was happy too, because Lily didn't break the white glass. The end.
