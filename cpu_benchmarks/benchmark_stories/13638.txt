Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big melon on a table. The melon is green and round. It looks yummy.
"Who owns this melon?" Lila asks.
"I don't know. Maybe no one," Ben says.
"Can we have some?" Lila says.
"Maybe. But we need to cut it first," Ben says.
They look around. They see a clear knife on the table. The knife is shiny and sharp. It can cut the melon.
"Be careful with the knife," Lila says.
"I will," Ben says.
He picks up the knife. He tries to cut the melon. But the melon is too hard. He pushes harder. The knife slips. He cuts his finger. He drops the knife. He cries.
"Ow! Ow! Ow!" Ben says.
Lila sees blood on his finger. She is scared. She runs to him. She hugs him.
"Are you okay?" Lila says.
"No. It hurts. It hurts a lot," Ben says.
They hear a voice. It is a man. He is angry.
"Hey! What are you doing with my melon and my knife?" the man says.
He comes to the table. He sees the melon, the knife and the kids. He is very mad.
"That's my melon! That's my knife! You are bad kids! You are thieves!" the man says.
He grabs the melon and the knife. He chases the kids. The kids are very scared. They run away. They leave the park. They go home.
They never play with the melon and the knife again.
