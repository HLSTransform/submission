Once upon a time there was a lovely little girl called Molly. She was three years old and very excited about her first camping trip.
Molly was so excited to explore the woods around the campsite with her parents. Her mom had provided a dustpan and brush for collecting wood.
Molly went around gathering twigs and leaves with the dustpan and brush. Once she had filled the dustpan with wood and leaves, she ran back to the campsite to share the good news with her parents.
Molly showed them the dustpan filled with the wood and ash. Her father was so pleased and said, "Well done, Molly! You have collected enough wood and ash to start a fire and make dinner!" 
Molly was so excited and she helped her father build a fire in the camping stove. Once the fire was lit and dinner was cooking, Molly knew she had successfully provided dinner for her family. 
Molly proudly told her parents, "I'm so excited that I provided dinner." and they all smiled, content to be together around the campfire.
