Alice was a young girl living at home with her mom and dad. Every day, her mom and dad went to the university to learn and study. Alice loved watching them, but she couldn't go with them. One day, her mom and dad told her that when she grew up and was big enough, she could go to the university too!
Alice was excited and she asked many questions to learn more about college. Her mom explained that university was a fun place to learn and make new friends. She said that it wouldn't be easy, but with hard work, Alice would return home successful.
Alice soon forgot about university until one day her mom and dad both graduated. They had worked so hard and were now ready to celebrate their success. Alice was happy but she started to think about the future and wondered if one day she would return to university too.
Alice was not sure if the university would be easy, but she was determined to work hard. She knew if she stayed focused, she would be able to return just like her mom and dad.
