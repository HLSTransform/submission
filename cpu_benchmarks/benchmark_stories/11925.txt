Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Spidey. Spidey lived in a big, old house with lots of cobwebs. Spidey loved to make jokes and laugh with his spider friends.
One day, Spidey was crawling on a thin thread when he heard a loud noise. It was a little girl named Lily who had come to play in the old house. Spidey crawled down to say hello.
"Hi, Spidey!" Lily said with a big smile.
"Hi, Lily!" Spidey said. "Do you want to hear a joke?"
"Yes, please!" Lily said, giggling.
Spidey told Lily a funny joke and they both laughed. But suddenly, Lily saw a big cobweb near her face and got scared.
"Spidey, there's a scary cobweb!" Lily said, pointing.
"Don't worry, Lily," Spidey said. "I'll take care of it."
Spidey crawled up to the cobweb and spun a new, stronger web to catch it. Lily was amazed and thanked Spidey for being so brave. From that day on, Spidey and Lily were good friends and always shared jokes and laughs.
