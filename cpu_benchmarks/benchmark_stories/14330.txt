Jane was at the beach on her holiday. She was trying to catch some small fish but was having no luck. Her friend Sam came running up to her with a jar in his hand. He said, "I found a tiny fish! I'm gonna take it home with me." 
Jane said, "No, you can't! You can't take it away from its home."
Sam said, "It's too small and it can't do anything. I'm taking it." 
Jane pleaded, "Please don't. It's not yours."
Sam said, "You can't stop me!" He picked it and put it in his jar.
The little fish was swimming around in the jar, and Jane felt so sad. She tried to take the fish out of the jar, but Sam wouldn't let her. He said he wouldn't give it back and that Jane was too small to do anything anyway. 
Jane sadly watched as Sam ran away with the fish, and she knew there was nothing she could do. She wished she had been a bit bigger and stronger so she could have saved the little fish. But it was too late â€” the holiday had ended with a bad ending.
