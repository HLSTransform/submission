Once there was a little boy named Colin. One day Colin was riding in the car with his parents. His parents were talking about the driver of their car.
"That driver is smelly," Colin's dad said.
At first Colin did not know what his dad meant. He looked out the window and saw the driver of their car. He was a big man with a big mustache.
Colin thought hard about what he dad said. Finally, he shouted, "Oh, I get it!"
"What?" his mom asked.
"My dad means the driver is rude!" Colin said. "We should always be polite and call people 'sir' or 'ma'am'."
Colin's parents were very proud of him. They had learned an important lesson. Being polite and calling people 'sir' or 'ma'am' is always the right thing to do!
