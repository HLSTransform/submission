Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a wallet on the bench. It is brown and has a zipper.
"Wow, look at this!" Tom says. He opens the wallet and sees some money and cards.
"Maybe we can buy some ice cream with the money," Sam says.
"No, that is not nice. The wallet belongs to someone else. We should give it back," Tom says.
"But how do we find the owner?" Sam asks.
Tom looks at the cards. He sees a picture of a man and a name. He also sees a phone number.
"Maybe we can call this number and ask," Tom says. He takes out his phone and dials the number.
"Hello?" a voice says.
"Hello, is this Mr. Lee?" Tom asks.
"Yes, who is this?" the voice says.
"My name is Tom. I found your wallet in the park. Do you want it back?" Tom says.
"Really? You found my wallet? Oh, thank you so much! You are very kind and honest. Where are you?" the voice says.
"We are in the park, near the big slide. Can you come and get it?" Tom says.
"Yes, of course. I will be there in a few minutes. Thank you again, Tom. You made my day," the voice says.
Tom and Sam wait for Mr. Lee. He arrives soon and hugs them. He gives them a reward for finding his wallet. He says they are perfect kids.
Tom and Sam are happy. They decide to use the reward to buy some ice cream for themselves and for Mr. Lee. They enjoy the ice cream and chat with Mr. Lee. They make a new friend.
