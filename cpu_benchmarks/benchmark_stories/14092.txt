Once upon a time there were two friends, Jojo and Mika.
One day, they wanted to go on an adventure. So they made a plan: they wanted to look for the biggest root they could find.
Mika said, "Let's find the brownest root ever!"
Jojo agreed and said, "Let's go look for it right now!"
They excitedly ran into the woods, searching high and low, until they found the perfect root. It was big and brown and beautiful.
Mika exclaimed, "Look Jojo, this is the one we were looking for!"
Jojo smiled and said, "We did it! We found the biggest and brownest root!"
The two friends happily went home, happy that their plan had worked. The end.
