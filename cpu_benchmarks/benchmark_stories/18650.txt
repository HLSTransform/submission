Once upon a time, there was a big elephant named Ellie. Ellie loved to eat lots of yummy food and she became very fat. One day, Ellie's friend, a wise owl, came to visit her. The owl said, "Ellie, you should try doing yoga. It can help you feel better and not be so fat."
Ellie didn't know what yoga was, so the owl explained, "Yoga is when you move your body in different ways to help you feel healthy and strong." Ellie was excited to try it, so the owl taught her some yoga poses.
At first, Ellie found it hard to do the poses. But the owl reminded her to breathe and take it slow. Eventually, Ellie got the hang of it and felt much better. She even lost some weight!
From then on, Ellie did yoga every day and felt happy and healthy. She thanked the owl for reminding her to try something new.
