Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls, especially her famous Barbie figure. One day, Lily's mom asked her to wear a pretty dress for a special occasion. 
Lily replied, "But Mommy, I want to wear my new Barbie dress instead!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "Okay, you can wear your Barbie dress, but don't forget to put on your shoes too." 
Lily quickly put on her shoes and ran to show her Barbie figure her pretty dress. "Look Barbie, I'm wearing a dress just like you!" she exclaimed. 
Barbie smiled back at her and said, "You look beautiful, Lily!" Lily was so happy that her favorite toy complimented her outfit. From that day on, Lily wore her Barbie dress every chance she got, and she always remembered to show her famous figure her new outfits.
