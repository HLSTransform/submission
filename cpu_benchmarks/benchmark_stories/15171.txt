Once there was a little girl. Her name was Emily.
Emily was playing with her blocks. She had lots of colourful blocks. They were round blocks and square blocks.
Today, Emily chose a yellow brick. It was the biggest yellow brick. She held it in her hand.
Emily looked up at the sky and said, "What should I make with this yellow brick?"
Suddenly, she heard a voice from above. It was a little bird.
The bird said, "Make a castle with your yellow brick, Emily!"
Emily smiled. She set to work building a castle with her yellow brick. When she was finished, it was a beautiful castle.
Emily said, "Thank you, little bird!"
The bird flew away. Emily was happy she had chosen the yellow brick.
