Once there was a girl who liked to bake in her kitchen. Every day she would gather all of her ingredients and mix them together with a spoon. Then she would put the dough in the oven and make delicious treats.
One day she decided to play a game with her treats. She could make a different shape with each one. She cut the cookies different way and made shapes like stars, circles, and hearts.
But suddenly things started to get uncomfortable. The kitchen became hot and the cookies were smoking. The girl was worried and tried to put the oven off. But it was too late. The cookies were all burnt.
The girl was disappointed but she still wanted to play her game. So she got some new ingredients and started baking again. This time she made sure to use a timer so she would know when the cookies were finished.
And this time, they came out perfect! The girl smiled and clapped her hands. She was so happy to play her cookie game.
