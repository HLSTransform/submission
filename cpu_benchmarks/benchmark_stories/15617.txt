Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. The park has a wide path with flowers and trees. Anna and Ben like to skip on the path and look at the flowers and trees.
One day, they see a small dog on the path. The dog is brown and fluffy. It has a red collar with a bell. The dog looks at Anna and Ben and wags its tail. Anna and Ben think the dog is adorable.
"Hello, doggy!" Anna says. "What is your name?"
The dog barks and runs to Anna and Ben. It licks their faces and jumps on them. Anna and Ben giggle and pet the dog.
"His name is Toby," a voice says. Anna and Ben look up and see a girl with a leash. She is the dog's owner. "He likes to play with new friends. Do you want to play with him?"
"Yes, please!" Anna and Ben say. They take turns holding the leash and skipping with Toby. The girl joins them and they have fun. They skip and play until it is time to go home. They say goodbye to Toby and the girl and promise to come back soon. Anna and Ben are happy. They have made a new friend.
