Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to dance and move her body to music. One day, she heard some jazz music playing and it made her want to dance even more. She started to move her arms and legs to the beat of the music.
As she danced, she accidentally bumped into a table and knocked over a vase. The vase fell on the floor and broke into many pieces. Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. She knew she had to tell her mom, but she was afraid of getting in trouble.
When her mom came into the room, she saw the broken vase and asked Lily what happened. Lily told her the truth and her mom hugged her and said it was okay. She explained that accidents happen and that it was just a rough moment. From then on, Lily knew that it was always better to tell the truth, even if it was scary.
