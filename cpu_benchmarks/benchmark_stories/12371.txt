Once there was a beautiful red bird. Everywhere he went, he spread joy and cheer. He liked to soar high up in the sky and make everyone smile.
One day, he wanted to give his friends something special. So he decided to bring them some cereal. He carefully chose a box of brightly coloured cereal with shapes he knew his friends would like.
When he got back to the nest, everyone was ready to share the cereal. All of them were so excited.
The bird said “Let’s all eat together!”. And so they did, feeling happy and content after their snack.
Finally, when they were all full, they watched as the red bird soared away into the sky. His friends smiled and waved until he was out of sight.
