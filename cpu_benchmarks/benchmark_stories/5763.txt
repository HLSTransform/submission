One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. They noticed a small, serious dog sitting by a tree. Tim wanted to pet the dog, so he walked up to it with his mom.
"Can I pet the dog, Mom?" Tim asked. His mom said, "Yes, but be gentle." Tim put out his finger and touched the dog's soft fur. The dog wagged its tail and seemed to like Tim.
Tim and the dog played together in the park all day. They ran, jumped, and laughed. When it was time to go home, Tim waved goodbye to the dog. He knew they would see each other again soon.
