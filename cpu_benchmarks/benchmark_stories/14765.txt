Lily and her mom went to the park. Lily liked to play on the swings and the slide. She saw an old woman sitting on a bench. The old woman had white hair and a big smile.
Lily ran to the old woman and said hello. The old woman said hello back and asked her name. Lily told her her name and asked the old woman's name. The old woman said her name was Anna. Anna said she liked to come to the park and watch the birds and the children.
Lily asked Anna if she could sit with her. Anna said yes and moved over. Lily sat next to Anna and leaned on her. Anna put her arm around Lily and hugged her. Lily felt warm and happy. She liked Anna. Anna liked Lily. They talked and laughed and watched the park. Lily and Anna became friends.
