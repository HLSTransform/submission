Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a modest cat. This cat was black and very kind. She had many friends in the woods.
One sunny day, the black cat met a little bird. The little bird was sad. "Why are you sad?" asked the cat. The bird said, "I lost my way home. Can you help me find it?" The cat smiled and said, "I promise to help you."
They walked and walked until they found the little bird's home. The bird was very happy. "Thank you, black cat," said the bird. The cat said, "You're welcome, little bird. Friends help each other."
From that day on, the black cat and the little bird became best friends. They played together every day, and the woods were filled with their laughter.
