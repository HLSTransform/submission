Once upon a time, there was a big, blue bird. The bird was very patient. It liked to sit and watch the clouds. One day, the bird saw a little girl. She was sad.
The bird went to the girl and said, "Why are you sad?" The girl looked up and said, "I want to see the sky up close, but I can't fly." The bird smiled and said, "I can help you. I can soar high in the sky."
The next day, the girl and the bird met again. The bird was ready to show the girl how it could soar. The girl climbed on the bird's back. They went up, up, up into the sky. The girl was so happy. She saw the sky up close, just like she wanted.
After they came back down, the girl hugged the bird. She said, "Thank you, patient blue bird! You made my dream come true." The bird was happy to help. From that day on, they were the best of friends.
