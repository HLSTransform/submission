Once upon a time there was a duck. He was yellow and liked to swim in a pond nearby. Every day, the duck liked to take his rake and make a sandcastle.
One day, the duck noticed a soft toy by the edge of the pond. He wondered who the toy belonged to and walked closer to take a better look.
Suddenly, the duck heard a small voice from behind a bush. "Are you my toy?" it asked.
The duck smiled and said, "Yes, I think so." He accepted the toy and brought it to the pond.
Soon after, the duck found a rake and started raking the sand around him. He used the rake to make a soft pile of sand and placed the toy on top. The duck smiled as he watched the toy, happy that it was now in a good home.
