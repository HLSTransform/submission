Jane was a three-year-old girl who loved to play. She'd been playing in the house all day, until she heard a whisper from outside. It was coming from a little nearby park. Jane wanted to explore, but she was very scared.
She nervously walked over to the park and stepped inside. Suddenly, she saw a phone lying on the ground. She ran over to look at it. The phone was old and rusty.
Jane looked all around, wondering what to do with the phone. Then she decided to take it with her, so she picked it up and put it in her pocket.
When Jane came home, she showed her mum the phone and told her what she had taken. Her mum was not very happy. She told Jane that taking things that don't belong to her was wrong. Jane was so ashamed.
Jane felt like she had made a mistake and she wanted to make it right. She asked her mum what she should do and her mum said she should call the person who had lost the phone.
So Jane decided to call the number on the phone. When a voice answered, she told them she had the phone and asked them to come pick it up. The person was so happy to have their phone back.
Jane was relieved that she had done the right thing. She was glad she had made the right decision.
