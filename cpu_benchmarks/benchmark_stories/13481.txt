Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went on a walk in the forest. She saw a big black bird called a raven sitting on a tree branch. She said, "Hello Mr. Raven, what are you doing?" The raven replied, "I'm busy looking for food to eat."
Lily continued on her walk and saw her friend Emily. Emily waved at Lily and said, "Hi Lily, what are you doing?" Lily replied, "I'm going for a walk in the forest. I saw a raven who is busy looking for food to eat."
As they continued walking, they saw a beautiful flower garden. Lily and Emily waved at the flowers and said, "Hi flowers, you look so pretty!" The flowers waved back in the wind. Lily and Emily had a fun day in the forest, waving at all the animals and nature around them.
