Once upon a time, there was a purple creature. It liked to play in the garden and do funny things. One day, the creature decided to take a turn. But as it started to turn, it felt a strange feeling. It was scared!
The creature looked around and noticed a huge tree. It had big leaves and strong branches. It seemed like it could settle on the tree and be safe.
But the creature realized something else. At the top of the tree was a scary green monster. He was roaring and hissing and seemed very angry! The creature got scared and started to run away.
But the creature decided to be brave. It slowly took a turn and settled on the tree. The purple creature was shaking but it stood firm.
After a few moments, the green monster settled too. It said, "My name is Jon. I'm friendly, don't be scared."
The creature was so happy! It was not scared anymore and it made a new friend. And so, the purple creature and the green monster became friends and played together every day!
