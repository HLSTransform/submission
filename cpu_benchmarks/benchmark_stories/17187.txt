Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park near her house. One day, Lily saw a sad boy sitting by a bush. She went over to him and asked why he was sad. The boy said he lost his toy car and couldn't find it.
Lily felt compassionate towards the boy and wanted to help him. She looked around the bush and found the toy car. The boy smiled and thanked Lily. But then, Lily saw the boy's father frown at him for losing the toy car.
Lily didn't like seeing the boy sad again, so she told his father she found the toy car. The father was happy and thanked Lily. From that day on, Lily and the boy became good friends and played together in the park every day.
