Once upon a time there was a competitive knob. He was a very busy knob, always signing things. Every day, he signed more and more things. One day, the competitive knob decided to have a competition. He asked all of his friends from around the world to meet in his home. They all agreed and showed up.  
When they arrived, the competitive knob gave everyone a sign to sign. He explained that whoever could sign the most in one minute, would win the competition. Everyone started signing as quickly as they could. The competitive knob watched with a smile on his face. 
After one minute, the competitive knob stopped the competition. He looked around the room to see who had signed the most papers. To his surprise, it was a three year old child! Everyone cheered and clapped as the little child proudly walked up to the knob to receive his prize. 
The knob was very pleased with the child's performance, so he invited the child to be his special guest. From then on, the knob and the child were the best of friends. The child visited the knob every day to sign more and more papers. 
It was a magical time of friendship and competition!
