Once there was a cute purple bear. He liked to play in the park each day. He liked to play tag, hide and seek and even run around in the grass. One day a girl came to the park to play. She saw the cute purple bear and asked "Can I play too?"
The bear said, "Of course!" So, they both played all day. The girl and the bear chased each other and laughed. The sun was setting and they knew they had to go home, so they said goodbye. 
The girl said, "Let's play again tomorrow." The bear smiled and said, "Yes, let's play tomorrow!" 
The girl skipped home with a smile in her heart and the bear went back to his den. They had had a fun day playing together.
