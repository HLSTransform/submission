Once there was a boy called Jonny. Jonny loved to play golf, but he always felt troubled. One day, he saw a big tree filled with golden apples. Jonny thought the apples would be perfect to play golf with. 
So Jonny spread the golden apples out so they were far away from the tree. But the apples began to roll back to the tree. Jonny tried his hardest, but he couldn't stop them.
He was feeling very troubled. Then a big man appeared and said, "Don't worry. I can help you." 
The man picked up all the apples and spread them out far away from the tree. Jonny thanked the man and they were able to play golf with all the golden apples.
