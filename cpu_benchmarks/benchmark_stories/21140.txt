Once upon a time, there was a lonely board floating in the sea. Every day, it watched the other boards around it, but it never joined them. It just stayed still, alone in the sea.
One day, a little boy decided he wanted to play with the lonely board. He reached out his arms, grabbed the board and began to run. The little boy imagined all the games he could play with it.
Soon, the little boy came to a big, open field. He put the board down and started to watch. After a while, some other kids came to the field and the little boy asked if they wanted to join him with the board.
The kids agreed, and soon they were all playing and having fun. The lonely board was no longer alone.
The little boy watched and grinned. He had seen the lonely board, and now it was happy again.
