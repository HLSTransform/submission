Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She liked to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One night, Lily had a nightmare. She woke up crying and scared. Her mommy came to her room and hugged her. "It's okay, my dear," she said. "You just had a bad dream."
Lily's mommy sat with her until she fell asleep again. The next morning, Lily woke up feeling peaceful. She had a good breakfast and went to play with her toys. Suddenly, her daddy walked in and sneezed. "Bless you!" Lily said. Her daddy smiled and hugged her. It was a happy day for Lily.
