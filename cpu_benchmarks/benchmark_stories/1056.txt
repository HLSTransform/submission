Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was three years old, and her name was Mia. Mia was at home with her mom, and it was time for the mailman to come by. Mia was very scared when the mailman knocked on the door. 
Her mom opened the door, and the mailman handed her a big stack of mail. Mia's mom thanked him, and the mailman said goodbye.
Mia's mom put the mail on the kitchen table, and Mia wanted to go look at it. She slowly crept up to the table and grabbed a letter that had her name printed on it. She was so excited!
Mia's mom saw her daughter sitting at the table, and asked her if she wanted to help her deliver the mail. Mia shouted "Yes!" and grabbed the mail. She went to each mail box in the neighborhood and put the mail inside.
Mia was so proud of herself. She had done an important job, and she couldn't stop smiling. She felt brave and strong.
The end.
