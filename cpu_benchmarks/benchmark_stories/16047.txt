Once upon a time there was a bear living amongst the trees in a deep, dark forest. The bear, who was named Bearby, really wanted to be successful. He wanted to find a way to show everyone he could be the best.
One day, as he was wandering around in the forest, he found a long, furry whip. Immediately, he knew he had found the answer. He had to use the whip to settle any disputes or disagreements in the forest.
The next day Bearby set out to show off his new whip. He gathered the creatures of the forest and told them the whip was going to be the way they would settle disputes. He said, "I will find a way to make everyone successful."
The other animals were hesitant at first, but after he had settled a few problems and more people visited to watch, they began to agree with him. Then he was known as the successful and wise Bearby, the one who settled disputes with a whip.
