Once upon a time, there was a little rat. The rat liked to kick a ball. One day, the rat went to the park to play. He saw a big cat. The cat was looking for a friend to play with.
The rat asked the cat, "Do you want to play with me? I have a ball we can kick." The cat said, "Yes, I would like to play with you, rat. I have no available friends to play with today."
So, the rat and the cat played together. They kicked the ball back and forth. They laughed and had fun. They became good friends. From that day on, the rat and the cat always played together at the park.
