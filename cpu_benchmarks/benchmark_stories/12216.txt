Once upon a time there was a little princess. She was very sad. She had been sad for a very long time.
One day a prince rode up on a horse. The prince smiled at her and said, "Why are you so sad, princess?"
The princess just looked at him and said nothing. She was too sad to speak. 
The prince looked at her for a few moments and said, "Let me help you. I know some people who can make you happy." 
The princess stared at the prince for a few moments, then she smiled. They rode off together on the prince's horse and went to find the people who could make the princess happy. 
And they did. The princess smiled again and she was happy.
