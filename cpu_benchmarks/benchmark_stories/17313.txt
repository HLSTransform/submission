Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream and always ate it with a spoon. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and dad. They bought her a big scoop of ice cream.
As she was eating, Lily saw a little bird on the ground. It was very cold and shivering. Lily felt grateful for her warm coat and wanted to help the bird. She picked it up and held it close to her chest.
Suddenly, Lily felt very cold. She looked down and saw that her ice cream had fallen on her coat. It was all over her and had made her very cold. She started to shiver and her mom and dad had to take her home.
When they got home, Lily was still shivering. Her mom and dad tried to warm her up, but she wouldn't stop shivering. They called the doctor and he said that Lily had caught a cold. Lily was sad and didn't want to eat ice cream again. She knew that it was the ice cream that had made her freeze.
