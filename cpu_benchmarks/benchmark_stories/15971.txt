Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Benny. Benny loved to play in the forest with his friends. One day, Benny's tummy started to hurt, so he ran to his mommy and said, "Mommy, I need to go to the toilet!" 
Benny's mommy took him to the toilet and waited outside for him. Benny felt sad because he didn't want to be alone in the toilet. But then he remembered that his mommy was just outside waiting for him, so he felt a little better.
After Benny finished in the toilet, he went back to playing with his friends. He was happy again and didn't remain sad for long. The end.
