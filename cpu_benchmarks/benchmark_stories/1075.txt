Once upon a time, a little girl was walking through the woods. She was carrying an axe and looking for something to do. Suddenly, she saw a store ahead. When she got closer, she noticed that it was a fake store! The little girl was so excited. 
She started to explore the store, looking at all of the fake things. There were fake bags and fake shoes and even a fake axe! She picked up the fake axe and started to play with it. She chopped some fake trees in the store and pretended to be like a real lumberjack. 
Suddenly, she heard a noise coming from outside. It was the storekeeper! He came in and saw what the little girl was doing with the axe. He shouted at her and said, "Put down that axe!" 
The little girl quickly put down the fake axe and ran away. She never went back to the fake store again!
