Once upon a time, there was a happy child. The child loved to play with a ball and would roll it around all day. One day, the child found an empty box and decided to play with it too. The child rolled the box around and had so much fun.
But then, the box rolled too far away and the child couldn't reach it. The child tried to run after it, but tripped and fell. The child got hurt and had to go to the hospital. The box was never seen again and the child was sad. The end.
