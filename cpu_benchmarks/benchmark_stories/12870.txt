Once there was a little boy who loved playing with his toy stove. Every day he would take his toy and set up a pretend kitchen in his living room. He would stir the imaginary food, turn on the flame and enjoy pretending he was a real cook. 
One day, something strange happened. When he started to stir, a real flame came out of the toy stove! The little boy was very serious and he knew he needed help quickly. 
He ran to his mother, who was very surprised. She quickly turned off the flame and took the little boy outside to safety. 
Once outside, the boy and his mother thanked their lucky stars that nothing serious had happened. He promised his mother to never play with the stove again and she promised to keep a closer eye on him. 
The little boy never forgot the flame and it reminded him always to be careful when playing with pretend things.
