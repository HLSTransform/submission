Once upon a time there was a little boy. He liked to play in the kitchen. One day he was playing with a silly toy there. His mommy walked in and saw him. She wanted to encourage him to do something else. She said "Let's do something new!" She grabbed a book and they sat down in the kitchen. She read to him and he loved it. The boy smiled and laughed as he listened. His mommy was so happy to see him having fun. She continued to encourage him to try different things. The little boy had so much fun with his mommy that day. He was glad she had encouraged him to try something new.
