Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. She was playing in the park one sunny day with her best friend, Jack. They were running and laughing, enjoying the lovely weather. Suddenly, the sky turned grey and it started to rain!
Jack shouted, “Oh no! Now what?”
Emma giggled and said, “Don't worry. I have an idea.” She held up a yellow umbrella with a smile and opened it up. Jack's eyes lit up and he said, “That's a great idea!” 
So they ran over to a nearby tree and stood under the umbrella. They watched the rain for a few minutes and then Jack said, “Look, here comes Mum!” 
Sure enough, a few minutes later, Mum arrived. She was carrying two umbrellas: one yellow and one blue. Emma and Jack ran over to her and hugged her. Mum said, “I'm so glad I remembered to bring umbrellas, now you two don't have to get wet!” 
And they all lived happily ever after!
