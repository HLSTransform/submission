Once upon a time, there were two friends. They were playing at the park. The sun was shining and it was very nice.
The friends saw a window at the park. They wanted to look in the window. It was too high for them to reach. So, the first friend said, "I know! I can zip to the window." He ran as fast as he could to the window and he zipped over to it.
The two friends looked in the window. Inside, they saw a nice room. There were colourful toys and cosy cushions. The friends were very excited. 
In the corner of the room, they saw a big box with a bow on it. What was inside the box? It was a surprise.
The friends had a nice time at the window. They waved goodbye and zipped away.
