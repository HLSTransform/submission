Once upon a time, there were two friends named Bob and Jane. They both lived on a sunny island. 
One day, Bob and Jane went to the big beach and decided to build a ship. They used sticks, leaves and stones to build the ship. 
Bob and Jane launched the ship into the water. It was so exciting! But the waves were too big and the ship started to wobble. Bob said, "We need balance!" 
Jane smiled and said, "I know what to do!" She brought a big hairy animal over to the ship. The animal stood on its back feet and balanced the ship. Bob and Jane cheered and went for a ride with the hairy animal.
They had so much fun!
