Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy was playing with his toys. He had a toy car, a toy train, and a toy airplane. Suddenly, his toy airplane disappeared! Timmy looked everywhere but he couldn't find it.
He asked his mommy, "Where did my airplane go?" His mommy replied, "I don't know, it disappeared into the universe."
Timmy didn't understand what that meant, but he knew it must be far away. He felt grumpy and sad because he loved that toy airplane. His mommy said, "Don't worry, we can buy you a new one." But Timmy didn't want a new one, he wanted his old one back.
Then, Timmy's daddy came home and asked what was wrong. Timmy told him about his toy airplane disappearing. Daddy said, "Let's go look for it together." They searched and searched until finally, they found the toy airplane in a pile of clothes. Timmy was so happy and he hugged his daddy tight. Daddy said, "See, it didn't disappear forever. Sometimes things just get lost and we have to look for them."
