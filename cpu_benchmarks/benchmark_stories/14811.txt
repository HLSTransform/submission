Tim and Mia liked to play near the sea. They saw many boats and birds and shells. One day, they found a big metal thing on the sand. It had a pointy end and a round end with holes.
"What is this?" Tim asked.
"I think it is an anchor," Mia said. "It is for holding boats in one place."
"Wow, it is enormous!" Tim said. "How did it get here?"
"Maybe a big storm brought it," Mia said. "Or maybe a giant whale dropped it."
They tried to lift the anchor, but it was too heavy. They decided to play around it instead. They pretended it was a castle, a rocket, and a dragon. They had a lot of fun.
Then they heard a loud whistle. It was their mom, calling them for lunch. They ran to her, waving goodbye to the anchor.
"Mom, look what we found!" Tim said.
"An anchor? That's amazing!" Mom said. "Where did it come from?"
"We don't know," Mia said. "But we had a great time with it!"
Mom smiled and hugged them. She was happy they were curious and creative. She gave them sandwiches and juice, and they told her all about their adventure.
