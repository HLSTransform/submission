Once upon a time, there was a boy named Pete. Pete was very curious and loved to explore things.
One day, Pete found an old box. He opened the box and saw a lot of sparkly things inside. He knew these sparkly things must be magic. He wanted to examine them and see what they could do.
He touched one of the sparkly things and - poof! A unicorn appeared! Pete was so excited. The unicorn was so impressive. The unicorn said to Pete, "I can grant you any wish you want!"
Pete thought for a bit before he replied to the unicorn. He said, "I want to always explore and find magic like you!" 
The unicorn nodded and said, "Your wish is granted!" Pete thanked the unicorn and waved goodbye as it disappeared in a bright sparkle. 
From then on, Pete always explored and found new and exciting magic everywhere he went.
