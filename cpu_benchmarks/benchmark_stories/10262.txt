Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo was very curious and always wanted to explore the ocean. One day, Nemo saw a big shark swimming towards him. Nemo was scared and didn't know what to do. 
The shark saw that Nemo was scared and asked him why. Nemo explained that he was scared of sharks because he heard they were mean. The shark smiled and said, "Don't be scared of me. I'm a smart shark and I know that being mean doesn't make friends." 
Nemo was surprised and thanked the shark for being kind. From that day on, Nemo and the shark became friends and explored the ocean together. Nemo learned that not all sharks are mean and that it's important to not judge someone before you get to know them.
