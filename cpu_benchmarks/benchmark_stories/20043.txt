Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to take showers because they made her feel clean and fresh. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help store some toys in her room. Lily was happy to help and put all of her toys in a big box.
Later that day, Lily went to play with her friend, Max. Max was a nosy dog who always wanted to know what Lily was doing. Lily didn't mind though, she thought Max was funny. They played together until it was time for Lily to go home.
When she got home, Lily remembered that she forgot to put her towel in the bathroom after her shower. She went to get it and saw that Max was using it as a bed! Lily giggled and gently took the towel away from Max. She hung it up and went to bed, happy that she helped store her toys and that Max was still a silly, nosy dog.
