Tommy was a playful boy who liked to wake up early and run around the house. He had a big stomach that was always hungry for breakfast. One morning, he woke up before his mom and dad and decided to make some toast by himself. He climbed on a chair and reached for the bread and the toaster.
"Tommy, what are you doing?" his mom asked, coming into the kitchen. She saw him holding the bread and the toaster cord. "That's dangerous, Tommy. You could get hurt. Let me help you."
But Tommy did not listen. He wanted to do it by himself. He plugged the toaster into the wall and pushed the bread inside. He smiled and waited for the toast to pop out.
Suddenly, there was a loud bang and a flash of light. The toaster had exploded and sparks flew everywhere. Tommy screamed and fell off the chair. His mom ran to him and hugged him. She smelled something burning. She looked at Tommy's stomach and saw a big red mark. The toaster cord had touched his stomach and burned him.
"Tommy, Tommy, are you okay?" she asked, crying. She picked him up and ran to the phone. She called the doctor and told him what happened. She said they needed to go to the hospital right away.
Tommy was not okay. He was in a lot of pain and he was scared. He wished he had listened to his mom and not played with the toaster. He learned a hard lesson that day. He never tried to make toast by himself again.
