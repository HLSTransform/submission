Once upon a time, there was a poor little bunny. He didn't have much to eat, so he went to his friend's house. His friend gave him a big carrot to eat. The bunny was very happy and said, "Thank you!" 
Later, the bunny wanted to save the rest of the carrot for later. He put it in the freezer to keep it fresh. But when he went back to get it, he couldn't find it! He looked and looked, but it was nowhere to be found. 
The bunny was sad because he didn't have any food to eat. But then, his friend came over and brought him some more carrots. The bunny was so happy and said, "Thank you!" again. From then on, the bunny knew he could always count on his friend to help him out when he was feeling poor.
