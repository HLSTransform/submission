Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She wanted to build a tower but she was scared. She kept looking up at the sky and felt a little overwhelmed.
Her mom came up to her and said, “Sarah, I know you are scared, but I will help you. I will encourage you.”
Sarah took a deep breath and nodded her head. She wanted to do it.
Her mom showed her how to stack one block on top of the other. She was careful and steady.
After they had built the tower, Sarah's mom encouraged her to take one more block and put it on top of the tower. Sarah reached up and put the block on top of the tower.
But the tower started to wobble and before they knew it, the tower was crashing down. The blocks were scattered everywhere.
Sarah looked up at her mom, her face clear with fear. Her mom smiled sadly and said, “That's okay Sarah, we can try again next time.”
