Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with clay. He would make all sorts of things like animals and cars. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy saw Timmy's clay creations and said, "Wow, Timmy! Your clay animals are so attractive!" 
Timmy smiled and said, "Thank you, Billy. Do you want to make something with me?" 
Billy nodded and they both started to make things with the clay. Suddenly, Timmy saw a bug crawling on the ground. "Look, Billy! A bug is crawling on the ground!" 
Billy looked and said, "Cool! Let's make a clay bug!" 
So they both made a clay bug and it turned out to be very attractive. They were both very happy and played with their clay creations all day long. The end.
