Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lynn. She was 3 years old and loved counting things. Every day she counted the butterflies in the garden, the stars in the sky, and the blocks she had to play with.
One day, Lynn was feeling troubled because she couldn't count anything special. She went to her mummy and said, "Mummy, I want to count something with more value. What can I count?"
Mummy smiled and said, "Lynn, the most valuable thing in the world is kindness. Kindness can't be counted like stars or blocks, but it's worth much more. Go and do something kind for someone today and it will have more value than anything else."
Lynn thought about it and then she knew what to do. She took a picnic basket to her neighbour's house and shared the sandwiches with him. He was so happy and thanked her. Lynn smiled and felt good inside because she knew she had done something valuable.
From then on, Lynn always shared her things with others and tried to do kind things. Because she knew that kindness was the most valuable thing of all.
