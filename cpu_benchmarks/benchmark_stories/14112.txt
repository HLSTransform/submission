Once upon a time there was a gifted turkey. All the other animals made fun of him and were mean to him. One day, the turkey wanted to get revenge on the other animals. So he hatched a plan to joke around them.
The turkey went up to the other animals and said, “Hey everyone, do you want to hear a funny joke?” The animals were so excited to hear a joke that they all stood still and said, “Yes!” 
The turkey said, “Knock knock! Who’s there? Turkey! Turkey who? Gifted turkey!”
The animals all laughed at the turkey’s joke. They were surprised that the turkey was so witty and funny. Every day after that, the turkey told the other animals a new joke. They were all very happy and never made fun of the turkey again.
The turkey was very pleased with himself and he never forgot his lesson - it’s good to make jokes, even if you’re a gifted turkey!
