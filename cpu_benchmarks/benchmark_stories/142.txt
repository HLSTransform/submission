Once upon a time, there was a little puppy named Spot. Spot loved to play and chase his tail. One day, Spot went for a walk with his owner, Sarah. Sarah let Spot off his leash so he could run and play. Spot was having so much fun that he didn't notice when Sarah started to leave.
"Spot, come on! We have to go home now," Sarah called.
Spot didn't want to leave yet, but he knew he had to go with Sarah. He wagged his tail happily and followed her home.
When they got home, Sarah gave Spot a treat. Spot was so grateful that he licked Sarah's face. "Thank you for the treat!" Spot barked happily.
Sarah smiled and scratched Spot's tail. "You're welcome, Spot. I'm grateful to have you as my puppy."
