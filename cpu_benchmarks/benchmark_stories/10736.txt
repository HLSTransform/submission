Once upon a time, there was a happy dog named Spot. Spot liked to jump and play in the park with his friends. One day, Spot saw a shiny collar on the ground. He picked it up and put it on. The collar was too tight, but Spot didn't mind.
Spot's owner didn't see the new collar and took him for a walk. Suddenly, Spot saw a squirrel and ran after it. He tried to jump over a fence, but the collar got stuck. Spot couldn't breathe and fell down. His owner tried to help him, but it was too late. Spot was dead.
Everyone was very sad. They buried Spot in the park and put flowers on his grave. His owner cried and wished he had never put the collar on Spot. From that day on, everyone remembered Spot as a happy dog who loved to jump and play.
