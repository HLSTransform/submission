Jill liked pink. She had a pink dress, a pink hat, and a pink doll. She took her pink doll everywhere. She talked to her pink doll and pretended it was her friend.
One day, Jill went to the park with her mom. She saw a fat boy playing with a truck. The fat boy saw Jill and her pink doll. He wanted the pink doll. He ran to Jill and grabbed the pink doll from her arms.
"Give me that!" he said. "I like pink too!"
Jill was sad and angry. She tried to get her pink doll back. She pulled and pushed the fat boy. She shouted, "No! It's mine! Go away!"
The fat boy was stronger and meaner. He pushed Jill to the ground. He laughed and ran away with the pink doll. Jill cried and cried. Her mom came and hugged her. She said, "I'm sorry, Jill. That was a bad boy. He should not take your pink doll."
Jill looked at the fat boy. He was far away. He threw the pink doll in the trash. He did not like pink. He just wanted to make Jill sad. Jill felt very sad. She wished she had her pink doll back. She wished the fat boy was nice. She wished the park was fun. But it was not. It was a bad day.
