Once upon a time, there was a big man with a mustache. He was very generous. He liked to give things to people. One day, he met a little girl. The little girl was sad.
"Why are you sad?" the big man asked the little girl.
"I want to weigh my toy, but I don't have a scale," the little girl said.
The generous man with the mustache wanted to help. He took the little girl to the store. They bought a scale together. The little girl was so happy.
Now, the little girl could weigh her toy. She thanked the generous man with the mustache. They became good friends. The little girl was not sad anymore.
