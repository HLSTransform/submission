Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and read books. One day, she was playing hide-and-seek with her friend, Timmy. She hid behind the enormous bookcase in the living room.
Timmy looked for her everywhere, but he couldn't find her. Finally, he saw her little feet sticking out from behind the bookcase. "I found you, Lily!" he shouted.
Lily giggled and said, "You did! But now it's my turn to find you." She crawled out from behind the bookcase and stood up. Suddenly, she kicked her toy car and it went flying across the room.
"Oops!" Lily said, "I didn't mean to do that. Let's go play something else." And off they went to play with their dolls.
