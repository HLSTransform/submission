Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Sue. She was very naughty.
One day, her mum wanted her to be quiet, but instead Sue was very noisy. Her mum was angry, so she decided to punish her.
So, Sue had to stand in a corner and be very still. She was very sad.
Then, her mum took out a big microphone and told her to say sorry. Sue said sorry very quietly. 
Her mum smiled and said that if she was good and quiet, she could play with a light toy she had seen earlier. Sue agreed, and she was very happy. 
From then on, Sue was a very good girl who listened to her mum.
