Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. But they do not like to take a nap. Mom says they need to nap every day, but they think it is boring.
One day, Mom tells them to go to their room and nap. Sara and Tom say no. They want to play more. Mom says they can play after they nap. She gives them a kiss and leaves.
Sara and Tom are not sleepy. They decide to sneak out of their room and go to the living room. They see a big vase with flowers on the table. They think it is pretty. They want to touch it.
Tom reaches for the vase, but he is clumsy. He knocks it over and it falls to the floor. It breaks into many pieces. The water and the flowers spill everywhere. Sara and Tom are scared. They hear Mom coming.
Mom sees the mess and is angry. She asks them what they did. Sara and Tom say they are sorry. They did not mean to break the vase. They just wanted to see it.
Mom says they should have listened to her and napped. She says they are in trouble. She makes them clean up the mess and go back to their room. She says they cannot play for the rest of the day.
Sara and Tom are sad. They wish they had napped. They realize that napping is not so bad. They hug each other and say they will nap tomorrow. They close their eyes and fall asleep.
