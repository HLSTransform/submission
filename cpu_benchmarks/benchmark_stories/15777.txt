Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Meg. She had a large bowl which she remembered always bringing along when she went out with her family.
One day, Meg was playing in the park with her mom and dad. Suddenly, she couldn't find her large bowl! She looked around and asked, "Mommy, where's my bowl?"
Her mom pointed at the ground and said, "I think it's over there, Meg. I remember seeing it right by the slide."
Meg ran to the slide and sure enough, she found her large bowl! She was so happy. She hugged the bowl and brought it back to her mom and dad.
From then on, Meg remembered to always bring her large bowl whenever she went out with her family.
