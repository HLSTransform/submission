One day, a boy named Tom went to the pond with his mom. He liked to look at the fish and the ducks and the bugs. He saw a frog sitting on a big leaf. He wanted to catch the frog and play with it.
"Mom, can I have the frog?" he asked.
"No, Tom, you can't have the frog. The frog is not a toy. The frog has a home and a family and he likes to be free. You have to be kind and humble and let the frog be," his mom said.
"But why, mom? I like the frog. He is green and he can jump and he can croak. He is fun," Tom said.
"Tom, you have to understand that the frog is not for you. He is a living thing and he has feelings and needs. He is not fun for you, he is scared and sad. He wants to stay in the pond and be with his friends. You have to respect the frog and leave him alone," his mom said.
Tom looked at the frog and he saw that the frog was not happy. He saw that the frog was shaking and hiding and trying to get away. He felt sorry for the frog and he realized that his mom was right. He did not want to hurt the frog or make him unhappy. He wanted to be a good and humble boy.
"OK, mom, I understand. I will not catch the frog. I will let him be. I will say sorry to the frog and I will wave goodbye," Tom said.
He went to the leaf and he said to the frog, "Sorry, frog, I did not mean to bother you. You are a nice frog and I hope you have a good day. Goodbye, frog." He waved his hand and he smiled.
The frog saw that Tom was kind and humble and he forgave him. He croaked and he waved his leg and he smiled too.
Tom and his mom walked away from the pond. They were happy and they learned something new. They understood that the frog was not a toy, but a friend.
