Once upon a time, a big hairy monster lived in the forest. He loved to run on the track and play with his friends. One day, he went for a run on the track and saw a little rabbit. The monster wanted to play with the rabbit, but the rabbit was scared and ran away.
The monster felt sad and wanted to make friends with the rabbit. So, he followed the rabbit and tried to talk to him. But the rabbit was still scared and started to scream. The monster didn't understand why the rabbit was screaming, so he backed away.
The monster felt sad that he couldn't make friends with the rabbit. He decided to go back to his friends and play with them instead. Even though he was sad, he knew that his friends loved him and he loved them too.
