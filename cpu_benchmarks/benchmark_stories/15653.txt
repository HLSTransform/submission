Jack was very eager to go to the market. He loved looking at all the vendors who had interesting things to sell. Today was especially exciting because Jack had saved his pennies and he was ready to buy something.
Finally, Jack reached the market. He watched as the vendors stirred up the crowd with their shouting. Then, Jack spotted a red toy he wanted. It was a shiny car and Jack was so excited!
He quickly grabbed his coins and rushed over to the vendor's stand. He pushed his coins towards the vendor, who smiled and handed him the toy. Jack thanked him, grabbed his toy and ran off to show his parents.
"Look what I bought, Mommy!" he said, showing her the shiny car, his eyes twinkling with joy.
His mother smiled. "That's wonderful, Jack. You did a great job saving your pennies."
Jack grinned, feeling proud of himself. He couldn't wait to show his new toy to all his friends.
