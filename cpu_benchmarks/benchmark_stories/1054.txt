Once upon a time there was a cupboard. It was big and brown and felt very happy. Then one day, something changed. Something bad happened to the cupboard. It became spoiled. 
The cupboard felt very sad. Nothing wanted to be near it because it looked so different now. Then one day, a little girl called Lily saw it. She smiled and said that she could make it better. 
Lily took out a brush and some paint. She painted the cupboard all the colours of the rainbow. She added some sparkles and made the cupboard look beautiful again. And when she finished, she opened the cupboard to find it full of special presents. 
The cupboard was so happy! It hugged Lily and thanked her for making it feel special. The cupboard and Lily became very good friends. And they lived happily ever after.
