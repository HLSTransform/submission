Once there was a mommy who loved to cook. Every day she cooked dinner for her family, but she always made one special dish - pepper!
The pepper was nice and dry, just the way her family liked it. The mommy always shared her pepper with her family and they all loved it!
When the family was finished eating, they would feel so full and happy. The mommy was very proud of how her pepper supported her family.
Every night, the family ate the mommy's pepper - until one day, there was no pepper left. The mommy was sad because she wanted to make sure her family was always supported with her special pepper dish!
The end.
