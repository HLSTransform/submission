Lily was nervous. She had to go to the dentist today. She did not like the dentist. He made loud noises and looked at her teeth with a big light. She wanted to stay home and play with her toys.
"Come on, Lily, it's time to go," her mom said. "Did you brush your teeth?"
Lily nodded. She had brushed her teeth very well. She hoped the dentist would be happy with her teeth. She grabbed her favorite teddy bear and followed her mom to the car.
At the dentist's office, Lily saw many other kids. Some of them were crying. Some of them were smiling. Lily did not know what to feel. She held her teddy bear tight.
"Lily, you're next," the nurse said. She led Lily and her mom to a room with a big chair and a lot of tools. Lily saw the dentist. He was wearing a mask and a hat. He smiled at Lily.
"Hello, Lily, I'm Dr. Lee. I'm going to check your teeth today. Don't worry, it won't hurt. You have a very nice teddy bear. What's his name?"
Lily looked at her teddy bear. She was scared. She did not want to talk to the dentist. She hid behind her mom.
"His name is Teddy," she replied in a small voice.
"That's a good name. Can I say hello to Teddy?" the dentist asked.
Lily nodded. She gave her teddy bear to the dentist. The dentist said hello to Teddy and gave him a sticker. He gave Teddy back to Lily.
"See, Teddy is not afraid of me. He likes me. Do you like me, Lily?" the dentist asked.
Lily looked at the dentist. He was nice. He gave Teddy a sticker. He did not make loud noises. She smiled.
"Yes, I like you," she replied.
"Good. Then let's see your teeth. Can you open your mouth for me?" the dentist asked.
Lily opened her mouth. The dentist looked at her teeth with a big light. He said her teeth were very clean and healthy. He praised her for brushing her teeth very well. He gave her a sticker too.
"Good job, Lily. You have beautiful teeth. You're a brave girl. You can go now. See you next time," the dentist said.
Lily was happy. She was not nervous anymore. She liked the dentist. She thanked him and said goodbye. She showed her mom and Teddy her sticker. She was proud of herself. She had gone to the dentist and it was not bad. She wanted to go home and play with her toys.
