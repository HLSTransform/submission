Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to walk around and explore his neighborhood. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the gym. The gym was a big building with lots of toys and games to play with. But Timmy thought it was dull because he couldn't run around and explore like he usually does. 
Timmy's mom suggested they go for a walk outside. Timmy was very happy because he loved to walk. They walked around the block and saw lots of interesting things like birds and flowers. Timmy was so happy that he forgot all about the dull gym. From that day on, Timmy and his mom would go for walks every day and have lots of fun exploring their neighborhood.
