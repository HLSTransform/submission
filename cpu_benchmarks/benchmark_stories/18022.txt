Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She went to the grocery store with her mommy. They were looking for yummy fruits and vegetables to eat. Lily saw a beautiful apple and she asked her mommy if they could buy it.
Mommy said, "Sure, let's record it on our grocery list." Lily didn't know what "record" meant, so she asked, "What does 'record' mean, mommy?" 
"It means we write it down so we don't forget to buy it," mommy explained. 
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, let's record it then!" They wrote down "apple" on their grocery list and continued shopping. 
After they finished shopping, they went to the cashier to pay. The cashier scanned all the items and said, "That will be $20, please." 
Lily handed the cashier the money and said, "Thank you for helping us record our groceries!" The cashier smiled and said, "You're welcome, have a nice day!"
