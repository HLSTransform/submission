Once upon a time there was a shy bunny. He hopped around in his garden, but no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't find a friend.
One day, it started to rain and the bunny was scared. He didn't like getting wet so he hopped into a nearby bush. Suddenly he heard a noise and quickly looked to see what it was. He saw a squirrel snapping a nut in two!
The bunny was so surprised and he became very brave. He slowly walked out from the bush, bit by bit, until the squirrel could see him. He said hello and asked if he wanted to become friends!
The squirrel said yes and they both ran out into the rain, and hopped and bounced around, giggling and laughing. From then on, the shy bunny had a great friend and every time it rained, they would go out and have lots of fun!
