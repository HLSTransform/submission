Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she went outside to play with her friend, Timmy. 
Timmy said, "Lily, look at the big clouds in the sky. They measure how much rain we will get." 
Lily looked up and saw the big, fluffy clouds. She said, "I hope it doesn't rain. I want to play outside all day." 
Timmy said, "Don't worry, Lily. The weather is quiet today. That means it will be sunny and warm all day." 
Lily smiled and they played together all day. They measured how high they could jump and how fast they could run. They had so much fun in the quiet, sunny weather.
