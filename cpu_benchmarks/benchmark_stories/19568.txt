Once there was a mom. She was worried. She wanted to help her 3-year-old son learn to act nice and be polite to others. One day, she had a great idea. She took her son to the post office. 
At the post office, her son saw lots of cool things. He really wanted to take them home. His mom said, "No thank you," but he was sad. 
Mom said, "I can give you something else if you accept it." She got a special postcard for him. It had a picture of a clown on it. Her son was really excited! He said, "Yes, I accept it!" 
So, his mom was very happy. She said, "That was such good behavior. Now we can go home." 
This was an important lesson. He had to learn to accept things he couldn't have. His mom was no longer worried.
