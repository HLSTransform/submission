Tommy and Lily were best friends. They liked to play with their toys, draw pictures and sing songs. One day, Tommy's mom said they could go to the park. Tommy was very happy. He wanted to introduce Lily to his other friends.
At the park, Tommy saw Danny, Sam and Mia. They were playing with a ball. Tommy ran to them and said, "Hi, friends! This is Lily. She is my best friend. Can she play with us?" Danny, Sam and Mia looked at Lily. They did not like her. They thought she was too small and too quiet.
"No, she can't," Danny said. "She is not our friend. She is boring. Go away, Tommy. We don't want to play with you and Lily." Tommy felt sad and angry. He did not understand why they were so mean. He said, "But Lily is nice and fun. She can share and help. Why are you so mean?"
"Because we can," Sam said. He kicked the ball hard. The ball hit Lily in the face. Lily cried. She felt hurt and scared. Tommy hugged her and said, "Don't cry, Lily. I'm sorry. They are bad. Let's go to another place."
But it was too late. The ball had broken Lily's glasses. She could not see well without them. She tripped over a rock and fell down. She scraped her knee and elbow. She cried louder. Tommy tried to help her, but he did not know what to do. He felt sorry and scared too.
Tommy's mom heard the cries. She ran to them and saw what happened. She was very angry. She said, "What did you do, Tommy? How could you let this happen? You are in big trouble, young man. You have to apologize to Lily and her mom. And you have to pay for the glasses. You are not going to the park for a long time."
Tommy felt ashamed and sad. He said, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, Lily. I just wanted to introduce you to my friends. I didn't know they would be so mean and hurt you. Please forgive me."
Lily was very grateful to Tommy. She knew he was not mean. He was her best friend. She said, "It's okay, Tommy. I forgive you. You are not in trouble with me. You tried to help me. Thank you. But I don't want to play with your other friends. They are not nice. They are mean. I only want to play with you."
Tommy and Lily hugged. They felt better. But they still had to face their moms. They knew they would be in trouble for a long time. They wished they had never gone to the park. They wished they had stayed home and played with their toys, drawn pictures and sung songs. They learned a hard lesson. They learned that some people are not nice. They learned that introducing someone can be dangerous. They learned that being best friends is not always easy.
