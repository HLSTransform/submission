Once upon a time, there was an adventurous thief. He was always looking for a way to get some valuable items quickly.One day, he came across a strange machine in the forest. He was curious and decided to check it out.
The thief touched the machine and it started to hum. The thief started to shrink! The thief looked at the machine and realized that it was a special shrinking machine and that he had been fooled. He kept trying to get back to his regular size, but nothing worked.
The thief began to feel desperate and hopeless. Sadly, he spent the rest of his days in the forest, too small to be of any real use to anyone. 
The thief had been too adventurous and now he was trapped forever. A warning to all greedy people who are tempted by fortune and glory â€“ be careful of what you try to take!
