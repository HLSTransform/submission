Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her delicate dolls. One day, Lily wanted to see how much her doll weighed, so she put it on a scale. The scale showed that her doll was very light, just like a feather!
Lily then went outside to play on the swings. She sat on one side of the swing and her friend sat on the other side. They took turns pushing each other higher and higher. Lily loved the feeling of the wind blowing in her hair as she swung back and forth.
After a while, Lily got thirsty and went to get a drink of water. She noticed that her glass was heavier than her doll, but lighter than her backpack. Lily thought it was fun to weigh different things and see which side was heavier. She couldn't wait to weigh more things and learn more about them.
