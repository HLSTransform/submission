Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sara. She was an adventurous girl who liked to do silly things. 
One day, she went to the theater with her mum. She had so much fun looking at all the things inside the theater. 
But then, something funny happened. When people started to watch the movie, Sara had an idea. She wanted to surprise the other people in the theater, so she sprayed the theater with silly string. 
The other people were really surprised. But then, they were angry and embarrassed. Sara felt really bad. 
Luckily, the movie was almost over. Everyone calmed down and enjoyed the rest of the movie. Sara apologised and promised not to do anything silly again. The people were happy and forgave Sara.
