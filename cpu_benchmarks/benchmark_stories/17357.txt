Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They found a big skull under a bush. It was white and hard and had many teeth.
"Wow, look at this!" Ben said. "It is a skull. Maybe it was a dinosaur or a dragon."
Lily was scared. She did not like the skull. She wanted to play with something else.
"Ben, I don't like the skull. It is ugly and scary. Can we play with the flowers instead?" she asked.
Ben had an idea. He wanted to make the skull more fun and pretty.
"No, Lily, the skull is cool. We can decorate it with the flowers. Then it will look like a fairy or a princess," he said.
He picked some red flowers and put them on the skull. He made a crown and a necklace and a bracelet. He gave the skull a smile with a red flower.
"See, Lily, now the skull is red and beautiful. It is not scary anymore. It is our friend," he said.
Lily looked at the skull. She saw the red flowers and the smile. She thought the skull was still a little scary, but also a little funny.
"Okay, Ben, the skull is red and beautiful. It is our friend. But can we also play with the ball and the bike?" she said.
Ben nodded. He took the skull and put it on the bike. He gave it a red flower to hold.
"Sure, Lily, we can play with the ball and the bike. And the skull can come with us. It will have fun too," he said.
They rode the bike and kicked the ball. They laughed and played. The skull was red and beautiful. It was their friend.
