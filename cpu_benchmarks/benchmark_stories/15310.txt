Once upon a time there were two ducks, Red and Blue. Red and Blue were good friends. But one day, they got into a quarrel. Blue thought Red was being too loud and Red thought Blue was too grumpy.
The two ducks quacked loudly at each other so the farmer came over to them. He gave Red and Blue a harmless bucket. "Use this to cool off," he said. Red and Blue stopped their quarrel and sat down by the bucket. 
They realized that cool water was running into the bucket from a nearby hose. The cool water made them both feel better. Red put his beak in and Blue put his feet in and they both enjoyed the water. 
Seeing Red and Blue happily sipping from the bucket together made the farmer very happy. Red and Blue still quarrel every now and then, but the bucket always helps them to remember the good things about being friends.
