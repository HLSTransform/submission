Once upon a time, there was an image. It was hidden in a dark corner so nobody could see it. But it was still there!
One day, a little boy found the image. He knew it was hidden so he was very excited. He wanted to take the image outside to show his friends.
But when he tried to pick up the image, it fell apart. It was old and had rotted away. The little boy was very sad. He wanted to show the image to his friends, but it was gone.
He tried to remember the image in his head. He thought he could tell his friends what the image looked like. He knew he would never forget the hidden image.
