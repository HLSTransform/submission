Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play together. One day, Tom wants to visit Mia at her house. He walks to her door and rings the bell.
Ding dong! The bell makes a loud sound. Mia hears the bell and runs to the door. She opens it and sees Tom.
"Hi, Tom!" Mia says. "Do you want to play with me?"
"Yes, please!" Tom says. "What do you want to play?"
Mia thinks for a moment. She has a clever idea. She says, "Let's play hide and seek! I will hide and you will seek. Count to ten and then look for me."
"OK!" Tom says. He covers his eyes and starts to count. "One, two, three..."
Mia runs to find a good hiding place. She sees a big box in the living room. She climbs inside the box and closes the lid. She thinks Tom will not find her there.
Tom finishes counting. "Ten! Ready or not, here I come!" He says. He looks around the house. He checks under the bed, behind the sofa, in the closet. He cannot find Mia.
"Where are you, Mia?" He calls. "I give up!"
Mia hears Tom. She smiles. She thinks she is very clever. She decides to surprise Tom. She opens the lid of the box and jumps out.
"Boo!" She shouts. "Here I am!"
Tom is startled. He sees Mia in the box. He laughs. He says, "You are very clever, Mia! You found a good hiding place. You win!"
Mia laughs too. She says, "Thank you, Tom! You are a good seeker. You looked everywhere. You are fun!"
Tom and Mia hug. They are happy. They are good friends. They decide to play another game. They have a lot of fun. They like to visit each other.
