Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Jill. They were playing in a park when suddenly they felt the ground shake. It was an earthquake - a big shake in the ground!
Jack and Jill were both very scared. They held each other tightly and looked around for help. Then suddenly a furry animal came out from the bushes and sprayed water from his mouth. It was a magical creature - he could spray water from his mouth and make things better!
Jack and Jill smiled and clapped. The furry animal sprayed more water and the shaking stopped. The ground was still again and the park was quiet. Jack and Jill thanked the furry creature. He smiled and then disappeared into the bushes.
The End.
