Once upon a time there was a factory. It was a big place full of people working with lots of noise and lights. Everyone was happy and feeling safe until one day, something unexpected happened. The factory had to close!
The people working there were disappointed and sad. They all got together to talk about what had happened. Luckily, there was a kind man who was very compassionate. He had a plan to make sure everyone was taken care of.
The kind man had enough money to help the people who used to work in the factory. He made sure they had food, shelter and places to sleep. He was so compassionate and caring that everyone was truly grateful.
In the end, the factory was closed but the people were okay. Even though it was not the outcome they wanted, they were glad for the kind and compassionate man who made sure they were taken care of.
