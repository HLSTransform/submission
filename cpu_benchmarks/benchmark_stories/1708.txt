Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily was playing in the park. She was having so much fun on the swings and the slide. Suddenly, she saw a man with a big box. 
"Hello little girl, would you like to create something with me?" the man asked.
"Yes please!" Lily replied excitedly.
The man opened the box and took out some paper and paint. Together they started to create a beautiful fair angel. Lily was so happy with their creation and said, "Thank you for helping me make this pretty angel. I will keep it forever!" 
The man smiled and said, "It was my pleasure. Remember, you can create anything you want with your imagination." 
Lily thanked the man and ran home with her new fair angel. She couldn't wait to show her mom and dad what she had made. From that day on, Lily loved to create things and use her imagination to make the world a more beautiful place.
