Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and look up at the ceiling. One day, Lily's mom asked her to clean up her toys, but Lily didn't want to. She thought it was too much work.
Lily's mom was thoughtful and knew that Lily loved to look at the ceiling. So, she made a request to Lily. "If you clean up your toys, we can lay on the floor and look up at the ceiling together," she said.
Lily thought about it for a moment and realized that it would be fun to look up at the ceiling with her mom. So, she cleaned up her toys and they both laid on the floor, looking up at the ceiling. Lily felt happy that she listened to her mom and learned that cleaning up can lead to fun things. The moral of the story is that it's important to listen to our parents and do what they ask us to do.
