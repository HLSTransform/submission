One day, a little girl named Mary went outside to play. She discovered a waffle lying on the ground. It looked light and golden, like butter melted and sparkled in the sun.
Mary was so excited. She picked up the waffle and ran inside to show her family.
She said, "Look what I found!" Her parents and brother were surprised. "Where did you find it?" they asked.
Mary said, "I found it outside. It was light and golden, like butter melted and sparkled in the sun."
They all smiled and took a bite. It was so delicious! They were so happy that Mary had discovered the yummy waffle.
