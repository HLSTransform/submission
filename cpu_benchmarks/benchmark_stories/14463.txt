One morning, a little boy went to collect things. His mom was dark. He was so happy. 
He looked around and saw lots of things to collect. He found some small rocks, a pretty flower, and a piece of paper with a drawing of a big smiley face. He was so excited! 
He put all of his things in his pockets. His mom smiled when she saw what he had collected. 
He ran off in the dark morning with all his new things and had fun all day.
The little boy was so excited to go collecting again the next morning.
