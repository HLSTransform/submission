One day, a blue bird was flying in the sky. The bird had a wish. The wish was to find a big, yummy worm to eat. The bird saw a worm on the ground and went to get it.
But, a big cat saw the worm too. The cat wanted to eat the worm as well. The bird and the cat did not want to share. They both tried to resist giving the worm to the other one.
In the end, the worm got away. The bird and the cat were both sad. They did not get to eat the worm. The bird and the cat learned that they should share next time.
