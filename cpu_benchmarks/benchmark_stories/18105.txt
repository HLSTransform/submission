Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Nemo. Nemo lived in a big ocean with his friends. One day, Nemo had an idea to play a game. He wanted to see who could dive the deepest. 
Nemo asked his friend, Sammy, "Do you want to play a game with me? We can dive really deep and see who can go the farthest." 
Sammy replied, "That's a great idea, Nemo! But is it safe to dive so deep?" 
Nemo thought about it for a moment and said, "Yes, it's safe. We just have to be careful and not go too deep." 
So, Nemo and Sammy started to dive down into the ocean. They went deeper and deeper until they couldn't see anything. But they were having so much fun! They were safe and having a great time playing their game.
