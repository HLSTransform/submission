Once upon a time, there was a bald man. He had a pet lizard that he loved very much. Every day, he would feed the lizard vegetables and fruits.
One day, when the man went to feed his pet, he saw that the lizard had already eaten all the food.
The man said to the lizard, "Why did you eat all the food I left for you?"
The lizard said in its small voice, "I was so hungry and I didn't know when you would come home so I ate it all."
The man was surprised by the lizard's honesty and said, "It is important that we are honest to others and share food with them".
From that day, the man always remembered to be honest and also to share his food with others.
