Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved spicy food and her mom would always cook her favorite spicy noodles. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She saw a beautiful butterfly and tried to catch it. But, she tripped and fell on the ground. Her knee was hurt and she started to cry.
Her friend, Tommy, came running to her and asked, "What happened, Lily?" Lily said, "I fell down and it hurts." Tommy said, "Don't worry, I will help you." He ran to his house and asked his mom for a wire. He came back with the wire and tied it around Lily's knee. Lily said, "Thank you, Tommy. You are so kind." 
The next day, Lily received a surprise gift from Tommy. It was a spicy sauce bottle with a note that said, "Get well soon, Lily. This is my favorite spicy sauce. I hope you like it too." Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, Tommy. You are the best friend ever."
