Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved watching television. He would sit on the couch and watch his favorite shows all day long. One day, Timmy's mom told him that a famous singer was going to be on TV.
Timmy didn't mind watching the famous singer on TV, but he wanted to watch his own shows too. So, he made a plan. He decided to watch the famous singer for a little while, and then he would switch back to his favorite shows.
When the famous singer came on TV, Timmy was excited. He watched the singer sing and dance, and he thought it was really cool. But after a while, he got bored and wanted to watch his own shows again. So, he turned off the TV and went outside to play.
