Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on journeys with her mommy and daddy. One day, they decided to go on a journey to a big green forest. 
As they walked through the forest, Lily looked around and saw many trees and animals. She saw a big brown bear and a little green frog. 
"Look, mommy! A frog!" Lily said.
"Yes, Lily. It's a little green frog," her mommy replied.
After a while, they came to a beautiful waterfall. Lily loved the sound of the water falling down. 
"This journey is so much fun!" Lily said.
"I'm glad you're having a good time, sweetie," her daddy said. 
After a long day of walking, they went back home. Lily was tired but happy from her journey in the green forest.
