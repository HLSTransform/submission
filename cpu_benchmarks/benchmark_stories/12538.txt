Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite toy, a teddy bear. One day, she lost her teddy bear and couldn't find it anywhere. She asked her mommy and daddy if they knew where it was, but they didn't know. 
Lily was very sad and went to her room. She looked under her bed and in her closet, but her teddy bear was nowhere to be found. She felt empty without her teddy bear. 
Suddenly, she heard a voice coming from her toy box. "I know where your teddy bear is," said the voice. It was her toy clown. "Where is he?" asked Lily. "He's in the closet," said the clown. 
Lily ran to the closet and found her teddy bear. She was so happy and hugged him tightly. But then, the closet door closed on her and she couldn't get out. She was stuck inside and no one knew where she was. It was true that the clown knew where her teddy bear was, but it was also true that the closet was a dangerous place to play.
