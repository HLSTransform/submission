Once upon a time, there lived two friends, Tim and Jeff. They both loved learning and wanted to go to university one day.
One day, they decided to have a big adventure. They wanted to discover something new. So they set off on their journey.
They walked for a long time until finally they reached a beautiful university in the countryside. Tim and Jeff were amazed! They had never seen a university before.
When they got to the university, the students and teachers there were very generous. They let the two friends see inside the university and showed them all around. Jeff and Tim were so excited to learn new things.
It was a very special day for their adventure. As they continued their journey, Jeff said to Tim, “It’s ok to be curious and explore the world. But we must remember to always be kind and generous to others”.
Tim nodded and both of them smiled, remembering their amazing day of discovery.
