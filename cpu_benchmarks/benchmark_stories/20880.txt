Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was very lonely. She wished she had someone to play with.
Everyday she would complain to her uncle out loud, hoping he could make her wishes come true.
 
One day her uncle had an idea. He went to the store and bought some toys. He also bought a puppy so she would have a friend.
The girl was so excited. She took the puppy for a walk and played with the toys. Now she had someone to play with and was no longer lonely.
Everyday the little girl would go outside with her puppy, play with her toys and be happy. No more complaining for her, just fun and play!
