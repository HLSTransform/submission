Lily was a girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Anna. Anna had long hair, a pink dress and a shiny crown. Lily always took Anna with her wherever she went.
One day, Lily went to school with Anna. She wanted to show her doll to her friends. She put Anna in her backpack and waited for the bus. When she got to school, she ran to her room. She saw her teacher, Miss Lee, and said hello.
"Hello, Lily. What do you have in your backpack?" Miss Lee asked.
Lily smiled and opened her backpack. She took out Anna and held her up.
"This is Anna. She is my best friend. She is very pretty and smart. Do you like her?" Lily said.
Miss Lee looked at Anna and nodded. She said, "Yes, she is very pretty and smart. But Lily, you know that today is a special day, right?"
Lily frowned. She did not know what Miss Lee meant. She said, "What special day?"
Miss Lee said, "Today is picture day. We are going to take a picture of our room. Everyone has to wear their ordinary clothes. No costumes, no hats, no crowns. Do you have your ordinary clothes, Lily?"
Lily felt her face get hot. She realized that she had forgotten to change her clothes. She was still wearing her princess dress and tiara that she had put on at home. She looked around and saw that everyone else was wearing their ordinary clothes. She felt very embarrass. She said, "No, I don't have my ordinary clothes. I only have this dress and this tiara. And Anna."
Miss Lee saw that Lily was embarrass. She said, "Don't worry, Lily. It's okay. You can borrow some ordinary clothes from me. And you can keep Anna with you. She can be in the picture too. Come on, let's go to the closet and find something for you to wear."
Lily nodded and followed Miss Lee. She was glad that Miss Lee was nice and did not get mad at her. She hoped that her friends would not laugh at her. She hugged Anna and whispered, "It's okay, Anna. We are still princesses. We just have to wear ordinary clothes for a little while."
