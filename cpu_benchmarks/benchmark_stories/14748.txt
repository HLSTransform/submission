Tom and Lily like to eat yogurt. They have a big bowl of yogurt with fruit and honey. They eat with spoons and make happy sounds.
But one day, a fierce dog comes to their house. The dog is big and black and has sharp teeth. He barks and growls and jumps on the fence. Tom and Lily are scared. They drop their spoons and run inside.
The dog sees the yogurt. He likes yogurt too. He jumps over the fence and runs to the bowl. He licks the yogurt with his tongue and makes messy sounds.
Tom and Lily peek from the window. They see the dog eating their yogurt. They are sad and angry. They want their yogurt back. They think of a plan.
They find a big stick and a loud horn. They go outside and sneak behind the dog. They shout and wave the stick and blow the horn. The dog is surprised and scared. He drops the bowl and runs away.
Tom and Lily pick up the bowl. The yogurt is still there. They are happy and brave. They eat the yogurt with spoons and make happy sounds. They share with their cat, who likes yogurt too. The end.
