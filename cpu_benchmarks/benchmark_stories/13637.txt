Sara and Ben are young twins who like to play together. One day, they decide to have fun in the bathtub. They fill it with warm water and lots of bubbles. They bring their rubber ducks and boats and splash each other.
"Look, Sara, I can slide on the soap!" Ben says, as he slides from one end of the tub to the other. He laughs and makes a big wave.
"Wow, Ben, that looks fun! Can I try?" Sara asks, as she grabs the soap. She slides too, but she slides too fast and bumps into the faucet. She cries and holds her head.
"Ouch, Sara, are you okay?" Ben asks, as he stops sliding and goes to hug her. He sees a little blood on her forehead. He gets scared and calls for Mom.
"Mom, Mom, help! Sara is hurt!" Ben yells, as he wraps a towel around Sara's head.
Mom hears Ben and runs to the bathroom. She sees Sara and Ben in the bathtub, wet and scared. She takes Sara in her arms and kisses her.
"Don't worry, Sara, it's just a small cut. You'll be fine. Let me clean it and put a band-aid on it. And you, Ben, you're a good brother for helping her. But no more sliding in the bathtub, okay? It's too dangerous. You can play with the bubbles and the toys instead." Mom says, as she dries them and dresses them.
Sara and Ben nod and hug Mom. They say sorry for making a mess and promise to be careful. They still love the bathtub, but they don't slide anymore. They play with the bubbles and the toys and have fun. They are happy and safe.
