Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to travel to new places with her family. One day, they went to a farm to pick some apples. Lily found a rare apple that was very pretty and shiny. 
She showed it to her dad and said, "Look, Daddy! I found a rare apple!" Her dad smiled and said, "Wow, that's amazing! Let's pick it and take it home with us." 
On the way home, Lily asked her mom, "Can we make a pie with the rare apple?" Her mom replied, "Of course, we can! It will be delicious." Lily was so happy and couldn't wait to get home and make the apple pie. 
When they got home, they made the pie together and it was the best pie they had ever tasted. Lily was so proud of herself for finding the rare apple and making the yummy pie with her family.
