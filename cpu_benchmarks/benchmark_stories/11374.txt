Once upon a time there was a happy blue bird. She wanted to take a walk in the bright sunshine. She flew out of her nest and saw a little girl. The girl said, "Good morning blue bird! Can I take you for a walk?" The blue bird said, "Yes, I would love to go."
The little girl and the blue bird began to walk. They laughed and had fun. They danced and sang. Soon they came to a park.
Suddenly there was a loud noise. The little girl and the blue bird were scared. A big bull came running towards them. The blue bird was scared so she flew away. The little girl started to cry.
Suddenly the big bull stopped. He said to the little girl, "Don't be scared, it's always better to be brave." The little girl was happy because she had learned something new.
The girl and the blue bird stayed friends. The moral of this story is that it's always important to have courage even when things are scary.
