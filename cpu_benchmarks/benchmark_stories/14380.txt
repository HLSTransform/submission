Once upon a time, there was a small octopus who wanted to perform in a big show. He asked his friends, "Can I perform with you?" But they said, "No, you're too small." The small octopus felt sad.
One day, a big storm came and all of the other octopuses got hurt. The small octopus saw his chance to help. He performed a special dance that he had been practicing all by himself. The other octopuses were amazed and cheered for him.
After the storm, the other octopuses apologized for not letting the small octopus perform with them. They learned that everyone, no matter how small, has something special to offer. The small octopus felt happy and proud that he was able to help his friends.
