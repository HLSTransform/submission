Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs. Ben had a small shovel and Lily had a big spoon.
"Look, Lily, I found a worm!" Ben said, holding up a long, slimy thing.
"Wow, Ben, that's a big worm!" Lily said, leaning closer. "Can I touch it?"
"Okay, but be gentle," Ben said, handing her the worm. Lily touched it softly and felt it wriggle in her hand.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was their mom, calling them from the house.
"Ben, Lily, come inside! It's time for lunch!" she shouted.
Ben and Lily dropped the worm and ran to the house. They were hungry and glad to eat. They entered the kitchen and saw a big plate of sandwiches on the table.
"Yummy, sandwiches!" Ben said, grabbing one.
"Thank you, mom!" Lily said, taking another.
They sat down and started to eat. They saw the worm crawling on the window sill, looking for a way out.
"Bye, worm!" Ben said, waving.
"See you later, worm!" Lily said, smiling.
They ate their sandwiches and drank their juice. They were happy and full. They liked to play in the garden, but they also liked to enter the house and eat lunch.
