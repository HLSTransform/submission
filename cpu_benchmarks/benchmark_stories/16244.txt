Once there was a little girl named Lisa. She was independent and always wanted to do things on her own. She went to the park with her mom, carrying her favourite toy - a stuffed elephant. As she ran around the park, she spotted something that made her stop in her tracks. It was a little girl, sitting on a bench and wearing bright makeup. She was fascinated. 
'Mommy, can I wear makeup too?' asked Lisa, looking up at her mom.
'Not now,' answered her mommy. 'Maybe when you are a little bit older than you are now.' 
Lisa was disappointed but she kept her elephant close to her chest and kept playing. 
Years later, Lisa found herself back in the same park with her own daughter. This time, her daughter was wearing makeup and Lisa smiled knowingly to herself. She now understood why her mom had said 'not now' all those years ago. She needed to be a little bit older and more independent before she could try out makeup. 
'Come on, sweetie. Let's go home,' said Lisa to her daughter. As they walked away, Lisa was filled with pride at how much her daughter had grown up. Little did she know that it was the same park she had been to as a child - the place that had sparked her interest in makeup.
