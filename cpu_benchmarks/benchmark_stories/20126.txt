Lily was a little girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a big doll, a red car, a yellow ball and a blue bear. She loved her toys very much and took good care of them. She always put them away in her box when she was done playing.
One day, Lily was playing with her toys in her room. She heard a loud noise outside. She ran to the window and saw a big truck. The truck was very dirty and noisy. It had a big shovel on the front. Lily was curious and scared. She wondered what the truck was doing.
She saw the truck move closer to her house. She saw the shovel lift up and hit the wall. She heard a crash and saw bricks fall down. She screamed and ran to the door. She wanted to find her mom and dad. But the door was stuck. She could not open it. She was trapped in her room.
She looked around and saw her toys. They were scattered on the floor. Some of them were broken. She saw her big doll with a missing arm. She saw her red car with a smashed wheel. She saw her yellow ball with a hole. She saw her blue bear with a ripped ear. She felt sad and angry. She wanted her toys back. She wanted to get out of her room.
She heard another loud noise. She saw the shovel hit the wall again. She saw a big hole appear in the wall. She saw the truck driver's face. He had a big nose and a mean smile. He saw Lily and laughed. He said, "Hello, little girl. Do you want to play with me?" He reached his hand through the hole and grabbed Lily's hair. He pulled her towards the hole. Lily felt pain and fear. She tried to scream and kick. But she was helpless. She could not stop him. He took her out of her room and threw her in the back of his truck. He drove away with her. Lily never saw her mom and dad or her toys again.
