Molly was a funny girl. She was three years old and loved to play with her friends. One day, she wanted to make her meal special, so she asked her mom for some sauce. Her mom said yes, and Molly was really happy. 
But when Molly put the sauce on her food, it was way too spicy for her to eat. She tried to resist the heat, but it was too strong. She knew that the sauce was stupid and she should have asked her mom for something else. 
Molly went back to her mom and asked for something milder. Her mom smiled and gave her a jar of mild sauce this time. Molly was so relieved, and she put the mild sauce on her food. It was just what she needed and she was able to enjoy her meal. 
Molly was happy that she resisted the heat of the spicy sauce. From that day, she would always look for milder options when it came to her meals.
