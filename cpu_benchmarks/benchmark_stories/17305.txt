Once upon a time, there was a little ant. The ant was walking in the park when it met a little girl. The little girl looked at the ant and said, "Hello little ant, you are so tiny!" 
The ant looked up at the little girl and said, "Yes, I am small but I am very strong." 
The little girl was so excited to see the ant. She wanted to play with it, but the ant was too busy. The ant had to find food for its family. 
The little girl felt sorry for the ant. She said, "Oh poor ant, you must be very busy. I will let you go now." 
The ant smiled and said, "Thank you, little girl. I must go now. Goodbye!" And with that, the ant went on its way, feeling happy to have met the little girl.
