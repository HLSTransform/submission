Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to explore the world. One day, he decided he wanted to fly in an airplane. His mom and dad said it was a good idea, so they suggested he go with them.
The family was excited to travel to different places, but the weather wasn't great. It was very windy and looked dangerous.
The boy thought of an idea, he suggested they all go up in the airplane and fly over it. His mom and dad said it seemed too dangerous, so they said no. The boy didn't listen and decided to go up in the airplane anyway. 
Unfortunately, the winds were too strong, and the airplane was swept up higher and higher into the sky. The family was scared and called for help. Sadly, the police and fire department weren't able to save the boy. 
The terrible storm made it hard to fly safely and the boy's plane crashed. The family was heartbroken. The boy never came back and they never got to explore the world together.
