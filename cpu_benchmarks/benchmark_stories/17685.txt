Once there was a man who was walking down a hot street. He felt thirsty and decided to find a stream. After walking a bit further he finally saw a stream. It sparkled in the hot sunshine and looked like it was full of crystal clear water. 
The man was very happy and got ready to drink some of the cool water. But then he heard a growling noise behind him. When he looked back he saw a big, scary dog. 
The man was scared and he didn't know what to do. He had never seen this dog before. Then he thought to himself, "I need to trust that the dog is friendly". So he took a step closer and the dog wagged its tail. 
The man was very relieved. He bent down and started to drink the cool, refreshing water from the stream. The man and the dog became friends and drank the water together. 
The man was very grateful to the dog for trusting him and giving him a chance. And the dog was happy to show the man that it was friendly.
