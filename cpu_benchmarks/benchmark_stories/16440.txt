Anna and Ben are twins. They like to go to the big mall with Mom. The mall has many shops and toys and people. The twins enjoy looking at everything.
But their favorite thing is the elevator. The elevator is a big box that moves up and down. It has buttons and lights and a door that opens and closes. The twins like to press the buttons and watch the lights. They like to feel the elevator go up and down.
One day, they go to the mall with Mom. They see the elevator and run to it. Mom follows them. They press the button and wait for the door to open.
"Can we go to the top floor, Mom?" Anna asks.
"Sure, sweetie. Let's go to the top floor and see the view," Mom says.
They get in the elevator and press the button for the top floor. The door closes and the elevator starts to move. The twins watch the lights change and count the floors.
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!" Ben says.
The elevator stops and the door opens. They see a big window that shows the whole city. The city is light and bright and colorful. The twins are amazed.
"Wow, look at that, Anna!" Ben says.
"Wow, look at that, Ben!" Anna says.
They run to the window and point at the buildings and cars and trees. Mom smiles and joins them. They enjoy the view and the elevator. They are happy.
