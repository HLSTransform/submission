Once upon a time, there was a mighty dog named Max. Max loved to play ball on the pitch near his home. One sunny day, Max saw a little girl named Lucy. Lucy was sad because she lost her ball.
Max wanted to help Lucy. He said, "Don't worry, I will find your ball!" Max ran all around the pitch, looking for the ball. He looked under the trees and behind the bushes. Finally, he found the ball near a big rock.
Max brought the ball back to Lucy. She was so happy! She said, "Thank you, Max! You are a mighty helper!" They played ball together until the sun began to set. As the day came to an end, Max and Lucy walked home, knowing they had made a new friend.
