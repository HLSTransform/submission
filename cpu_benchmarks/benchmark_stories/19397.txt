Once upon a time, Ali asked her mommy if she could go play with her friends. Her mom said yes, but told Ali to invite them over to their house. Ali was so excited and ran over to her friends' house.
When she got there, all of her friends were so happy to see her. She invited them to her house for a play date. They happily said yes!
At the house, everyone played fun games together and laughed a lot. After the games, Ali gave everyone big hugs. The hugs were so warm and so hard. 
The day was such a success. Everyone agreed that it was the best play date ever. Ali and her friends agreed to have another play date soon.
