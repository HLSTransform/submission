Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was feeling very sad.
The little girl saw a jug and decided to take it with her and rest. She wanted to sit in the sun and find some peace.
While the little girl was resting, a big and scary dog appeared nearby. She was very scared and quickly jumped up and ran away.
When she stopped to catch her breath, she noticed that she had dropped the jug in her hurry. She felt very ashamed.
Suddenly, a kind voice said, "It's ok little one. Don't feel ashamed".
The little girl looked up to find a kind old man standing nearby. He said, "I can help you find your jug".
The little girl smiled and said, "Thank you". Together they searched until they found it.
The little girl was very happy and she thanked the old man. She then went on her way feeling much better.
