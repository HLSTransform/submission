Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in their house. One day, they find a smelly sock under the stair. Sara picks it up and says, "Look, Ben, a smelly sock! Who left it here?"
Ben wrinkles his nose and says, "Ew, Sara, put it down! It is yucky! Maybe it is Dad's sock. He always forgets his socks."
Sara laughs and says, "No, Ben, it is not Dad's sock. It is too small. Maybe it is Tim's sock. He is our baby brother. He likes to throw his socks everywhere."
Ben nods and says, "You are right, Sara. It is Tim's sock. Let's go and give it to him. He might miss it."
Sara and Ben run to Tim's room. They see Tim sleeping in his crib. He has a teddy bear in his arms. Sara and Ben are quiet. They do not want to wake him up. They care about him. He is their baby brother.
Sara puts the smelly sock next to Tim's crib. She says, "Here, Tim, your sock. We found it under the stair. We hope you like it."
Ben says, "Yes, Tim, your sock. It is very smelly. But we love you anyway."
Sara and Ben smile and tiptoe out of the room. They go back to play in their house. They are happy. They are twins.
