Once there was a little girl. She had something in her mouth and she was chewing it. It was a yummy reward. It was very different in taste than anything she had ever eaten before. She liked the way it felt in her mouth as she chewed it. 
The little girl was so happy that she smiled and clapped her hands together. She decided to share her reward with her family. She gave some to her brothers and sisters. They all loved it! They were so happy with their reward that they rewarded the little girl with big hugs and kisses. 
The little girl was so excited that she ran around her house twice. She had been given the best reward ever for being such a good girl - delicious, different food!
