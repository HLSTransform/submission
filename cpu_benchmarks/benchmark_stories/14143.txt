Once there was a small girl named Mary. Mary was very happy and liked to play.
One day, Mary decided to go for a walk. She skipped and sang all the way. Suddenly, Mary heard someone calling her name. She looked around and saw a friendly bird.
'Hello, Mary!' called the bird.
Mary smiled and waved. 'Hello!', she called back happily.
The bird asked if Mary wanted to play a game. Mary was excited, and said yes!
The bird and Mary started the game. They had to look for something small. Mary looked around and found a shiny penny.
The bird nodded. 'You won!', it said. Mary was so happy to have won. She thanked the bird and then skipped away, holding the penny tightly in her hand.
