Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who loved each other very much. They wanted to get married, so they decided to find a color. They looked everywhere, but they couldn't find the right color.
One day, they heard about a terrible color. It was a bright red, and it made them sad. "Let's not marry in this color," the mommy said. The daddy agreed.
So they kept on looking until they found the perfect color. It was a soft yellow with just a hint of orange. They thought it was beautiful, and they couldn't wait to get married in it.
Finally, the day came, and it was time for the mommy and daddy to get married. They dressed up in their soft yellow and orange clothes, and everyone cheered and clapped as they said their vows. They smiled and hugged and kissed each other, and it was the happiest moment of their lives.
Now the mommy and daddy live together and are very happy. They remind each other all the time of the wonderful yellow and orange color they chose for their marriage.
