John and his dad wanted to travel. So they put on their thick belts and went outside. They saw a big tree with a bushy top. Dad said they should travel to the top of the tree. So they started up the tree. Dad went first and John followed. They went slowly and carefully around the trunk and higher and higher. 
John got tired, but dad said they were almost there. And soon enough they were at the top! It was so high! John looked around and saw lots of things. Everywhere was green. There were birds and grass. 
They sat together at the top and looked down. Below them were houses and streets. Dad said they had traveled a long way and it was worth it. John smiled and hugged his dad. Then they slowly traveled down the tree and went home.
