Once upon a time, there was a little child named Timmy. Timmy loved to explore the world around him. One day, he went for a walk in the forest. He saw many interesting things like colorful flowers, big trees, and small animals.
As he was walking, he saw a glowing light in the distance. He was curious and wanted to see what it was. When he got closer, he saw that it was a firefly. The firefly was glowing and it looked so pretty. 
Timmy said, "Hello little firefly, you are so interesting. Why do you glow?" The firefly replied, "I glow because it helps me find my way in the dark." Timmy smiled and said, "That's so cool. I wish I could glow too!" 
From that day on, Timmy loved to watch the fireflies glow at night. He would always remember the interesting conversation he had with the little firefly.
