Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to imagine things in her head, like flying on a dragon or swimming with mermaids. One day, her mom said they were going on a trip to the beach. Lily was so excited! She imagined building sandcastles and collecting seashells.
But when they got to the beach, Lily didn't want to play in the sand. She was being stubborn and didn't want to have fun. Her mom tried to convince her to play, but Lily just sat there with her arms crossed. Then, her mom had an idea. She asked Lily to imagine that the sand was a big castle and they were the princesses who had to build it. Lily's imagination kicked in and she started to play. They had so much fun on their trip to the beach!
