Sam and Mia are playing in the park. They like to slide and swing and run. They hear a loud noise. It is a cop car. It has a siren and a light. The cop car stops near the park.
"Wow, look at that!" Sam says. "It is a cop car. Maybe there is a bad guy."
"Let's go see!" Mia says. "Maybe it is interesting."
They run to the cop car. They see a cop. He is talking to a man. The man looks angry. He has a big bag.
"Hey, kids, stay back!" the cop says. "This is not a game. This is a robber. He took money from the bank."
"Wow, a robber!" Sam says. "That is bad. Why did he do that?"
"Because he is greedy and mean," the cop says. "He wanted to have more money than he needs. But I caught him. Now he will go to jail."
"Jail?" Mia says. "That is scary. I don't want to go to jail."
"Me neither," Sam says. "We are good kids. We don't take things that are not ours."
"That's right," the cop says. "You are good kids. You should always be honest and kind. Then you will be happy and safe."
"Thank you, cop," Sam and Mia say. "You are brave and nice. You help people."
"You're welcome, kids," the cop says. "Now go back to your play. Have fun."
Sam and Mia wave to the cop. They run back to the park. They slide and swing and run. They are happy and safe. They think the cop car is interesting. But they think the park is more fun.
