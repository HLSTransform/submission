Once there was a wise bear who liked to raise his paws in the air. He wanted to do something special each day but he had no idea what to do.
He saw a little boy in the forest one day and they began to talk. "What do you like to do?" the bear asked.
"I like to raise my hat in the air!" the boy said.
"That's a great idea!" the bear said. "Let me try it!"
The bear started to raise his paws in the air and soon he was flying around the forest. He felt so happy and free. 
The little boy clapped and said, "You're so wise, bear! That's how I raise my hat too!" 
The wise bear smiled and was so glad that he had tried something new. From then on, he always remembered to raise his paws in the air.
