Once upon a time, there was an old lady. She was very old and people called her "elderly". One day, she lost her glasses and couldn't find them. She started to search for them everywhere. She looked under the bed, in the closet, and even in the kitchen. But she couldn't find them. 
Just then, a little girl passed by her house. She saw the old lady was upset and asked her what was wrong. The old lady told her that she lost her glasses and couldn't find them. The little girl wanted to help, so she started to search for the glasses too. 
After a little while, the little girl found the glasses on the table. She was so happy to help the old lady. The old lady was very grateful and thanked the little girl. From that day on, the old lady and the little girl became good friends. They would often pass by each other's house and say hello.
