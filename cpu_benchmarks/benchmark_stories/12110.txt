Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, especially after it rained. He liked to jump in puddles and splash around. One day, Timmy was jumping in a big puddle when he noticed his shoes were all wet.
"Oh no, my shoes are all wet!" Timmy said.
His mom said, "Don't worry, Timmy. Let's go inside and dry them off."
Timmy and his mom went inside and put his shoes in front of the fan to dry. After a while, Timmy's shoes were dry and cool to the touch. Timmy was happy, but he missed jumping in the puddles.
"I wish I could jump in puddles again," Timmy said.
His mom smiled and said, "Let's reverse the roles. We can put on our rain boots and jump in the puddles together!"
Timmy was so happy and they went outside to jump in the puddles together. They had so much fun and Timmy's shoes stayed dry this time. The end.
