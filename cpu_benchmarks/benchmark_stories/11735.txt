Once upon a time, there was a large penguin. He lived in a cold place and he was very lonely. One day he found some friends - he saw some small birds and he offered to play with them. They said yes and they started to have fun together! They built a snow fort, ran in the snow and laughed and joked. Suddenly a large polar bear appeared and offered them food. The penguin was very happy - he had found a new, large friend! The friends all shared the food and had a great time. They became the best of friends and played together every day.
