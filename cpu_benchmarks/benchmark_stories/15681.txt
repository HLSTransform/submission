Once upon a time, there were two friends, Alex and Dave. They both wanted to do something fun. So, Alex had an idea. He said, "Let's go and remove the jail wall!"
Dave shook his head. "No, that wouldn't be a good idea. We'd get in trouble!"
But Alex was determined. So, the two friends went and started to remove the jail wall.
Suddenly, a police officer heard them. He ran up to them and shouted, "You can't do that!"
Alex and Dave felt ashamed and got away as quickly as they could. Fortunately, the police officer didn't catch them.
The two friends never tried to remove the jail wall again. They learned that it was always better to listen to the rules.
