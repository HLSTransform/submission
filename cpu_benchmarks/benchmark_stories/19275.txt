Once upon a time there was a clever girl. She was very intelligent. She lived in a special town with lots of people who could speak different languages.
Every morning the clever girl woke up and looked out her window. One day, the sky suddenly started to turn dark. The clever girl knew that meant a tornado was coming so she ran outside.
The wind began to blow harder and harder. The people in town started to shout "Run and hide!" so they all ran into their homes. The clever girl found a safe place under her table and waited.
The tornado was strong and loud. The clever girl could feel the room shake. But after a few minutes, the storm was gone. 
When the clever girl came out of hiding, she saw that the town was still standing! Everyone was so happy and they cheered. Everyone agreed that the clever girl saved them from the tornado.
