One day, the mommy and the baby went for a walk. They found a big door and looked at it. It said "Exit". They wanted to test to see if it opened. Mommy pushed it, and it opened! She was surprised. They went inside and saw a lot of colors and toys. The baby was so excited that he laughed and bounced around.
Soon, the baby started to get tired. Mommy knew he was tired and was ready to go home. She said, "Let's go to the exit and test if it opens". The baby was happy and followed mommy. When they reached the exit, they tested it. It opened! They both hugged and laughed. They left and went home together. 
The day was fun, but the baby was so tired. He went right to bed. Mommy gave him a big kiss and said, "Good night".
