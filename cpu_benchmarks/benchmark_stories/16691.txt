Tom and Lily were playing in the park with their toy cars. They liked to make them zoom and crash on the grass. They pretended they were racing drivers and made loud noises.
"Look, Lily, I have a new car!" Tom said, showing her a shiny metal car. "It is very fast and strong. Do you want to try it?"
Lily nodded and took the car from Tom. She liked how it felt in her hand. She made it go faster and faster on the grass. She was having fun.
But then, she saw a big dog running towards them. The dog was barking and wagging its tail. Lily was scared of dogs. She dropped the car and ran to Tom.
"Tom, Tom, help me!" she cried. "The dog is coming!"
Tom saw the dog and grabbed Lily's hand. He was not scared of dogs, but he saw that Lily was. He tried to calm her down.
"Don't panic, Lily, don't panic. The dog is not bad. He just wants to play. See, he is smiling. Maybe he likes your car."
Tom looked at the grass and saw the metal car. The dog had picked it up in his mouth and was chewing on it. Tom felt sad. He liked his new car. He wanted it back.
"Hey, dog, that is my car!" Tom shouted. "Give it back, please. It is not a bone. It is a toy."
The dog looked at Tom and wagged his tail. He dropped the car and ran to Tom and Lily. He licked their faces and barked happily. He wanted to be their friend.
Tom and Lily were surprised. They saw that the dog was not mean. He was just curious. They petted his fur and laughed.
"Sorry, dog, we were scared of you," Lily said. "You are a nice dog. What is your name?"
The dog barked again and showed them his collar. It had a tag with his name on it. It said "Honest".
"Honest? That is a funny name for a dog," Tom said. "But you are a good dog. You gave me back my car. Thank you, Honest."
Tom looked at his car. It was a bit bent and scratched from the dog's teeth. But it was still shiny and strong. He smiled and gave it to Lily.
"Here, Lily, you can have it. You like it more than me. And you were brave. You did not panic for long."
Lily hugged Tom and took the car. She was happy. She liked the car and Tom. And she liked Honest, too.
"Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend. And you are honest, too. Just like the dog."
They played with the car and the dog for a while. They had fun. They were not scared anymore. They were happy.
