Tim and Sam liked to play in the garden. They liked to dig and plant and water. They liked to see the flowers and the bugs and the birds. But they did not like the big fence that was around the garden. The fence was old and brown and had holes in it. They wanted to see what was on the other side of the fence.
One day, they found a big hole in the fence. They looked at each other and smiled. They crawled through the hole and saw a new garden. But this garden was not like their garden. This garden was dark and dirty and had no flowers or bugs or birds. It had only weeds and trash and a bad smell. They saw a big pile of fruit that looked like it was rotting. The fruit was black and green and had worms in it.
Tim and Sam felt scared and sad. They wanted to go back to their garden. But then they saw something shiny in the pile of fruit. It was a can of soda. They liked soda. They thought it was sweet and fizzy. They ran to the can and opened it. They took a sip and made a face. The soda was not sweet and fizzy. It was sour and flat. It tasted like the rotting fruit.
Tim and Sam spit out the soda and threw the can away. They felt sick and sorry. They realized they had made a mistake. They crawled back through the hole and ran to their garden. They hugged their flowers and their bugs and their birds. They never went to the other side of the fence again. They learned that some things are not what they seem. And that their garden was the best garden in the world.
