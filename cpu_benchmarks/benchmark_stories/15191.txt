Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a boy named Tim. Tim found a rare stick in the woods. He thought it was a special weapon. He was very happy and wanted to show it to his friends.
Tim went to his friend, Sue, and said, "Look at my rare weapon! Let's play with it!" Sue was excited to see the stick and wanted to play too. They played a game where they pretended to be heroes with the rare stick as their weapon.
After playing, they saw a big dog. The dog wanted to play too. Tim said, "Let's let the dog play with our rare weapon!" Sue agreed, and they all played together. The dog, Tim, and Sue had lots of fun with the rare stick. And they all became best friends.
