Once upon a time there was a man who worked a very special job. Every day he would step into the deep water. He would wrap his arms around a big net, and then he would start to step. Step, step, step. He would take big, strong steps until he found what he was looking for. It was his job to find the treasures that hid in the deep water.
He would find little treasures like pebbles and shells. He would also find big treasures like starfish and coral. Every day he would bring his treasures out of the deep water, and then he would show them to all his friends.
The man's friends were always so excited. They were always so happy to see the man's amazing treasures. They would step closer to him and look inside his net to find a cool new treasure. They would ooh and aah at all the little things he brought out of the deep waters.
The man worked this job every day. He stepped into the deep water and found amazing treasures. He always made his friends smile with all his deep sea discoveries.
