Once upon a time, there was a nosy white rabbit. She hopped around the garden, looking for something to do. The rabbit was looking for someone to trust. Soon, she found a little girl in the garden, playing with a tea set. The rabbit knew she could trust the little girl, so she hopped over and asked her to play.
The little girl was so happy when the rabbit came over. She showed the rabbit her tea set and shared her toys with the rabbit. The rabbit felt very special and soon the two were playing together.
The little girl and the rabbit spent the entire afternoon playing together. The rabbit felt so happy to have a friend that she could trust. Every day the rabbit looked forward to playing with the little girl in the garden.
