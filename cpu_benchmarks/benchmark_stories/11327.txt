Once upon a time there lived a great little mouse. He loved playing and exploring everywhere he could. One day he saw a trap. It was made of metal and had a lock on the front. He had never seen anything like it before. 
He was curious and carefully he hopped closer to take a closer look. The mouse started to play with the lock and before he knew it, he felt himself falling. The trap had closed and he was stuck inside! 
He was so scared and he started to cry. But then he heard a voice from somewhere nearby. It was a cat. She said: "Don't worry, little mouse. I know how to unlock the trap."
The cat carefully unlocked the trap. Once it was open, the mouse was free again. He thanked her for helping and the cat said "you're welcome". 
The mouse ran off, safe and sound. From then on, he always knew to stay away from traps and locks!
