Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch cartoons on the TV. He would watch them all day long if his mom let him. One day, Timmy was watching his favorite cartoon when the TV suddenly paused. Timmy tried to fix it by pressing all the buttons on the remote, but nothing worked.
Timmy got sad because he couldn't watch his cartoon anymore. He decided to go outside and play instead. But when he went outside, he saw his terrible neighbor, Billy. Billy always teased Timmy and took his toys. Timmy didn't want to play with Billy, but he didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, Timmy had an idea. He remembered the cartoon he was watching before it paused. The cartoon had a character who stood up to bullies. Timmy decided to be brave like that character and stand up to Billy. He told Billy to stop being mean and to give back his toys. And you know what? Billy actually listened! Timmy felt proud of himself for being brave and standing up to the terrible bully.
