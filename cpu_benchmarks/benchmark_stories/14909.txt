A little boy named Joe was walking down the street with his mother. He punched her on the arm and she shouted, "Joe, don't be naughty!" Joe just ignored her.
A taxi drove past with a driver inside. The driver shouted, "Joe! My silly driver forgot to pay his taxes. I feel very guilty and I just wanted to let you know."
Joe and his mum stopped walking to listen. Joe looked very concerned. His mother asked, "What should we do?"
Joe said, "I think he should pay his taxes. Everyone should be honest and responsible. We should not ignore when something is wrong."
The moral of the story is that it is important to do the right thing and to be honest. Ignoring unfair or illegal practices is wrong.
