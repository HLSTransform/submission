Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and always carried her pencil with her. One day, she was drawing in the park when a big gust of wind came and shook the trees. Lily's pencil fell out of her hand and rolled away.
"Oh no, my pencil!" cried Lily.
A boy nearby heard her and asked, "What's wrong?"
"I was careless and my pencil fell away," said Lily.
"Don't worry, I'll help you find it," said the boy. Together, they searched and searched until they found the pencil.
"Thank you so much," said Lily, giving him a big hug.
"No problem, I'm happy to help," said the boy.
From that day on, Lily always made sure to hold onto her pencil tightly, but she also knew that there were kind people around who would help her if she ever needed it.
