Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to help his mom in the kitchen. One day, while they were making cookies, Timmy accidentally dropped an egg on the floor. His mom told him to wipe it up with a towel. Timmy wiped and wiped, but the floor was still a little bit sticky.
Later that day, Timmy and his mom went to the store to buy a light bulb. Timmy thought the light bulb looked very shiny and pretty. When they got home, they put the light bulb in the lamp and turned it on. The light was very bright!
That night, Timmy couldn't sleep because he had a persistent cough. His mom gave him some medicine and they cuddled together in bed. Timmy felt better soon and fell asleep with the shiny light bulb glowing in the lamp.
