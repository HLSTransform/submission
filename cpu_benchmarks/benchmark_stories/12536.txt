Once upon a time, there was a bird who had a cozy nest in a tree. The bird was happy and calm in its nest. But one day, a big storm came and blew the nest out of the tree. The bird was very sad and started to weep. 
The bird didn't know what to do, so it flew around looking for a new place to make a nest. It flew and flew until it found a nice spot in a bush. The bird worked hard and made a new nest. It was cozy and warm, and the bird was happy again. 
From that day on, the bird knew that even if bad things happen, it can always find a way to make things better. And if it ever feels sad, it's okay to weep and let the tears out.
