Lily and Ben are playing with their toy kitchen. They have many food toys, like apples, bananas, carrots, and onions. Lily likes to match the food toys with the right colors and shapes.
"Look, Ben, this is an onion. It is round and white and has many layers. Do you have another onion?" Lily asks.
Ben looks in his basket and finds a huge onion. It is bigger than his hand and has a purple skin. He is very proud of his onion and shows it to Lily.
"Wow, Ben, your onion is huge! It is bigger than mine. But it is not the same color. It is purple, not white. It does not match my onion," Lily says.
Ben does not care about the color. He likes his onion because it is huge. He thinks it is the best onion in the world. He puts it on the toy stove and pretends to cook it.
"I will make a yummy soup with my onion. Do you want some, Lily?" Ben asks.
Lily shakes her head. She does not like onion soup. She thinks it is too smelly and spicy. She prefers to eat carrots and apples. She finds two carrots and two apples that match and puts them on her toy plate.
"No, thank you, Ben. I will eat my carrots and apples. They are sweet and crunchy. They match each other and they match me," Lily says.
Lily and Ben are happy with their food toys. They play with them until their mom calls them for lunch. They wonder what mom has made for them. Maybe it is something that matches their toys. Or maybe it is something different and new. They are curious and hungry. They run to the kitchen to find out.
