Once upon a time, there was a kind boy named Timmy. He liked to play outside in the park near his house. One day, he saw a little bird who fell out of its nest and was sad. Timmy wanted to help the bird, so he built a little nest for it in the bush. 
Timmy was very thoughtful and wanted to make sure the bird was safe and happy. He brought the bird some food and water every day. The bird was very happy and chirped a lot. Timmy felt happy too because he was supporting the bird. 
Eventually, the bird grew bigger and stronger and was able to fly away. Timmy was sad to see it go, but he knew he had helped the bird and that made him feel good. From that day on, Timmy made sure to always be kind and supportive to all the animals he met.
