Once there was a boy named Jack. He was very curious and loved exploring. One day he went on an adventure and saw something incredible. It was a big, white bathtub in the middle of the forest! Jack was amazed. He carefully stepped inside and began to explore. Everywhere he looked, there were beautiful colors and shapes. He couldn't believe his eyes! 
At the far end of the bathtub, Jack noticed something. Something was staring at him. He felt a little nervous and he slowly looked over. There was a big, fat frog looking right at him! Jack and the frog just stared at each other for a moment before the frog hopped away.
Jack knew he had discovered something really special. He couldn't believe what he had seen. He decided to come back to the incredible bathtub every day to explore more. He was excited to see who else he might meet!
