Lila was a girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a doll, a ball, a car and a book. She did not like to share her toys with anyone. She said, "They are mine, mine, mine!"
One day, a raven came to her window. The raven was black and shiny. He saw Lila's toys and wanted to play with them. He said, "Hello, little girl. Can I play with your toys?"
Lila was angry. She said, "No, you cannot. They are mine, mine, mine! Go away, you bad bird!"
The raven was sad. He said, "But I have no toys. I only have feathers and a beak. Please, let me play with your toys. I will be your friend."
Lila did not care. She said, "No, no, no! You are not my friend. You are a thief. You want to take my toys. Go away, go away, go away!"
The raven was angry. He said, "You are a mean girl. You are not fair. You have many toys, but you do not share. I will punish you. I will take your toys and fly away."
The raven flew into Lila's room and grabbed her doll with his beak. He flew out of the window and said, "Ha, ha, ha! This is mine, mine, mine!"
Lila cried. She said, "No, no, no! Give me back my doll. You are a bad bird. You are a thief. Give me back my doll."
But the raven did not listen. He flew away with the doll and said, "No, no, no! This is mine, mine, mine! You are a mean girl. You are not fair. You do not share. This is your punishment."
Lila learned a lesson. She learned that sharing is good and being selfish is bad. She learned that being fair is nice and being mean is not. She learned that if she does not share, she will lose her toys and her friends. She said, "I am sorry, raven. Please, come back. Please, bring back my doll. Please, be my friend. I will share my toys with you. I will be fair and nice. Please, come back."
