Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, she saw a man with a frown on his face. He looked sad and unhappy. Lily wondered why he was feeling that way.
She decided to ask him a question, "Why are you sad?" The man looked surprised that a little girl would ask him that. He explained that he was worried about something important.
Lily thought for a moment and then had an idea. She went back to her friends and they all made a peaceful sign with their hands. They went back to the man and showed him the sign. It made him feel better and he smiled. From that day on, Lily and her friends made sure to spread peacefulness wherever they went.
