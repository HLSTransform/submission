Once there was a little girl who loved to play pretend. She loved to fly around the house wearing a cape and pretending to be a superhero saving the day. One day, while playing pretend she remembered that she wanted to go explore a rainbow. She was so excited that she ran to her room to pack her things. She packed her teddy bear and some silly clothes. Then she put on her cape and flew out the door. 
When she arrived at the rainbow she saw all of the colors of the rainbow stretching for miles and miles. She was so happy and began to fly around the sky exploring the colors of the rainbow. As she explored, she found many things like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and a cloud of butterflies just above. 
She had so much fun exploring the colors of the rainbow, it was turning from day to night. Suddenly, she heard thunder in the sky and it began to rain. The little girl was so sad that she wanted to go home, but luckily it was a rainbow rain and was not too heavy. 
So, she packed up her things, put on her cape and flew back home, feeling silly and happy.
