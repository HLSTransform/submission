Once upon a time there was a boy who wanted to write a letter to his friend. He took some paper and a pencil and went to his room. He opened his curtains and saw that it was a sunny day outside.
He sat down and started writing a silly letter. His sister came in to see what he was doing and asked him what he was writing. He told her it was a letter to his best friend, and she said it sounded like lots of fun.
The boy kept writing until his letter was finished. He read it out and his sister thought it was very funny. The boy folded up the letter and put it in an envelope. He jumped up and said "now I need to find a stamp." His sister said she knew where there were some stamps and she helped him find one and stuck it on the envelope. 
The boy was so excited to write the letter and send it in the post. He thanked his sister for helping him, and she gave him a big hug.
