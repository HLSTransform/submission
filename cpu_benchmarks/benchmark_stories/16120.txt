One day, Grandma and Grandpa went for a walk in the park. Grandma had a mild coat on because the air was cold. Grandpa wanted to order something to eat, so he ordered some ice cream for them to share. Grandma took off her mild coat and the two of them shared the ice cream. The ice cream was cold, but it tasted so good. Grandpa even got a small spoon for Grandma to eat her share. She was so happy! When they finished, Grandpa put Grandma's mild coat back on and they walked back home. It was a lovely day with Grandma and Grandpa.
