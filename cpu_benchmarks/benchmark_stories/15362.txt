Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jack and Jane. They wanted to go out and play but their bikes were broken and wouldn't work. Jane suggested they go find a mechanic to help fix their bikes. 
So, the two friends set out in search of a mechanic. Eventually, they found a white garage with a mechanic inside. The mechanic greeted them and asked what the problem was. Jack and Jane explained that their bikes wouldn't work. The mechanic thought for a moment and then suggested they should try changing the tires on their bikes.
Jack and Jane were very excited. They thanked the mechanic and went off to buy new tires. When they had finished, they fixed their tires to their bikes. Jack and Jane thanked the mechanic yet again and then went off to have fun!
