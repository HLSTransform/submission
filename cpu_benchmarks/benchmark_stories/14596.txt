One day, it was a lovely day, and so the family decided to go on a picnic. They packed up their things and went to a hill near their house.
When they got there, they saw a wonderful sight. The sky was a bright blue and there were pretty flowers everywhere. The family spread out their picnic blanket in front of a big tree and started to eat.
After a while, the wind started to blow. It moved the blanket around and the family laughed as they chased it. The blanket spread around the hill like a big blanket of love.
The family stayed for a while, looking at the lovely sight, until it started to get dark. They packed up their things and went home, happy that they had spent the day together.
