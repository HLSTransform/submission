Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to draw. She would take her crayons and paper and make pictures of everything she saw. One day, she wanted to design a special picture for her mommy's birthday. She thought and thought about what to draw, and finally decided to draw a purple flower.
Lily worked on her picture for a long time, making sure every minute detail was just right. She colored the petals a deep shade of purple and added green leaves to the stem. When she was finished, she proudly showed her mommy the picture. Her mommy was so happy and gave her a big hug.
From that day on, Lily knew that she loved to design things and make people happy with her art. She continued to draw and paint, always taking her time to make sure every minute detail was perfect. And her mommy hung the purple flower picture on the wall, where it reminded them both of the special moment they shared.
