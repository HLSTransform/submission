Jill and her mommy found a big, fun park to play in. Jill was so excited to play on the swings and slides. She could see a big, green hill too. Everything looked fit for playing! 
When they got to the park, Jill spotted a zebra! It was the most beautiful zebra she had ever seen. Mommy said they could go up closer to look at it. Jill ran up to the fence and stopped, because she wasn't allowed to go too close. 
The zebra started running and jumping around! It was so fun to watch! Jill and her mommy laughed and pointed and clapped as the zebra played in the grass. Jill was so happy she had found the zebra to play with. 
When it was time to go, Jill hugged her mommy and said goodbye to the zebra. She couldn't wait to come back to the park and play again.
