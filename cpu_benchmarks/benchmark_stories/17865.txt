Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Jill. She was getting ready to put on her shoes. 
Jill wanted to make sure her shoes fit just right. So she walked over to her dresser and picked up a shiny mirror. She loaded the mirror up with her shoes, and then held it up to see how they fit. 
Jill smiled as she saw her shoes in the mirror. They fit perfectly! She quickly loaded them on her feet and then danced and sang as she pranced around her room. 
Jill twirled and spun in her shoes, feeling so happy and fit. She looked into the mirror one more time before she went off to play. She smiled at the happy reflection in the mirror, and then skipped away.
