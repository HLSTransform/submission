One day, a small bird was flying in the sky. She saw a big brick on the ground. She went to her friend, the mouse, and told him about the brick. "I saw a big brick. Let's go see it," said the bird.
The bird and the mouse went to the brick. They saw that the brick was bitter and not good to eat. The bird had an idea. "Let's scatter seeds around the brick," she said. The mouse agreed, and they scattered seeds all around the brick.
Soon, the seeds grew into big, beautiful flowers. The flowers made the brick look nice and pretty. Many other animals came to see the flowers and the brick. They all loved it.
The bird and the mouse were happy. They learned that even if something is bitter and not good, you can still make it nice and pretty. This is the moral of the story: you can make the best out of any situation.
