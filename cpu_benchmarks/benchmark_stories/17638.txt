Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to chew gum all day long. One day, Timmy's mom brought him some cool news. "Timmy, we're going to the park today!" she said. Timmy was so excited that he started to jump up and down.
When they got to the park, Timmy saw his friend Billy. "Hey Billy, guess what?" Timmy said. "What?" Billy asked. "We're at the park!" Timmy replied. "Cool!" Billy said.
As they played on the swings and slides, Timmy's gum fell out of his mouth. "Oh no!" Timmy said. "My gum!" Billy saw it and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. Just chew another piece!" Timmy smiled and pulled out a new piece of gum. "Thanks, Billy!" he said.
After a fun day at the park, Timmy and his mom went home. "Did you have a good time, Timmy?" his mom asked. "Yes, I did!" Timmy said. "And Billy helped me when I lost my gum. He's cool!"
