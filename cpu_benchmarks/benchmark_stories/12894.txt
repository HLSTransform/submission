Once upon a time, there was a cute little pig. He loved to play outside and explore the world. One day, he decided to take a walk through the forest. As he was walking, he found a strange looking measure. He picked it up and started to twist it around. He had so much fun twisting the measure! As he kept twisting, he made the measure into a silly shape. Then he looked up to find a big surprise! A big dragon was twirling through the sky. The dragon came near and made a big twist in the sky. The pig and the dragon laughed together and had a great time. The pig kept playing with the measure, twisting it into different shapes, until it was time for him to go back home. He was so happy and smiled all the way!
