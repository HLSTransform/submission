Once upon a time, there was a big family of cats. They were happy and lived in a nice warm home. One day, the cats found a small box on the doorstep. Inside the box was a little creature. Its fur was soft and shiny and it had a friendly face. 
The cats welcomed the creature with open paws. They saw that it was harmless and wanted to make it a part of the family. But then the cats realized something was wrong - the creature was carrying a bottle of poison! 
The cats were worried about the creature, but it kept smiling and seemed perfectly safe. Finally, the cats accepted the creature and gave it a warm welcome into the family. From that day on, the creature and the cats lived happily ever after.
