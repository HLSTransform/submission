Once upon a time, there lived a little girl. Her name was Sarah. She was only three years old. One day, Sarah wanted to go outside. So she asked her mom for a license. Her mom said yes and gave her a special license.
Sarah was very happy and excited about her new license. She quickly put it in her pocket. Then she ran outside, out of the house. Outside, Sarah could hear all the noisy birds. She walked around and saw many different things. She saw a big garden and some big trees.
She stopped at the garden and started to play. She started to work on the garden. She weeded and planted some new flowers. She worked very hard and soon her garden started to yield some beautiful flowers.
Sarah was very happy and proud. She ran back home to show her license and her beautiful garden to her mom and dad. They were all very happy and proud of Sarah.
