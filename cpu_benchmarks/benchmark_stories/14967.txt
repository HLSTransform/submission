Anna was walking with her mom outside when a big, white bird caught her eye. "What's that Mommy?" Anna asked. Her mother smiled. "That's a swan. They are beautiful, aren't they?"
Anna nodded. Then she pointed to her chest. "What's inside here Mommy?" Her mom touched Anna's chest gently and said, "That's your heart. It's a very special part of you."
Anna was quiet for a moment. Then she said. "Is it difficult to take care of your heart?"
Her mom gave her a warm smile. "Sometimes it can be difficult, but it's worth it. When you love someone, it's important to mention it to them as often as you can. That will help you take good care of your heart."
Anna nodded and smiled. She knew that her mom was right. Taking care of her heart was important, and talking about it made it easier.
