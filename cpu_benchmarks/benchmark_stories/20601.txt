Once there was a little boy who was very lucky. He had a brand new x-ray toy at his house and he loved to play with it. He was playing with it one day, running around and imagining himself as an x-ray doctor.
His mom came in to check on him and reminded the little boy not to be too rough with his toy. He nodded and promised he would be careful.
The little boy kept playing, but then he had an idea. He ran to his mom and asked if he could take his x-ray toy to show his friends. His mom thought about it and said yes. She reminded him to enjoy his toy, but always be careful with it.
The little boy thanked his mom and raced off to show his friends. They were so excited to see the model x-ray that the little boy had. He was so lucky to have such a cool toy! He reminded himself that he was lucky and he thanked his mom for reminding him to be careful with it.
