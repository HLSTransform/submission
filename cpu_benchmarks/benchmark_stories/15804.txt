One day, Mary and her mommy went to the park. Mary was so excited to feed the ducks! She had a bag with her filled with crackers. 
The first duck they saw was big and fluffy. Mary smiled and ran towards him. She was about to give him the crackers when a big, mean duck made a loud noise and started to chase Mary. She started to cry and her mommy ran to help.
Mommy was very angry and she grabbed Mary's hand. She looked at the mean duck and said "Go away!" But the duck wouldn't listen.
Mommy then took a knife out of her pocket. The mean duck was so scared he flew away!
Mary was still crying and mommy hugged her. Mommy said "I'm sorry you were scared honey. Don't worry, I won't let anyone hurt you".
Mary smiled and hugged her mommy back. She knew her mommy would protect her no matter what. All was well and the ducks got their crackers in the end.
