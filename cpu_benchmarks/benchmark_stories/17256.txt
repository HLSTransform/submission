Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play at the park. One day, she met a boy named Jack. Jack was very nice and they became friends. They played together on the slide and had lots of fun.
After a while, Lily said, "I'm bored. Do you want to play something else?" Jack said, "Sure, let's play with my clock." Lily thought it was boring, but she didn't want to be rude, so she agreed.
They played with the clock for a little while, but then Lily accidentally broke it. Jack got very upset and said, "You broke my clock! I don't want to play with you anymore." Lily felt very sad and went home crying. She learned that sometimes it's better to say no to things you don't like, instead of pretending to like them and then causing trouble.
