Once there was a poor family that lived on a farm. The family had a small garden full of different fruits and vegetables. In the garden was a vine with delicious grapes. The mother in the family asked her three year old daughter, Sarah, if she would like a grape from the vine. Sarah eagerly nodded her head yes and made a request, ‘Can I have a grape, mummy?’ 
The mother picked a grape off the vine and handed it to Sarah. Sarah was happy to get the grape and said thank you. She smiled at her mummy before taking a bite of the grape that was sweet and juicy.
After eating the grape, Sarah asked for another one. The mummy said, “That was it for today. I'm sorry, but we don't have many grapes because we are so poor.” The little girl understood and said ‘Ok, mummy.’ She gave her mummy a big hug and went off to play.
