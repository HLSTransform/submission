Once upon a time, there was a bird named Fred. Fred loved to soar in the sky. He flapped his wings and felt the wind on his face.
One day, a hurricane was coming. The wind got stronger and the sky grew darker. Fred was afraid, but soon he remembered something he had heard – birds can fly and soar higher than the wind of a hurricane.
So Fred flapped his wings even harder and soon he was above the clouds. He soared higher and higher until he could not even see the hurricane anymore.
When the hurricane was gone, the sun came back out and Fred flew back down to the ground. After soaring so high, he was very tired, but also very proud of himself.
The storm had also brought with it an unexpected surprise – a huge, spoiled apple. As Fred ate it, he thanked the hurricane for giving him a tasty reward for his courage and hard work. 

And so, Fred learned that with courage and hard work, you can soar above even the strongest of storms.
