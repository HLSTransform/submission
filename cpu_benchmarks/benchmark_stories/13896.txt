Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Tom. He did not like to learn new things. One day, Tom's mom said, "You need a tutor to help you learn."
Tom did not want a tutor, but his mom found one anyway. The tutor was a wise owl named Mr. Hoot. Mr. Hoot came to Tom's house to teach him.
At first, Tom did not listen to Mr. Hoot. But Mr. Hoot said, "If you decide to learn, you will be smart and happy." Tom thought about it and said, "Okay, I will try."
Tom and Mr. Hoot worked together every day. Soon, Tom was not lazy anymore. He decided to learn and became very smart. Tom was happy, and his mom was proud of him.
The moral of the story is: deciding to learn and not being lazy can make you smart and happy.
