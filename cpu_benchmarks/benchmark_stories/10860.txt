Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she saw her friend, Max, slap his little brother. Lily felt uncomfortable and sad. She said to Max, "Why did you slap your brother? That's not nice."
Max replied, "He colored my picture black and I got mad."
Lily said, "It's okay to be mad, but it's not okay to hurt someone. You should talk to him instead of slapping him. And it's okay if your picture is black, you can make it beautiful in your own way."
Max felt bad and said sorry to his brother. Lily smiled and said, "See, talking is better than slapping. And it's important to be kind to others, even when we're upset."
