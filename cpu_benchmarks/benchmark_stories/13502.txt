Once upon a time, there was a fishy named Nemo. Nemo lived in a big ocean with his friends. One day, they decided to go on an adventure to find a reef. They swam and swam until they saw a big beautiful reef. They all stood in awe and looked at the pretty colors. They were so quiet, they didn't want to scare the fishies living in the reef. Nemo and his friends had so much fun exploring the reef and seeing all the different types of fish. They couldn't wait to tell their families about their adventure when they got back home.
