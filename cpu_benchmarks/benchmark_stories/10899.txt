Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride his bike all around the park. His mom always reminded him to wear his helmet and be careful.
One day, Timmy was riding his bike and noticed that his tire was starting to look flat. He didn't want to stop riding, but he knew he should take a break and fix it. He promised himself that he would always check his tires before going for a ride.
After fixing his tire, Timmy continued to ride around the park. As he was riding, he saw a big mud puddle. He wanted to ride through it, but he didn't want to get his clothes dirty. He remembered his mom always telling him to keep his clothes clean. So, he decided to ride around the puddle instead.
Timmy felt proud of himself for being responsible and keeping his promise to take care of his bike and his clothes. He knew that if he kept being careful, he could have lots of fun riding his bike without any problems.
