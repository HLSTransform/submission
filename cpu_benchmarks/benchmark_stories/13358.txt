Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and get dirty. But when her mommy said it was time to come inside and take a bath in the big white bathtub, Lily would get impatient. She didn't want to stop playing and go inside.
One day, Lily's mommy said, "Lily, it's time to clean up and take a bath." Lily didn't want to, but she knew she had to. She got in the bathtub and splashed around in the water. Her mommy helped her clean behind her ears and wash her hair.
After the bath, Lily felt so clean and fresh. She was glad she listened to her mommy and took a bath. From then on, whenever her mommy said it was time to clean up, Lily didn't feel so impatient anymore. She knew it was important to be clean and take care of herself.
