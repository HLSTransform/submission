Once upon a time, there was a big park. In the park, there were many kids playing. They liked to run, jump, and scatter leaves all around. One day, a new boy came to the park. He had an impressive flag with many colors.
The new boy said, "Hi, my name is Tim. Can I play with you?" The other kids said, "Yes, we can play together!" They all played a fun game. They took turns holding the impressive flag and running around the park.
As they ran, they would scatter the leaves with their feet. The leaves would fly up into the air, and the kids would laugh. They all had a great time playing with Tim and his impressive flag. And from that day on, they became the best of friends.
