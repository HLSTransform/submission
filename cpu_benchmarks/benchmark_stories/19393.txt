Once upon a time, there was a poor family. They had a small house and a small yard. One day, the little boy wanted to explore the yard. He opened the door and stepped outside. He was so excited to discover what he could find. He found some leaves, some sticks and some pretty flowers. He touched the soft leaves and smelled the beautiful flowers. He was surprised to find some ants crawling along the ground. He even discovered a bird's nest in one of the trees. He was so happy with his exploration that he went inside to tell his mom what he found. His mom smiled and told him that it was a wonderful discovery! From then on, he was out in the yard almost every day, looking for new and exciting things!
