Ben loves to look at the stars at night. He wonders what is out there, far away. He asks his mom to tell him stories about the planets. Mom says there are many planets, and some are big and some are small, and some are hot and some are cold.
One night, Ben has a dream. He is in a big rocket with his mom and dad. They are going to visit a planet. The rocket goes up, up, up, and Ben feels excited. He looks out the window and sees the Earth. It is blue and green and white, and it looks like a ball. He waves goodbye to the Earth.
The rocket flies for a long time, and then it lands on a planet. The planet is red and dusty, and it has big mountains and rocks. Ben puts on a special suit and a helmet, and he goes out with his mom and dad. They walk around and explore. Ben sees a small rock that looks shiny. He wants to take it home. He tries to lift it, but it is very heavy. He asks his dad to help him. Dad says the planet has more pull than the Earth, so things are harder to lift. He helps Ben lift the rock and put it in a bag.
Ben is happy. He has a souvenir from the planet. He thinks the planet is cool, but he misses the Earth. He likes the Earth better, because it is warm and has water and plants and animals. He tells his mom and dad he is ready to go back. They agree. They get in the rocket and blast off. They fly back to the Earth, and Ben sees it again. It looks bigger and brighter than before. He smiles and hugs his mom and dad. He can't wait to tell his friends about his dream.
