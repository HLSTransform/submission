Once there was a gifted girl called Jenny. She was a bit different to other children, because she was often worried about the future. One day when she was playing, she bumped her thumb on the table and it hurt. She began to worry that it would always stay hurt, but her mother promised her it would be ok.
Jenny felt better, but still worried about other things. She decided to make a list of all the things that worried her, and she felt better after that. Now when she got worried, she could take out her list and look at it to remind herself that she could solve the problem.
Jenny's thumb eventually healed, and she was so glad. She decided to share her list with her other friends, in case they were worried too, and she taught them how to make a list to help them. After that, Jenny wasn't so worried anymore, because she knew that if she was worried, she had a way to deal with it.
