Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Meg. She had a special purse that was open and she carried it with her wherever she went.
One day, Meg decided to go to the park. She brought her open purse with her and was very excited. When she got to the park, she saw a swing and ran over to it.
Reaching into her open purse, Meg discovered a surprise! Inside was a pink balloon that she had not seen before! Meg was very happy and said thank you to her purse for bringing her such a wonderful gift.
She grabbed onto the string attached to the balloon and ran around the park with it, laughing and smiling. As Meg skipped, her purse swung by her side. Meg felt so happy that she decided never to leave the park.
