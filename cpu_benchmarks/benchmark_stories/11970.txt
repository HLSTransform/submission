Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved playing with his computer. He would watch videos and play games all day long. Timmy's mom always told him to cover his computer when he was done playing. But Timmy was not obedient.
One day, Timmy forgot to cover his computer after playing. A big storm came and rain water got into his computer. The computer was broken and Timmy was sad. His mom told him, "I told you to cover your computer, but you didn't listen."
Timmy learned his lesson and promised to always be obedient and cover his computer. But it was too late, his computer was ruined and he couldn't play with it anymore. The end.
