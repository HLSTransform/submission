Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures of flowers and animals. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy some paint. She saw a fancy dress in the store and asked her mommy if she could have it. 
Her mommy said, "No, we can't buy it today, but we can look at it." 
Lily was sad but then she saw some peppers in the store. She said, "Look mommy, those peppers are so pretty! Can we buy them and paint them?" 
Her mommy smiled and said, "Yes, we can buy them and paint them any color you want." 
Lily was so happy and they went home to paint the peppers. She painted them pink, purple, and blue. They looked so pretty and she was proud of her work. 
Her mommy said, "Wow, Lily! You are a great painter. Maybe one day you can paint a fancy dress like the one you saw in the store." 
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, I will paint a fancy dress one day!"
