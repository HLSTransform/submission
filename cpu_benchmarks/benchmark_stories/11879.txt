Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jack. Jack wanted to play a game, but his friends didn't want to. They said it was too hard. Jack was sad.
Suddenly, he had an idea. He pulled out a long rope and said "Let's play tug-of-war." His friends felt better, and they all agreed to play. Jack was happy.
The game began and soon Jack was winning. His friends were not happy and tried to take the rope away from him. But Jack held on tight!
Then, his friend Tom had a cool idea. He said "Let's tie the rope to something, so no-one can win." Everyone agreed, and they tied the rope to a tree.
When it was finished, the friends all had fun. They laughed and shouted and accepted that the game was over â€“ but Jack had still won! Jack was very pleased.
