Once there was a little girl named Ruby. She was 3 years old and loved to play outside. One day, she noticed something very special up on her roof. It was a big, pink balloon. Ruby couldn't help but wonder how the balloon got there. She thought it must have been a special gift from the sky.
Ruby grabbed a ladder and set it up against the side of her house. She climbed up to the roof and carefully grabbed the pink balloon. It was made of brightly coloured paper, and had the word "love" written on it. Taking a deep breath she blew up the balloon, filling it with air until it was big and round.
For the rest of the day, Ruby watched in amazement as the balloon floated across the sky. Suddenly, it disappeared around a corner of the pink-painted house. The happy little girl smiled, knowing that the pink balloon had gone on a great adventure.
