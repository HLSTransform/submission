Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to go fishing with his dad. One day, they went to the lake to catch some fish. Tim was lucky and caught a big fish. He was so happy and wanted to show it to his mom.
When they got home, Tim's mom asked, "What did you catch today?" Tim replied, "I caught a big fish, Mommy!" He ran to his room to get his fishing rod and showed his mom the fish. She was so proud of him and said, "You can display your fish on the wall so everyone can see it."
Tim was excited to display his fish in his room. He put his fishing rod on the wall and placed the fish next to it. He went to bed that night with a big smile on his face, feeling very lucky to have caught such a big fish.
