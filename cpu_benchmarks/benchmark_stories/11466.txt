Once upon a time there were two creatures, one was a fluffy Bunny and the other a Slinky Snake. 
The Bunny said to the Snake, "Let's go bouncing!" 
The Snake answered, "Yes let's bounce!" 
So they hopped on the ground and bounced so high that they reached the underground. 
But the Snake saw how the Bunny was better at bouncing and got jealous. 
He said to the Bunny, "My bouncing is better than yours!" 
The Bunny replied, Smilely, "There is enough bouncing for both of us!" 
This made the Snake so happy that he bounced even higher than the Bunny, and for a long time, the two of them bounced around the underground filled with joy.
