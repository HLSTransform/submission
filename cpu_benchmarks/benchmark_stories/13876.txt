Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim liked to observe things. One day, he saw a pretty, expensive toy in a shop. Tim wanted the toy, but he did not have enough money. He felt sad.
Tim walked home and saw a small patch of flowers. The flowers were not expensive, but they were pretty. Tim picked some flowers and felt happy. He thought about the expensive toy, but he did not want it anymore.
The moral of the story is that you do not need expensive things to be happy. Sometimes, simple things like flowers can make you smile. Tim learned that it is better to enjoy what you have than to want what you do not have.
