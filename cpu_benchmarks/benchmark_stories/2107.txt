Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily wanted to play hide-and-seek with her friends. She looked for a good hiding spot, and she found a closet. She opened the door and went inside. 
But when she tried to leave the closet, the door wouldn't open. She pulled and pulled, but it wouldn't budge. She started to feel scared and called for her mommy, but her mommy couldn't hear her because she was deaf. 
Lily didn't know what to do, but then she remembered her mommy had taught her some sign language. She signed for help, and her mommy came to rescue her. From then on, Lily knew to always be careful when playing in closets. The end.
