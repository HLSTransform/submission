Once there was a little old man who lived alone in a small cottage. He was often sad because he had no friends. Every day he would stir a pot of soup, wait for someone to come to his door, and offer them a bowl.
One day, a lady heard about the old man's kindness. She wanted to help him, so she decided to pass along some of her joy. She made cookies and cakes, and brought them to the old man's cottage.
The old man was very happy. He had never experienced such kindness. He welcomed the lady in to his home and they had a wonderful time together. The old man laughed and told stories until it was time for the lady to go. 
The old man thought about the lady's kindness for a long time after she left. He decided that if he could, he would be kind to others just like the lady was to him. He knew that dead people can't be kind, but alive people can! That was a lesson he never forgot.
