Once upon a time, there was a big, hairy bear named Ben. Ben loved to play in the forest and eat honey from the beehives. One day, he saw a little bird named Lily who was trying to build a nest. 
"Hello, Lily! Do you need some help?" asked Ben. 
"Yes, please! I need some glue to stick these sticks together," replied Lily. 
"I can help with that! Let me snap some branches off this tree," said Ben. 
Ben snapped some branches off the tree and brought them to Lily. She used the glue to stick the branches together and build a cozy nest for her babies. 
"Thank you, Ben! You are a great friend," said Lily. 
"You're welcome, Lily! I'm happy to help," replied Ben with a big smile. 
From that day on, Ben and Lily became the best of friends and helped each other whenever they needed it.
