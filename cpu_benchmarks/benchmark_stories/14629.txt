Mia was playing in the garden when she saw something funny. On the ground, she spotted a little furry creature. It had a bump on its head and was trying to stitch it back together. Mia was very clever and decided to help the little creature. She knew it was worried, so she used her toy needle and thread to stitch the bump up. The creature thanked her with a friendly smile and promise to be more careful next time. Mia smiled and waved goodbye as the little creature scurried away. She felt quite proud of her clever work!
