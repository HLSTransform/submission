Once upon a time, there was a kind bunny named Benny. Benny liked to hop and play with his friends in the forest. One day, Benny saw a hunter with a big gun. The hunter was looking for animals to hunt.
Benny was scared and wanted to run away, but he saw his friend, a little mouse, was stuck in a trap. Benny knew he had to help his friend. He hopped over to the trap and tried to open it, but it was too strong. Then, he had an idea. He squeezed through the bars of the trap and helped his friend escape.
The hunter saw what Benny did and was surprised. He realized that not all animals were bad and decided to stop hunting. Benny and his friends were happy that they could play in the forest without being scared anymore.
