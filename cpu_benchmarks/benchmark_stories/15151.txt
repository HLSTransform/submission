Once upon a time there was a little boy called Jack. He was three years old and he was always looking for adventure.
Today he was feeling especially adventurous. He decided to search the ceiling to see what was up there. He looked up, but all he could see was white.
He asked his mother, "Mum, what's up on the ceiling?" His mum replied, "I'm not sure, Jack. I think we'll have to take a closer look to find out."
Jack was ready for the challenge! He climbed on a chair and searched the ceiling with his eyes. Suddenly he saw something sparkly at the corner of the room.
Jack couldn’t believe his eyes! He exclaimed, “Mum, look! It’s a star!” Even though it was just a reflection of the sun’s light on the window, Jack felt like he had discovered something special.
He was so happy with his discovery that he started to smile and dance around the room. He was glad he had chose to search the ceiling that day. What other adventures would he find?
