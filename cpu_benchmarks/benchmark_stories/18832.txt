Tom and Jen were going to visit their grandma. They had a big bag with clothes and toys. They were happy to see grandma and give her hugs.
But when they got to grandma's house, they saw a big mess. There were papers and books and cans everywhere. Grandma said a bad mouse was making the mess. She tried to catch the mouse with a trap, but the mouse was too smart.
Tom and Jen wanted to help grandma. They had an idea. They unpacked their bag and took out their toy cars and blocks. They made a road with the cars and a tower with the blocks. They put some cheese on top of the tower. They hoped the mouse would like the cheese and climb the tower.
They hid behind the sofa and waited. Soon, they heard a squeak. They saw the mouse run to the tower and nibble the cheese. But then, the tower fell down and the mouse was trapped under the blocks. Tom and Jen ran to the mouse and picked it up. They put it in a box with some holes.
Grandma was very happy. She thanked Tom and Jen for catching the mouse. She said they were very clever and brave. She gave them some cookies and milk. Tom and Jen were proud. They had helped grandma and had fun. They smiled and hugged grandma. They loved grandma and grandma loved them.
