Mandy was excited to go for a ride. She couldn't wait to get in the car and go. She sat in the backseat and saw the driver. The driver was very alert with his eyes on the road. Mandy smiling and waved at him.
The driver smiled back and started to drive. He drove quickly, but he was careful. He stayed alert as he drove.
Mandy admired the driver. She wanted to be like him when she grew up. She watched him drive and thought about what he was doing. Then, she had a great idea. She wanted to write, just like the driver was driving.
Mandy asked for a piece of paper and a pencil. Her mom handed her a notebook and a pencil and Mandy started to write. She wrote about all the things she could see out the window. She imagined stories about all the places she wanted to go.
Mandy was happy. She had found a new way to use her imagination. She was glad she was able to write just like the driver drove!
