Once upon a time there was a charming dragon. The dragon wanted to have an adventure, so it spread its wings and flew high up into the sky. When it reached the clouds, it saw a long track. The dragon decided to strike the track and fly along it. 
The dragon flew faster and faster and it felt so exciting! As it flew, it saw colorful birds in the sky and friendly clouds across the horizon. Finally, the dragon reached the end of the track and looked down. It had a great view of the ground, it looked so charming! 
The dragon enjoyed the beautiful sights before heading back home. As it flew back, it felt happy and excited about the adventure. From that day on, the dragon knew it would always have exciting things to explore.
