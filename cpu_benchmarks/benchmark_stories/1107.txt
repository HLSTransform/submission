Once there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to play outside every day with his friends. One day, he saw a flag blowing in the wind. He went to pick it up and could feel that it was really wet. He wondered what had happened and asked his friend, "What's wrong with the flag?"
His friend said, "It was raining yesterday and the flag soaked up all the water. So it's really wet now." Tim thought this was really cool and ran off to find his parents. He asked, "Can I have a flag too?"
His parents said, "Yes, but only if you promise to take care of it and keep it dry." Tim did just that and was so helpful to keep the flag clean and dry. He was very proud of his flag and looked after it every day. He flew it high and was so proud of it. 
The end.
