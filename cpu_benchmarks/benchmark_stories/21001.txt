Sammy was a little boy who loved to have picnics. He loved playing outside, exploring and eating yummy food. One day, he noticed something purple on the ground. He picked it up and found it was a pretty flower!
But then Sammy began to worry. Where had the flower come from? He didn't remember planting it. He wondered if he should put it back where he found it. He wanted to have a nice picnic, but didn't want the flower to be sad.
He decided that he would bring the flower to his picnic. He carefully picked up the flower and put it in his pocket. When he arrived at the picnic spot, he took out the flower and placed it in the grass. Then he began to enjoy his picnic. He felt happy having the flower join him.
Sammy had a lovely picnic, and he knew that the purple flower was happy too. He smiled and went on with his day, no longer worrying.
