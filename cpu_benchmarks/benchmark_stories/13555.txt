Once upon a time, there was a happy boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toys all day long. He had a big parade of cars, trucks and trains that he would push around his room. 
One day, Tim's mom took him to a big parade in the city. It was very modern and had lots of colorful floats with music playing. Tim loved watching the parade and clapped his hands with joy. 
After the parade, Tim went back home and continued to play with his toys. He imagined that his toys were in a parade too, just like the one he saw in the city. Tim was very happy and went to bed with a big smile on his face.
