Once there was a little girl whose name was Lucy. She was only three years old. Lucy loved her eraser very much. She enjoyed using the eraser to draw pictures of cats and dogs.
Every day, Lucy had fun playing with her eraser. She would make drawings in the sand and on the walls. Every time her drawings looked better, Lucy's parents would cheer her on and support her.
One day, Lucy found out about a very special competition. It was a competition for young children to make the most creative drawing with an eraser. Lucy was very competitive and wanted to try and win the competition. With the support of her parents, Lucy practiced hard every day and soon she was ready for the competition.
When the big day came, Lucy was very excited to show off her drawings. She competed very hard against the other children and in the end she won the competition! Everyone cheered for Lucy and she proudly showed off her eraser drawing.
From that day forward, everyone in town knew that Lucy was very talented and competitive. And Lucy was always sure to thank her parents for their support.
