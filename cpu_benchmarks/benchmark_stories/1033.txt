Once upon a time, there was a small, cute factory. It was owned by a friendly man named John. Every day, John would watch the factory make lots of beautiful things.
One day a magical spark appeared in the factory. It floated around, singing a sweet song. John watched this spark as it flew around, and he felt so happy.
Soon, the little spark changed and grew. It began to glow and turn in circles. Suddenly, the magical spark became a beautiful bird! The bird flew high in the sky, and then down towards John.
John felt so excited and hugged the bird. The bird sang its sweet song as they both danced around the factory. From then on, John and the bird were best friends. They played and laughed together every day, and watched the factory make lots of wonderful things.
