Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Blue. Blue had big, beautiful wings that she loved to flap and fly with. One day, Blue saw her friend Red flying high in the sky. Blue felt jealous of Red's wings because they were bigger than hers. 
But then Blue had an idea. She decided to pretend that she had the biggest wings in the world. She flapped her wings as hard as she could and imagined that she was soaring higher than any other bird. 
Suddenly, Blue heard a loud noise and looked down to see that Red had flown up to her. "Wow, Blue! You have the most amazing wings I've ever seen!" Red exclaimed. Blue felt happy and proud of herself for pretending to have the biggest wings. 
From that day on, Blue learned that it's okay to feel jealous sometimes, but pretending can make you feel better and even make your dreams come true.
