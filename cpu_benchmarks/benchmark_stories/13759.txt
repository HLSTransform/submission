Lila and Ben were playing in the forest. They liked to pretend they were explorers and find new things. They saw a big tree with a hole in it. They wanted to see what was inside.
"Let's go, Lila!" Ben said. "Maybe there is a treasure or a secret in there."
"OK, Ben. But be careful. It might be dark or scary in there." Lila said.
They walked to the tree and looked inside the hole. It was dark and they could not see much. They heard a growl and saw two yellow eyes. A big bear appeared from the hole. It was angry and hungry. It had an axe in its paw. It wanted to chop them and eat them.
"Run, Lila, run!" Ben shouted. "The bear has an axe. It thinks we are delicious."
Lila and Ben ran away from the tree as fast as they could. They did not look back. They reached their house and told their mom what happened. Their mom hugged them and gave them cookies and milk. She said they were brave and smart. She said they should not go to the forest alone. She said the bear was bad and dangerous.
Lila and Ben agreed. They said they were sorry and they would not do it again. They ate their cookies and milk. They were delicious. They were happy and safe. They forgot about the bear and the axe. They played with their toys and read their books. They had fun. The end.
