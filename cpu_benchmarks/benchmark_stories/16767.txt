Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big pile of stuff near the slide. They go to look at it.
"Wow, what is this stuff?" Tom asks. He picks up a stick and pokes the stuff.
"Yuck, it is smelly!" Mia says. She covers her nose with her hand. "It smells like old socks and rotten eggs!"
The stuff is brown and green and has flies around it. It is garbage. Someone threw it away and did not put it in the bin.
"Who did this?" Tom wonders. He is angry. "This is bad. It makes the park dirty and smelly. And it can hurt the animals and the plants."
Mia nods. She is sad. She loves the park and the animals and the plants. She does not like garbage.
"Let's tell someone," she says. She takes Tom's hand and they run to find a grown-up. They see a park ranger near the swings. They wave to him and tell him about the stuff.
The park ranger is glad that Tom and Mia told him. He thanks them and says he will clean up the stuff. He also says he will put up a sign to remind people to put their garbage in the bin.
Tom and Mia are happy. They helped the park and the ranger. They go back to play on the slide. They do not see the stuff anymore. They only see the sun and the sky and the flowers. They smile and laugh. They have fun.
