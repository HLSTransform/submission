Once upon a time, there was a kind mommy who lived in a small house. Every night, she would kneel beside her little girl's bed and say a prayer. The little girl loved it when her mommy kneeled beside her. She felt safe and loved.
One night, as the mommy kneeled beside her daughter's bed, the little girl asked, "Mommy, why do you always pray at night?" The mommy smiled and said, "Because at night, when it's dark outside, we can talk to God and thank Him for all the good things in our life."
The little girl thought about what her mommy said and felt very happy. She knew that her mommy was a modest person who always did the right thing. And she felt lucky to have such a kind mommy who kneeled beside her every night. From that night on, the little girl always felt safe and loved, knowing that her mommy would always be there for her.
