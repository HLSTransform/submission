Once upon a time, there was a turtle who wanted to escape. He was so slow that he couldn't get away. He had an idea! He found a hose and thought he could use it to fly away. He grabbed the hose and tied it around his neck. He ran as fast as he could and tried to fly away. But the turtle was still too slow. He couldn't get away. He ended up tangled in the hose and still can't escape!
