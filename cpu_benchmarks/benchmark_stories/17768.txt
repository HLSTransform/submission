Once upon a time, there was a little bird who wanted to escape its home. So one bright day, it left its tree and flew away.
The bird soared up and down until it found a huge tree with lots of ripe fruit. It ate some juicy apples and sweet oranges, then hopped around the tree looking for more.
But soon, the bird heard a loud noise from nearby. It was a serious bear, and it was looking for food! The bear was growling, and looked angry.
The little bird was scared, so it quickly flew away as fast as it could. It zoomed away from the big bear and flew back to its tree safe and sound.
The little bird was happy to have escaped the bear, and vowed to always stay away from serious animals. From then on, it was happy with just eating the delicious fruit from its own tree.
