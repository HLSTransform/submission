Once upon a time, there was a gray table. It was in a room with a little boy who loved to play with toys. One day, the boy was playing with his toy car and he accidentally bumped into the table. The table started to wobble and the boy got scared that it might fall over. 
But then, his mommy came into the room and saw what was happening. She quickly grabbed some tape and used it to prevent the table from falling over. The little boy was so happy that his mommy saved the table and his toys from falling down. From that day on, the little boy made sure to be extra careful when playing near the table.
