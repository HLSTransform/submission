Once upon a time there was a garden. It was smelly and had lots of yucky stuff in it.
One day a boy came to the garden and he had a bucket of water. He started to pour the water into the garden. The water spread all around, making it look clean and shiny.
The boy kept pouring the water and soon all the smelly things in the garden were gone. After he finished pouring the water, he looked at the garden and it was beautiful! The flowers were bright and colorful and the grass was smooth and green.
The boy was so happy with the garden that he decided to play in it every day. He would run around, laugh and have lots of fun.
The end.
