One day, a young girl named Anna wanted to borrow a notebook from her friend. Her friend was getting a new one, so it was no problem. Anna was excited and when she got the notebook she saw it had a special, shiny cover.
But Anna didn't know if she should keep the notebook or give it back. She was a bit ignorant and unsure. But, then she had a good idea. She decided to write a note in the notebook and ask her friend if she could keep it.
When Anna asked her friend, she was surprised by the answer: "Yes! You can keep the notebook. You can borrow it for as long as you need it." Anna was so happy!
Now Anna got to keep the notebook and it was a reminder of the generous, kind act from her friend. Anna had learned that it was better to ask than be ignorant.
