Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was very fond of playing. One day, she and her Mama were walking together in the city.
Amy said to her Mama, "I see a shop!"
Mama pointed around and said, "Yes, that's a shop. Do you want to take a closer look?"
Amy said, "Yes please!"
When they got to the shop, it was very filthy. Amy was surprised to see how dirty it was.
Mama said, "Look at all the dirt! We should not go in there. Let's go somewhere else."
Amy said, "Ok, Mama."
So Amy and her Mama went to a different shop instead. It was much cleaner and Amy was happy.
The end.
