Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to collect shells on the beach. One day, Timmy found a big, shiny shell that he wanted to keep. 
Timmy's mom saw the shell and said, "That's a very humble shell, Timmy. It's not worth much." 
Timmy didn't care. He loved the shell and wanted to keep it. But then he had an idea. 
He went to his friend Billy and said, "Do you want to buy my shell?" 
Billy said, "Sure, how much do you want to sell it for?" 
Timmy thought for a moment and said, "One dollar." 
Billy gave him the dollar and Timmy was happy. He realized that even humble things can be valuable to someone else.
