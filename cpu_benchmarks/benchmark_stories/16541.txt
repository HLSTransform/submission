Lily and Ben were in the car with Mom. They were going to the park to play. Mom was a good driver. She knew how to drive fast and safe.
But then, a big truck came from the other side. It was very loud and scary. It did not stop at the red light. It hit the car in front of them. There was a loud bang and a lot of smoke.
Mom was scared. She said, "Oh no, oh no!" She tried to stop the car, but it was too late. The car bumped into the truck. Lily and Ben felt a big jolt. They cried and hugged each other.
Mom said, "Are you okay, my loves?" She checked them for hurts. They had some bumps and bruises, but nothing bad. Mom was hurt too. She had a cut on her head and blood on her face.
She said, "We need help. We need to pray." She held Lily and Ben's hands and closed her eyes. She said, "Dear God, please help us. Please send someone to help us. Please protect us and the other people who are hurt. Please forgive the bad truck driver. Amen."
Lily and Ben said, "Amen" too. They felt a little better. They trusted God to help them.
Soon, they heard sirens. They saw lights. They saw people in uniforms. They were firefighters and paramedics. They came to help them. They put bandages on their hurts. They gave them water and blankets. They said, "You are very brave. You are very lucky. You will be okay."
Mom said, "Thank you, thank you!" She hugged Lily and Ben. She said, "God heard our prayers. He sent these helpers to us. He loves us very much."
Lily and Ben smiled. They said, "We love God too. And we love Mom. And we love each other." They felt safe and happy. They knew God was with them.
