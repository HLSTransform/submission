Once there was a little girl named Emma. Emma had an adventure every day but her current adventure was proving difficult.
Emma had to cross a smelly swamp to get to the other side. She gathered all of her courage and started to struggle, determined to reach the other side. 
But halfway through, Emma realized the swamp was much deeper than she had expected. The muddy water was covering her feet and she was having a hard time staying afloat. 
Suddenly, a frog started to speak. "Hey, little one! I can help you get across," he said.
Emma was surprised. She said, "Please, how can you help me?" 
The frog smiled. "Well, hop on my back and I'll carry you to the other side in no time!"
Emma smiled and jumped on - relieved to have a reliable way out. With a few strong kicks, the frog moved across the swamp and finally dropped Emma off at the other side. 
"Thank you so much!" Emma said. 
"You're welcome!" said the frog, and winked before hopping away. 
Emma thanked her lucky stars. She had made it across the smelly swamp after all!
