Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went on an adventure in the park. She looked for her lost toy, but she couldn't find it anywhere. Lily felt sad and weak, but she didn't want to give up. She continued to search for her toy.
Suddenly, Lily needed to go potty. She looked around and saw a toilet nearby. She went inside and felt much better. When she came out, she saw her toy on the ground! She was so happy and excited that she found it.
Lily learned that even when things seem hard and she feels weak, she can still find what she is looking for if she keeps trying.
