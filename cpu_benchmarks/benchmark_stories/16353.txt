Once upon a time, there was a happy little dog named Mark. Mark loved to play and run around in the park. One sunny day, Mark met a new friend, a little girl named Lily.
"Hi, I'm Lily!" said the little girl. "Do you want to play with me?"
Mark wagged his tail and barked, "Yes, let's play!" They played fetch and ran around, having lots of fun.
After playing, they sat down under a big tree. Lily said, "Mark, we made history today! We are the best of friends now." Mark barked happily and licked her face. They knew they would be friends forever.
