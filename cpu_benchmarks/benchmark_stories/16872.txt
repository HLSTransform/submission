Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a big, red ball. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help with the laundry. She gave Lily a basket and asked her to put all the dirty clothes in it. Lily was happy to help her mom and started to collect the clothes.
While she was collecting the clothes, Lily's little brother came into the room. He saw the big, red ball and wanted to play with it. He started to play with it and it hit the basket, making all the clothes fall out. Lily got upset and said, "You disturbed the basket and hurt my clothes!" Her brother felt bad and said sorry. Lily forgave him and they both started to put the clothes back in the basket.
The moral of the story is that it's important to be careful and not disturb things that don't belong to us. It's also important to say sorry when we hurt someone or something.
