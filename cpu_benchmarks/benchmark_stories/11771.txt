Once upon a time, there was a big, clean engine. Everyday, the engine offered to help the people living nearby. It helped do work in the garden and it even made the roads nice and smooth.
The people were very happy. But then one day, the engine started to make weird noises. Everyone was worried. What could be wrong?
The people had to find out. They asked the engine what was wrong, but it did not answer. So the people called for help.
Soon, a friendly mechanic came to help. The mechanic looked at the engine and said, "Ah, I see what's wrong!" The mechanic fixed the engine and it started to work again. The engine was nice and clean.
The people were so relieved and they thanked the mechanic. The mechanic smiled and said, "You are welcome, I am happy to offer help to the people living in this town."
