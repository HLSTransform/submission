Once upon a time there was a humble farmer. Every day he requested help from the animals on his farm, but they were too busy to help him.
One day he asked the animals to help him build a raft. The animals were excited and gathered some wood from the forest. They also gathered some strong rope to tie the raft together.
The farmer thanked the animals for their help as they finished building the raft. He happily said he would use the raft to move around the lake. 
The animals waved goodbye as the farmer requested, and the raft slowly moved away. He was so happy with the raft! 
The humble farmer thanked the animals every time he saw them, as they had helped him make his raft a reality.
