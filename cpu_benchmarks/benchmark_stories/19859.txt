Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was very obedient and always listened to his owner. One day, Max was playing in the backyard when he saw a pit. 
Max's owner had told him to ignore the pit because it was dangerous. But Max was curious and wanted to explore the pit. He tried to go closer, but his owner called him back and said "No Max, ignore the pit!"
Max listened to his owner and walked away from the pit. He felt proud of himself for being obedient. From that day on, Max never went near the pit again.
