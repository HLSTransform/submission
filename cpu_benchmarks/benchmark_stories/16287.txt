Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Ben. One day, he went to the market with his mom. At the market, there were lots of people and vendors selling different things. 
When Ben got to the market, he saw a big pile of hot pretzels. He wanted one really bad. Ben went up to the vendor and asked if he could have one. The vendor said yes, but he wanted Ben to pinch his nose first. 
Ben was a bit unsure, but he did what the vendor asked. When Ben pinched his nose, the vendor laughed and gave him a warm, soft pretzel. Ben was very happy and he thanked the vendor. 
Back at home, Ben ate his pretzel and shared it with his family. Everyone said it was so yummy and hot, and Ben couldn't have been happier.
