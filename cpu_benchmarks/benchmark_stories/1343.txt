Once upon a time there were two friends, Tony and Fred. They were best buddies and always did things together. One day, Tony said to Fred, "Hey, let's have an adventure!"
Fred said, "Yeah, let's do it!" So they set off into the woods. After a long walk, Tony said, "Let's settle here for a bit and have a picnic."
When they sat down and opened their picnic basket, there was cheese! Yum, thought Tony. They each had some cheese; it was bitter but Tony still liked it. Fred thought it was too bitter and didn't want to eat it.
Tony said, "Come on, Fred, it's not that bad!" Tony had another bit and he thought it tasted great! So eventually, Fred tried it and the two of them ate the cheese and enjoyed their picnic.
The two friends laughed and hugged each other, glad that they had enjoyed the cheese together. And they settled there, in the woods, enjoying their adventure.
