Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to drink juice from her favorite cup every day. One day, Lily accidentally dropped her cup and it broke into many pieces. She was very sad and cried a lot.
But then, her mommy hugged her and said, "Don't worry, Lily. We can get you a new cup." Lily was surprised and happy to hear this. Her mommy took her to the store and they picked out a new cup together.
After they got home, Lily felt calm and happy again. She learned that even when bad things happen, there is always a way to make things better. And sometimes, a surprise can make things even better than before.
