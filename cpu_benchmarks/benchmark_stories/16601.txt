Tom and Lily liked to play chess with their dad. Chess was a game with black and white pieces that moved on a board with squares. Tom and Lily learned how to move the pieces from their dad, who was very good at chess. Sometimes they won, and sometimes they lost, but they always had fun.
One day, they decided to play chess outside, in the garden. They brought the board and the pieces and set them on a table under a big tree. The sun was shining and the sky was blue. They saw many flowers in the garden, of different colors and shapes. They smelled sweet and pretty.
Tom moved his king to a safe square. Lily moved her queen to attack Tom's rook. Dad watched and smiled. He was proud of his children. He pointed to a flower near the table. It was orange and round, like a ball. "Do you know what this flower is called?" he asked. "It is a marigold. It blooms in the summer, when it is warm and sunny. It is one of my favorite flowers."
Tom and Lily looked at the flower. They liked it too. It was bright and cheerful. They wanted to touch it, but they remembered that dad said not to pick the flowers, because they were alive and needed water and soil. They said thank you to the flower for being so beautiful. Then they continued their chess game, happy and curious.
