Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and imagine she was in a magical world. One day, she found a thick leather book in her attic. She asked her mom, "What is this?"
Her mom replied, "That's my old diary from when I was a little girl. I used to write down my thoughts and dreams in it."
Lily opened the book and saw pictures and stories her mom had written. She said, "Wow! This is amazing! Can I imagine stories too?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course! You can imagine anything you want in this book." From that day on, Lily wrote her own stories in the thick leather book and imagined all sorts of adventures.
