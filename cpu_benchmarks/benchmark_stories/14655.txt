Once upon a time, there was a humble event. At this event, many people came together to enjoy it. One of these people was Joe. He was very excited but also a bit scared. He had never been to an event before. 
From across the room, Joe spotted an activity that looked very fun. He cautiously walked closer and noticed a bright, red ball on the floor. Hesitantly, he bent down to pick it up. Suddenly, it started to move and Joe jumped back.
Joe then realised it was a game. He watched carefully as other people took turns to strike the red ball with a stick. He joined in and took a turn. When it was his turn, he held the stick tight and carefully struck the ball. Everyone cheered and clapped as Joe's red ball moved away. 
This was Joe's first time playing a game and he was so proud of himself. He felt happy and excited about the humble event. Joe's family was so proud of him too!
