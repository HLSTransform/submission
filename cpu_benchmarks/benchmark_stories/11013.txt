Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big cage with a parrot inside. The parrot had many colors and a long tail. It looked very fancy.
"Hello, parrot!" Lily said. "What is your name?"
The parrot did not answer. It just made a loud noise.
"Maybe he is shy," Ben said. "Or maybe he is hungry. Let's find some food for him."
They looked around and saw some nuts on a tree. They picked some and set them on the ground near the cage.
"Here, parrot, have some nuts," Ben said. "They are yummy and good for you."
The parrot looked at the nuts. He came closer and pecked at them. He liked them very much. He made a happy noise.
"Thank you, kids," the parrot said. "My name is Coco. You are very nice."
Lily and Ben were surprised. The parrot could talk!
"Wow, Coco, you can talk!" Lily said. "That is so cool. Can you say more words?"
Coco nodded. He repeated some words that Lily and Ben said. He also said some words that he learned from his owner. He said hello, bye, good, bad, pretty, and funny.
Lily and Ben laughed. They liked Coco a lot. They played with him for a while. They asked him questions and he answered. They told him stories and he listened.
They had a lot of fun with the fancy parrot.
