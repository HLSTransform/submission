Once there was a boy named Josh who loved to play baseball. He had a big blue baseball hat and he was very careful with it. Every day, Josh would take his hat outside and he'd practice hopping while holding it. He'd jump up and down as he hopped around the yard. He'd even hop all the way to the end of the street, and then all the way back! He had so much fun.
One day, Josh was hopping and he accidentally dropped his hat. He quickly picked it up and examined it to make sure it was okay. To his relief, it was still in one piece! He put his baseball hat back on and kept hopping.
The next day, Josh was extra careful as he hopped around. He jumped over puddles and hopped around trees. After an hour of hopping, he looked down and saw his baseball hat! He was so glad he had been careful enough to keep it safe. From then on, Josh kept jumping and hopping around, always being careful with his baseball hat.
