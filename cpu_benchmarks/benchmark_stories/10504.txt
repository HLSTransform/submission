Jimmy was a young boy who loved to work. He was only three but he could work hard like an adult. Every day he worked in his garden digging and planting flowers. To help him remember, Jimmy kept a diary.
One day, Jimmy noticed a delicate butterfly fluttering around. He wanted to keep it as a special pet. He carefully planned how to catch it and wrote it down in his diary.
The next day, Jimmy went back to work. He carefully followed his plan from the diary and before he knew it he had caught the butterfly. It was so delicate, he gently placed it in a glass jar with some flowers. 
Jimmy was so proud of his work! He beamed as he looked at the butterfly in its jar and saw how much it liked its new home. He had worked hard for this reward and it was worth it.
