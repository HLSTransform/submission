Once upon a time, there were two friends called Susie and Ben.
They were playing in the park with their dog, Sparky. Susie saw a big metal pole and said to Ben, "Let's jump over the pole!"
Ben said "Let's do it! I bet we can jump really high."
They lined up and each one took a turn running and jumping over the pole.
Susie surprised herself by jumping really high. Ben made it look easy and jumped even higher than Susie.
Sparky even tried, but the pole was too heavy and he just barked. Everyone laughed.
Then Susie and Ben lay down and watched the clouds in the sky. They had lots of fun playing together.
