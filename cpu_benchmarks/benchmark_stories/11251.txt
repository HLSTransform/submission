Once upon a time there was a dark eraser. Every day it watched as the other erasers were released for play. They would be carried away by happy hands and fly through the air to their destination. The dark eraser wished it could join them. 
One day, a small child passed by and saw the dark eraser. He picked it up and asked its name. "I'm scared," said the eraser. The child answered, "Don't be afraid, I promise to release you and take you on an adventure." The dark eraser was filled with excitement. 
The thrill of freedom was like flying through the sky. The dark eraser soaked in the sunshine and felt the softness of the grass. The dark eraser had never felt so alive. 
As the sun began to set, the child sadly said, "Tomorrow I have to go back home. You must stay here until I come back." 
The dark eraser started to cry and said, "But I don't want to be alone. I want to be released and go with you." The child hugged the dark eraser and said, "You can come with me. Good friends should never be apart."
The moral of the story is that when you make a new friend you should never be apart. As long as you have the strength to hold on, true friends will never release each other.
