Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to eat candy. One day, she found a big bag of colorful candies and she ate them all at once. Suddenly, she felt sick and her tummy hurt a lot. 
Lily's mom noticed that she was not feeling well and asked her what happened. Lily said, "I ate too much candy and now my tummy hurts." Her mom said, "Oh no, this is an emergency! We need to go to the doctor." 
At the doctor's office, Lily told the doctor that her tummy hurt and she felt like she couldn't hear very well. The doctor said, "Don't worry, you're not deaf. You just have a tummy ache from eating too much candy." The doctor gave Lily some medicine to help her feel better. 
Lily learned her lesson and promised to never eat too much candy again. She thanked her mom and the doctor for helping her and said, "I don't want to taste too much candy and get sick again."
