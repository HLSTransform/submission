Once upon a time, in a big green forest, an orange bear named Buzzy lived. Buzzy was a very happy bear. He loved to play with his friends, the birds and the rabbits. One day, Buzzy found a shiny rock. He wanted to make it even shinier, so he decided to polish it.
Buzzy found a soft cloth and started to rub the rock. He rubbed and rubbed until the rock was very shiny. He was so proud of his work. Buzzy wanted to show his friends his shiny rock.
Buzzy went to his friend, a little bird named Chirpy. "Chirpy, look at my shiny rock!" said Buzzy. Chirpy looked at the rock and said, "Wow, Buzzy! That is a very shiny rock. You did a great job!" Buzzy smiled and thanked Chirpy.
Next, Buzzy went to his friend, a tiny rabbit named Hoppity. "Hoppity, look at my shiny rock!" said Buzzy. Hoppity looked at the rock and said, "Oh, Buzzy! That is the shiniest rock I have ever seen. You did a great job!" Buzzy smiled and thanked Hoppity.
Buzzy was very happy that his friends liked his shiny rock. He decided to keep polishing it every day, so it would always stay shiny. And Buzzy, Chirpy, and Hoppity played together in the big green forest, having lots of fun with the shiny rock.
