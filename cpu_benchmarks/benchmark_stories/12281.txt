Once upon a time there was a chubby little patch. His name was Patchy. He liked to store things. He stored all sorts of things in his patch, like acorns and sticks. One day, Patchy went to the store to buy himself something special.
When he arrived, he saw a big box of chocolates. His eyes lit up and he started to get excited. He turned to the person in the store and said:
"Please, can I have a box of chocolates?"
The person smiled and said:
"Of course you can, Patchy. Let me wrap them up for you."
Patchy smiled. He thanked the person and took the box of chocolates back to his patch. He ate the chocolates and enjoyed them very much. From then on, Patchy always stored his special things in his patch.
