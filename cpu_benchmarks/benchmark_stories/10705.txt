Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the garden. One day, she saw a frog jumping around in the grass. The frog was green and had big eyes. Lily thought the frog was cute.
Lily went inside to get some cookies. She accidentally dropped some crumbs on the ground. The crumbs made a messy pile. Lily didn't clean it up because she was in a hurry to go back outside.
When Lily came back outside, she saw that the frog had hopped over to the messy pile of crumbs. The frog was eating the cookies! Lily was happy to see the frog enjoying the cookies. She decided to repeat this every day and share her cookies with the frog. From that day on, Lily and the frog became good friends.
