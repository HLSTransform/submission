One night, a little boy named Jack woke up. He heard a noise coming from near his bed, so he looked around and saw a filthy mosquito. It had big, scary eyes and it was buzzing loud. Jack was very scared, so he jumped out of bed, ran out of his room, and went to find his mommy.
Jack's mommy heard his cries and went to his room. She saw the mosquito and knew how to get rid of it. She grabbed a tissue and clapped her hands. The mosquito flew away.
Jack felt so much better. He thanked his mommy, gave her a big hug, and then went back to bed. He drifted off to sleep knowing he wouldn't have to worry about any more filthy mosquitoes.
