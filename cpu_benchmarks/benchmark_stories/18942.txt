Once upon a time, there was a little rug. The rug was troubled because it could not hear. It wanted to hear the sounds of the world.
One day, the rug met a friendly cat. The cat saw that the rug was troubled. The cat said, "I can help you hear, little rug." The rug was happy.
The cat put the rug on its back and walked around. The rug could now hear the wind, the birds, and the people. The rug was no longer troubled. It was very happy to hear the world with the help of the friendly cat.
