Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing on the swings and slide on the slide. But their favorite thing was to seat on the bench and look at the pond. They saw ducks and fish and frogs in the water.
One day, they saw a man with a long, thin stick. He had a hook at the end of the stick. He threw the hook into the pond and waited. Lily and Ben were curious. They went to the man and asked, "What are you doing?"
"I am fishing," the man said. "I want to catch a big fish for my dinner."
Lily and Ben watched the man. They saw the hook go up and down in the water. Sometimes, the man pulled the stick hard. He said, "I got one!" But then, he looked sad. He said, "Oh, no, it is too small." He let the fish go back into the pond.
Lily and Ben felt sorry for the man. They wanted to help him. They looked around and saw some bread on the bench. They broke the bread into small pieces and threw them into the pond. The ducks and the fish and the frogs came to eat the bread. They made a lot of noise and splashed the water.
The man saw the bread and the animals. He smiled and said, "Thank you, kids. You are very kind. You made the pond happy. And you made me happy, too. Here, take this." He gave Lily and Ben a shiny coin each. He said, "You can buy some ice cream or candy with this. Have a nice day."
Lily and Ben were happy. They said, "Thank you, sir. You are very nice. Have a nice day, too." They waved goodbye to the man and ran to the ice cream truck. They bought some ice cream and ate it on the bench. They looked at the pond and saw the ducks and the fish and the frogs. They said, "We are happy, too."
