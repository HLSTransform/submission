Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very hungry and wanted a sandwich. Her mommy made her a sandwich with black bread and yummy cheese. Lily took a big bite and said, "Mmm, this is so good!"
Suddenly, her little brother came into the room and wanted a bite too. Lily said, "Okay, I will pass you a piece." She gave him a small piece and he ate it happily. 
After they finished their sandwiches, Lily and her brother went to play outside in the sunshine. They built a sandcastle and played with their toys. It was a fun day for Lily and her brother. The end.
