Once there was a mouse who was looking for a home. He searched around until he found an attractive safe. The mouse was very happy and he thought; “this is perfect for me!”
The mouse did his best to try to open the safe. He used his sharp claws and tried pushing, but nothing worked. He felt sad and started to cry.
Suddenly, a bee flew by and said to the mouse; “Hey! Why don’t you ask the key holder for help?” The mouse thought this was a good idea. He thanked the bee and ran to find the key holder.
When he found the key holder, the mouse politely asked; “Can you please open this safe for me?” The key holder was happy to help, so he opened the safe for the mouse.
The mouse was relieved and thanked the key holder for his help. Then the bee said; “Never give up trying, you may find the help you need.”
The moral of the story is that it’s important to never give up when trying to achieve something. With the help of others, anything is possible!
