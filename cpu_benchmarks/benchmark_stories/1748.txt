One day, the farmer grabbed his pitchfork and started to walk out to the barn. He opened the doors of the barn and inside were two big, brown bulls. The farmer was so excited that he clapped his hands together. 
The farmer shouted, "Who wants to be first? To go for a walk in the meadow and see the flowers and the trees?" 
The two brown bulls stamped their feet and started to dance around. The farmer bounded into the pen with them and started to push them to the door. He said, "Come on now, let's go outside together."
The two bulls raced ahead and soon the farmer and the bulls were out in the fresh air. They started to trot and play around in the meadow. The farmer watched the bulls with a smile on his face, he was so excited to see them in the meadow enjoying the scenery. 
The farmer and the two brown bulls stayed in the meadow playing and running around until they were too tired to go on. As they trotted back to the barn, the farmer smiled thinking how excited the two bulls had been.
