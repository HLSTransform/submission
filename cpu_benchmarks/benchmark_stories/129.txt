Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved summer because he could play outside all day long. One day, Timmy went to the park and saw a little girl sitting alone on a bench. Timmy went to talk to her and asked if she wanted to play with him. The little girl was shy at first, but Timmy was patient and waited for her to feel comfortable. They played together all day and had so much fun. From that day on, they became best friends and played together every summer.
