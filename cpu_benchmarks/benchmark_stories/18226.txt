Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a little hut. In this hut, a man would sell incredible things. People from all over would come to see what he had.
One day, a little boy named Tim came to the hut. He wanted to buy something incredible for his mom's birthday. The man showed Tim many things, but Tim wanted something very special.
Finally, the man showed Tim a beautiful flower that would never die. Tim knew this was the perfect gift for his mom. He bought the flower and gave it to his mom. She loved it and they lived happily ever after.
