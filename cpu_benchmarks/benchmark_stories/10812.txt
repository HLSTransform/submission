Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy and his mom went for a walk and they saw a big factory. Timmy asked, "What's that?" and his mom said, "It's a place where people make things."
Timmy wanted to see inside the factory, so his mom took him in. They saw lots of machines and people working. Timmy said, "Wow, that's cool!" Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and the machines started to shake. Timmy's mom said, "We have to leave now, it's not safe."
As they were leaving, a big machine fell over and Timmy's mom pushed him out of the way. She got stuck under the machine and couldn't move. Timmy tried to help, but it was too tight. He cried, "Mommy, stand up!" But she couldn't. Timmy was very sad because he loved his mommy very much and didn't want anything bad to happen to her.
