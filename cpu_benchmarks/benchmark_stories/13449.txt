Once upon a time, there was an old house. It had a big hall with lots of doors. One day, a little girl named Lily came to the house. She was scared because the house looked spooky. 
Suddenly, she heard a voice saying, "Hello, little girl. What brings you here?" Lily turned around and saw an old man with a kind face. "I'm looking for my cat," she said. 
The old man smiled and said, "Don't be scared, little one. Let's look for your cat together." They searched the hall and found the cat hiding behind an old chair. Lily was happy to find her cat and thanked the old man. She realized that the old house wasn't so scary after all.
