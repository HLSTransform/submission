Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack loved to play in his garden and watch his plants grow. One day, Jack noticed that his favorite plant wasn't growing well. It made him sad. 
Jack decided to jog to the store to buy some special food for his plant. On his way to the store, he saw a black cat that was stuck in a tree. Jack knew he had to help the cat. 
After he helped the cat, Jack went to the store and bought the special food for his plant. He gave it to the plant and it started to grow big and strong. Jack was very happy. 
The moral of the story is that if we help others, good things will grow in our lives.
