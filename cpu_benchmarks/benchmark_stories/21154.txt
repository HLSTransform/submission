Once there was a girl named Sue. Sue was glad to be outside as the sun was shining and the sky was a deep blue.
Suddenly Sue heard a loud rumble in the sky and she saw dark clouds. She knew that a storm was coming and she began to worry.
But then the sun came out again, making Sue feel glad. The storm had passed over and Sue was happy and relieved.
The wind gently blew and the birds sang their cheerful songs in the trees. Sue smiled and thanked the sky for the relief. She was so glad that the storm was gone.
