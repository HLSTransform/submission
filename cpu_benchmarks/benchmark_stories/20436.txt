Once upon a time, there was a big and strong lion who lived in a forest. He was very wealthy and had a lot of food to eat. But one day, he saw some bad people who wanted to harm the youth in the forest. The lion wanted to prevent them from doing so.
So, the lion roared loudly and ran towards the bad people. They were scared and ran away quickly. The youth were safe and happy again. The lion became their hero and they thanked him for preventing any harm. From that day on, the lion was loved by everyone in the forest.
