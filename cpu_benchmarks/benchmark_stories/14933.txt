Bella was a human and she liked to play with her friends. One day, when they were playing in the garden, she sneezed. Her friends laughed and said that she sounded funny. 
"Why did you sneeze?" they asked.
Bella explained that there was a thick fog in the air. The fog was making it difficult for her to breathe, so she sneezed to try and clear her nose. Her friends were amazed. None of them had ever seen such a thick fog before. 
Bella told them that she was OK and she wanted to keep playing. So the children enjoyed the rest of their day in the garden, free from the thick fog and happy that Bella was OK.
