Once upon a time there was a girl named Ann. She hung a picture on the wall. It looked so clear! Ann said, "This is mine and I like it."
Ann then went outside and hung her some strings near her house. She put a sweet on each string. Then she waited.
Soon, a big and beautiful bird landed on the string. Ann was so happy to see it. She said, "Mine!" The bird was eating the sweet and Ann was so happy.
Suddenly, another bird flew in and the first bird flew away. Ann said, "Wait, that one was mine!"
But the bird was gone. Ann smiled and said, "That was so clear, the bird was mine!" She went back to her house, hung the picture on the wall and smiled.
