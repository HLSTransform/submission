Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He loved to eat popcorn. Every day, he would ask his mom to make popcorn for him. Tim was very eager to eat popcorn all the time.
One morning, Tim woke up early. He was hungry and wanted popcorn for breakfast. He went to his mom and asked her to make popcorn. His mom said, "Okay, but we will eat it together."
So, Tim and his mom made popcorn. They sat down and ate it together. They were both very happy. And from that day on, Tim always shared his popcorn with his mom.
