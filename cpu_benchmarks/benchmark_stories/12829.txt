Max was a 3 year old wearing his favorite red shirt. He was sitting in the living room, feeling curious. He looked up at his mom and asked, "Mommy, can you stretch my hair?"
His mom smiled and replied, "Sure, let's try!" She took out a comb and a brush and started brushing Max’s hair. She brushed it carefully and gently.
Max smiled and said, "Wow, my hair looks so clean!" His mom nodded and said, "That's right. Now, let’s stretch your hair." She grabbed a hair tie and gently stretched his hair. She tied it up into a neat little ponytail.
Max beamed, "Wow my hair looks so good!" His mom laughed and said, "Well, now you have a clean and neat ponytail!"
