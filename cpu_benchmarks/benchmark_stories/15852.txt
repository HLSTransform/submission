Once upon a time, there was a funny little cat. He loved to play. Everywhere he went, he was so playful. One day he heard a ringing noise. He hopped from cloud to cloud until he noticed the ringing was coming from a big red bell.
"What is this ringing?" asked the funny little cat.
"It's a bell!" said a bird.
The funny little cat was excited. He hammered away at the bell steadily until a sweet, sweet taste filled the sky.
"Mmm, what a delicious taste!" the funny little cat said.
The bird smiled and said, "That's what happens when you play with the bell."
And ever since then, whenever the funny little cat hears a ringing noise, he hops around, ringing the bell and tasting the sweet, sweet taste it makes until his heart is filled with joy.
