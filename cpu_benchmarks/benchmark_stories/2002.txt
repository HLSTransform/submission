Once upon a time, there was a farmer. He lived far away, in a distant place. The farmer liked to stop and pause when he worked. He would rest and look around, to take in the sights.
One day, he saw something strange. It was a small, white animal with big ears. He had never seen one before! He paused and watched it, wondering what it was.
Suddenly, it started to hop away. The farmer ran after it, crossing fields and hills. He finally caught up to the animal and paused to look at it. It was a rabbit, and it hopped away again.
The farmer paused to laugh. He was happy to see the rabbit, even if it was far away. He waved goodbye, and the rabbit hopped away into the distant, green fields.
