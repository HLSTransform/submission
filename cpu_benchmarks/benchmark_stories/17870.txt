Once, Mrs. Miller had a nice bedroom. It included a bed, a desk and chair, a bookshelf and a nightstand. Everyday after work, Mrs. Miller would come home and relax in her bedroom. It was so cozy and peaceful. 
One day, Mrs. Miller decided that she wanted to make her bedroom even nicer. She went to the store and bought a whole bunch of fun things, like pillows and blankets and teddy bears. 
When she came home and put everything in her bedroom, it was really exciting. The colors were so vibrant and there were so many cool things to look at and play with. Mrs. Miller was so happy with her nice bedroom!
