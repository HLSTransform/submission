Once there was a duck. She was white and small. She liked to splash in the pond. Every day she went to the pond and splashed around. She liked to make the water move.
One day, while she was splashing, something white fell into the water. She looked closer and saw it was lots of little pieces of rice. The duck was very happy - she loved rice! She started to eat the rice and it was delicious.
The duck played in the pond for a long time, splashing and eating rice. Soon the rice was gone and she was very full.
When the duck was finished, she happily hopped out of the pond and went home. She had had a great time. Splash, splash!
