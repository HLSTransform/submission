Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved getting his hair cut by the barber. The barber was a nice man who always gave Timmy a lollipop after his haircut.
One day, a terrible storm came and destroyed the barber's shop. Timmy was so sad because he couldn't get his hair cut anymore. But the nice barber told Timmy not to worry and that he would find a new shop to cut hair in.
A few weeks later, the barber found a new shop and Timmy was so happy. He got his haircut and the barber gave him a lollipop. Timmy was so grateful to have the barber back and he knew that the terrible storm couldn't destroy their friendship.
