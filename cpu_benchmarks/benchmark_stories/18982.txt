Once upon a time, there was a big bull named Ben. Ben lived on a farm with many friends. Every day, Ben would feel very calm. He liked to eat grass and play with his friends.
One day, a small bird came to visit Ben. The bird said, "Hello, Ben! I like your calm farm. Can I play with you?" Ben smiled and said, "Yes, little bird! We can play together."
So Ben and the little bird played all day. They ran in the grass and laughed. The sun was warm and they felt happy. At the end of the day, they were tired but still felt calm. They knew they would be friends forever.
