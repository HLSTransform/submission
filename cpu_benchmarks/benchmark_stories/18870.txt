Ben likes to swim in the lake. He likes to splash and kick and see the fish. He goes to the lake with his mom and dad every day. They have a lot of fun.
One day, Ben wakes up early. He sees the sun and the birds. He wants to swim in the lake. He does not want to wait for his mom and dad. He thinks he can swim by himself. He puts on his swim suit and runs to the lake.
He jumps into the water. He feels cold and wet. He starts to swim. He sees a large shadow under the water. He thinks it is a fish. He wants to touch it. He swims closer and closer.
The shadow is not a fish. It is a crocodile. It has big teeth and a long tail. It sees Ben and opens its mouth. It bites Ben and pulls him under the water. Ben screams and cries. He is scared and hurt. He cannot swim. He cannot breathe.
His mom and dad hear him. They run to the lake. They see the crocodile and Ben. They are shocked and sad. They try to help Ben. But it is too late. Ben is gone. The crocodile swims away. Ben's mom and dad cry and hug each other. They miss Ben. They wish they had not let him go to the lake alone. They wish they had woken up with him. They wish they had stopped him. They wish they had saved him.
