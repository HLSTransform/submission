John was very upset. All day long he had wanted to ride the big mule in the pasture, but he was too scared. His dad had urged him to go up and give it a try, but John just couldn't make himself do it. He wanted to, but his fear held him back. Eventually his dad got down on one knee and put his hands on John's shoulders. He urged John to take a few steps forward, and finally John relented. He inched his way slowly toward the mule, and when he was close enough he reached out and patted its nose. The mule snorted and stepped away, but John stayed put. His dad urged him to move closer and eventually, after a few more steps, John was sitting on the mule's back! John couldn't believe he'd done it! He smiled and looked to his dad, who smiled back. John and his dad had made a great team that day, and John was no longer upset.
