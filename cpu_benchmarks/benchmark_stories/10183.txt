Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and write in her journal. Her journal was a special book where she could write about her day and draw pictures of her favorite things. One day, Lily went to the park with her friends. They played on the swings and slide, and had a lively time. 
After a while, Lily's friends had to go home. Lily wanted to finish playing on the slide, so she asked her mommy if she could stay a little longer. Her mommy said yes, but reminded her that they had to go home soon. Lily was sad that her friends had to leave, but she was happy to have more time to play. 
When it was time to go, Lily remembered to put her journal in her backpack. She wanted to write about her fun day at the park. When they got home, Lily sat down to write in her journal. She wrote about the slide, the swings, and her lively friends. She was happy to finish her story and go to bed.
