Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a nosy brother who always wanted to know what Timmy was doing. One day, Timmy got a letter in the mail from his friend inviting him to a party. Timmy was so excited to go to the party, but he didn't want his brother to come and ruin the fun.
Timmy decided to hide the letter from his brother, but his brother found it anyway. His brother was so nosy that he opened the letter and found out about the party. Timmy was very upset that his brother had ruined his surprise.
On the day of the party, Timmy's brother came with him even though he wasn't invited. He was very nosy and kept asking questions about everything. Timmy's friends didn't like his brother and they didn't want him there. Timmy was embarrassed and wished his brother had stayed home.
In the end, the party was ruined because Timmy's brother was so nosy and wouldn't leave them alone. Timmy learned that it's not nice to keep secrets from people, but it's also not nice to be nosy and ruin surprises.
