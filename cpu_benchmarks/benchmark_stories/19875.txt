Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to draw with his markers and crayons. One day, Timmy's mom gave him a new pen with black ink. Timmy was so happy!
He started to draw a picture of his dog, Spot. The pen was very good and the ink was very dark. Timmy was very careful not to get any ink on his clothes. The pen was harmless and didn't hurt Timmy at all.
Timmy's mom was proud of him and gave him a big hug. Timmy gave his mom a big smile and said, "Thank you for giving me this pen, Mommy. I love it!"
