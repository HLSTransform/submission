One day, a small boy named Tim went to play outside. It was very cold and the air was harsh. Tim liked to play in the snow. He saw a big hill and wanted to slide down it. He put on his hat, gloves, and boots and ran to the hill.
As Tim slid down the hill, he saw a bottle of shampoo. He picked it up and said, "Why is there shampoo here? It's so cold, it might freeze!" Tim thought it was funny to find shampoo in the snow.
Tim's friend, Amy, came over and asked, "What do you have there?" Tim showed her the shampoo and said, "I found it in the snow!" They laughed and played with the shampoo bottle. They pretended it was a snowman and had lots of fun.
