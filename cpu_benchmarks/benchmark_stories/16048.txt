Once upon a time there was a little girl named Susie. Susie loved animals and especially gorillas. One day Susie thought of an idea. She decided to name a gorilla "George". 
Susie went to the zoo to meet George the gorilla. Susie couldn't believe how big he was! 
"Hello George," said Susie. "Nice to meet you!"
George the gorilla looked at Susie and smiled. From that day on Susie visited George every day and made sure he was healthy. She always brought him a special snack and they played together. Susie was so happy to have a gorilla friend.
The months went by and George the gorilla got bigger and bigger. He was strong and healthy. 
One day Susie said to George, "You are my best friend. Thank you for making me so happy!"
George the gorilla hugged Susie and said, "You are my best friend too!"
