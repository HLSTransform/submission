Peter was a 3 year old boy who loved stories. He had a new storybook that he couldn't wait to read. He grabbed the book off his shelf and snuggled into his chair.
"Will you read me the story?" Peter asked his mom.
His mom smiled and said, "Sure, I'd love to." She opened the book and started reading.
Peter was so excited to hear the story. But soon, he got nervous. Peter could tell that something was wrong with the story. He grabbed his mom's arm and said, "Mom, I'm scared. Stop reading!"
His mom reassured him and said, "It's OK, Peter. Nothing is wrong. I'm here, so you don't have to be scared. I'll even put the storybook away if you want."
Peter smiled, feeling much better. "No, Mom, I want to hear the story. Please read it."
So his mom continued reading and Peter listened, no longer nervous.
