Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to go to the park to play with her friends, but her mommy said no because it was too late. Lily was sad.
The next day, Lily's mommy said they were going to a meeting. Lily didn't know what a meeting was, but she went with her mommy anyway. When they got there, Lily saw a lot of grown-ups sitting around a big table. Her mommy talked to them for a long time, and Lily got bored.
After the meeting, Lily's mommy took her to a store to buy a new toy. Lily saw a doll she really liked, but it was too expensive. Her mommy said they could only get something cheap. Lily was upset, but she found a toy she liked that was on sale.
Even though Lily didn't get to go to the park, she was happy she got a new toy. Her mommy permitted her to play with it when they got home. The end.
