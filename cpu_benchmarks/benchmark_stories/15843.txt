Once upon a time, there was a beautiful daddy and his three-year-old daughter.
One day, the daddy took his daughter to a well in the forest. It was a very big well, with a bucket inside it.
The daughter was very excited. "What is this?" she asked her daddy.
"This is a well," he told her. "A well is like a hole you can take water from."
He then asked the daughter what she wanted to take out of the well.
The daughter said she wanted to take out a shiny cloth.
The daddy lowered the bucket down into the well and ordered the bucket to bring up the shiny cloth.
Seconds later, the bucket came back up with a beautiful, shiny cloth.
The daughter was happy that she could take the cloth out of the well. She thanked her daddy and they went home, with the shiny cloth in tow.
