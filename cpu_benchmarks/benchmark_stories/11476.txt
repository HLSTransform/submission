Once upon a time, there was a tiger living in the forest. He was happy and liked playing all day long. One day, he saw an orange in a tree and wanted to help it get down. He tried jumping to get it, but it was too high.
He then saw a sour apple on the ground and wanted to help it, too. He decided to kick it up to the orange and it worked! The orange then fell down to the ground and the tiger was very happy.
But, then he saw that he had made a big mistake. The sour apple had made the orange sour, too. He was sad but he knew he could help. He kicked the sour apple away and ate another delicious, sweet apple to make him feel better. The moral of the story is to always think before you help.
