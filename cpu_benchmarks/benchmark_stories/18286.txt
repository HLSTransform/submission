Once upon a time, there was a pretty flower. It was white and it grew in a garden. One day, the flower started to bloom. It opened up and showed its petals to the sun. 
But then, a gust of wind came and blew a key into the garden. The key was shiny and silver. The flower saw the key and thought it was very interesting. 
The flower wanted to play with the key, but it couldn't move. So, it just stayed in the garden and watched the key. Eventually, the wind came again and took the key away. The flower was sad, but it was happy to have bloomed and seen the shiny key.
