Ben and Lily are friends. They like to play in the pool. The pool is big and blue. It has a slide and a ball.
One day, Ben and Lily go to the pool with their moms. They are happy. They put on their swimsuits and run to the water.
"Look, Lily, I can slide!" Ben says. He climbs up the ladder and slides down. He makes a big splash.
"Wow, Ben, you are strong!" Lily says. She claps her hands. She wants to slide too.
She goes to the ladder. But there is a boy in front of her. He is bigger than Lily. He has a mean face.
"Move, little girl!" he says. He pushes Lily. Lily falls down. She hurts her knee. She cries.
Ben sees what happens. He is angry. He runs to Lily. He helps her up.
"Are you okay, Lily?" he asks. He hugs her.
"No, Ben, he is bad!" Lily says. She points at the boy. "He pushed me!"
The boy stares at Ben and Lily. He laughs. He thinks he is funny.
Ben stares back at the boy. He does not laugh. He does not think he is funny. He thinks he is mean.
"Stop laughing, you bully!" Ben says. He throws the ball at the boy. The ball hits the boy in the face. The boy stops laughing. He starts crying.
"Ow, ow, ow!" he says. He runs to his mom.
Ben and Lily smile. They are brave. They are friends. They go back to the slide. They have fun.
