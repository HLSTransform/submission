Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ann. She loved to go on safaris. One day, her dad said they were heading off on a distant safari. Ann was so excited!
They got on the car and began their drive. On the way, Ann started to feel like something was missing…
“Dad, why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?” Ann asked.
“I don't know,” said her dad. “Maybe it will come back to you when we get there.” Ann nodded and they continued driving.
When they arrived at the safari camp, Ann remembered what it was she had forgotten - her favourite stuffed toy! She had left it on the kitchen counter. Ann started to feel sad.
“It's alright,” said Dad. “Your toy will still be there when we get back.”
But when they drove back home, Ann's toy had disappeared! She looked everywhere, but she couldn't find it.
Suddenly, Ann had an idea. She grabbed her binoculars and climbed to the top of the hill nearby. When she looked through the binoculars, she saw that her toy was in a distant field. She smiled, picked it up and ran back home with it.
The end!
