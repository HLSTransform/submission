Once upon a time, there was a nice little girl named Lily. She loved to read poems and draw pictures. One day, her mom asked her to clean up her toys, but Lily refused. She wanted to keep playing.
Later that day, Lily's friend came over to play. They had so much fun together. They played dress-up and tea party. But when it was time for Lily's friend to go home, Lily refused to say goodbye nicely. She said mean things and hurt her friend's feelings.
The next day, Lily's friend didn't want to play with her anymore. Lily felt very sad and alone. She realized that refusing to listen to her mom and being mean to her friend was not nice. She wished she could take it all back, but it was too late. From that day on, Lily learned to always listen to her mom and be kind to her friends.
