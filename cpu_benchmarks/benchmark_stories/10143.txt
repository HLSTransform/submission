Once upon a time, there was a little penguin. He was very poor and didn't have any nice clothes to wear. One day, he decided to dress up in a fancy suit. He found a bow tie and a hat and put them on. He looked very handsome!
The other penguins saw him and were very impressed. They asked him where he got his fancy clothes. The little penguin told them that he made them himself out of old scraps of fabric. The other penguins were amazed at his creativity and talent.
From that day on, the little penguin was no longer poor. He became famous for his amazing outfits and everyone wanted him to dress them up too. He was very happy and loved helping his friends look their best.
