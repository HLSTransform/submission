Once there was an old man who loved to swing. Every day he would take his grandchild to the park and they would swing together. It was lots of fun!
The old man loved to see his grandchild laugh and giggle when they were swinging. One day, the old man saw a tap on the swing set and he stopped to look at it. It was an old rusty tap that had been there for a long time.
The old man had an idea. He told his grandchild to take the tap and hang it from the swing. The grandchild was so excited. He hung the tap on the swing and they started to swing.
The tap made a beautiful sound as they were swinging. The old man and his grandchild were so happy. The old man said it was the best sound he ever heard! They laughed and sang as they swung and was the best day ever!
