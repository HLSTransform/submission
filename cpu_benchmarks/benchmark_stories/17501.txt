Lila and Ben are playing with water in the garden. They have a hose and a spray bottle. They like to spray water on the plants, the rocks and each other.
"Look, Ben, I can make a rainbow!" Lila says. She holds the hose high and sprays water in the sun. She sees the colors in the water.
"Wow, that's pretty!" Ben says. He wants to try too. He takes the spray bottle and sprays water high in the air. But he sprays too much and the water falls on his head.
"Oops, sorry, Ben!" Lila says. She laughs and helps him dry his hair.
"It's okay, Lila. It's fun!" Ben says. He smiles and sprays water on Lila.
They giggle and spray water on each other. They pretend they are in the universe, flying among the stars and planets. They have a lot of fun with water.
