Once upon a time there was a rabbit. The rabbit wanted to find a good place for a nap. It hopped and hopped until it found a long, dark tunnel. The rabbit noticed the tunnel had lots of hairy edges around it. It thought it was the perfect spot.
The rabbit scratched its way around the tunnel and started to gather sticks, leaves and grass. The rabbit carefully placed them near the tunnel entrance. The rabbit was making a cosy bed to sleep in.
When the bed was finished, the rabbit hopped inside the tunnel and settled down for a nap. The tunnel was warm and safe, perfect for snuggling down. 
The rabbit slept until it heard a friendly voice calling its name. The rabbit hopped out of the tunnel and saw its friend, a squirrel, waving at it. The two animals hugged and then hopped and skipped together in the garden, gathering treats and snacks. 
What a great day! The rabbit found a perfect place to take a nap and also found a great friend to play with.
