Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Kim. She was three years old and always loved to explore. One day, Kim was wondering in a park near her house when she heard a loud ringing sound. The sound was coming from the other side of the street. So, Kim crossed the street, carefully looking around for any wild traffic.
When she got to the other side of the street, she found an old, rusty bell hanging from a pole. She picked up the bell and began to ring it. For a few moments, the ringing sound filled the park and Kim was so excited.
Suddenly, a man walking by said, "That's a wild ringing you have there, Kim!"
Kim replied with a big smile, "I found it in the park and I really like it!" The man chuckled and replied, "Well, be careful when crossing the street and make sure to look for traffic before you go." Kim smiled and nodded her head. She thanked the man for his advice, before she ran back towards home.
