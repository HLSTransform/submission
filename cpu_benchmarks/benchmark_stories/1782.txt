Once upon a time there was a girl who loved to dive. She had never seen the ocean, but she dreamed of what it might be like.
One day, she got a chance to go to the beach. She was so excited! She ran out into the sand, and straight into the water. She felt the warm water rush over her feet and took a deep breath. Then she dived in!
The girl swam further and further until she saw a sparkling castle in the middle of the sea. She decided to explore it and inside she found a huge room filled with pizza. She took a big bite of a pizza and it was so yummy!
After that, she swam back to shore and went on her way. But she couldn't stop thinking about the charming castle. Wherever it was, she knew she would always remember it.
