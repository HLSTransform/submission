Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her phone, which was her favorite toy. One day, she went to the park with her mom and dad. While they were playing, she accidentally left her phone on a bench. When she realized it was gone, she started to cry.
Her dad asked her what was wrong, and she told him that she couldn't find her phone. Her mom suggested they look for it, but Lily was too upset. Her dad told her it was okay and that they would find it. After a few minutes of searching, they found the phone on the bench where she had left it.
Lily was so happy to have her phone back. Her dad told her that it was important to keep track of her things and to always remember to take them with her. Lily promised to be more careful in the future and to always keep her things safe. From then on, everything went back to normal and they all had a great day at the park.
