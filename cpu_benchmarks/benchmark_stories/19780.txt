One day, Tom and his best friend Sally went to the park. As they were walking around, Sally found a purple brush and showed it to Tom. Tom thought the brush was nice and said he wanted it. But Sally was teasing him and said he couldn't have it.
Tom was sad, but then he saw a bird resting in the warm sun. He pointed to the bird and said he wanted it instead. Sally teased him again and said he couldn't have that either.
Then, Tom saw a beautiful flower growing on a bush and said he wanted that instead. This time, Sally smiled and nodded her head. She handed Tom the brush and said he could take the flower.
Tom thanked his friend and took the flower and the brush. He was so happy! As he walked with Sally, he used the brush to make the flower extra soft and warm.
