Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved pastries, especially the ones with sweet jam inside. One day, she went to the bakery with her mom to buy some pastries. 
Lily saw a spicy pastry and asked her mom, "Can I have that one, please?" 
Her mom replied, "That one is too spicy for you, Lily. You won't like it." 
But Lily was determined to try it, so her mom bought it for her. She took a bite and her mouth felt hot, but she liked the taste. 
Lily said to her mom, "I gained a new favorite pastry today! Thank you for letting me try it."
