Once upon a time there was a girl named Sammy. Sammy loved to make music by playing her beautiful flute. Whenever it was her birthday, or any other special day, Sammy would serve her friends with music from her flute. Everyone would be so happy and smile when they heard Sammy play.
One day Sammy wanted to make some even more beautiful music. She asked her mom if she could serve her friends with something really special. Sammy's mom said that it was a great idea! So, Sammy practiced and practiced until she was ready to show her friends.
When Sammy's friends came to listen, everyone was amazed by the beautiful music. They had never heard anything so special before! Sammy smiled and was so happy to have served her friends in this special way. Everyone clapped and cheered when she finished. 
It was the perfect day â€“ Sammy had served her friends with beautiful music!
