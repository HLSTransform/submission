Lily and Ben like to play in the park. They see a big tunnel under a hill. They want to enter the tunnel and see what is inside.
They hold hands and walk to the tunnel. It is dark and scary. They hear noises and see shadows. Lily and Ben are afraid. They want to go back.
But then they see a light at the end of the tunnel. They walk faster and faster. They enter the light and see a surprise. It is a sunny garden with flowers and butterflies. It is warm and nice. Lily and Ben are happy. They play in the garden and forget about the tunnel.
