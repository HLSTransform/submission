Once upon a time, there was a boy named Sam. He was three years old. Sam really wanted to try new things and taste new flavors.
One day, Sam saw a weird helmet on the sidewalk. He thought it looked different from any helmet he had ever seen before. Sam decided to taste it. However, it didn't taste too great!
So, Sam decided he couldn't eat the helmet. But he did like trying new things. He started exploring around and tasted different things he found.
Sam tasted leaves, dirt and flowers. He liked most of the tastes, but he still liked some tastes better than others. The taste of dirt wasn't his favorite!
Sam learned from this experience that it's nice to taste new things, but some tastes can be weird. He was so glad he found out before he tasted the helmet again!
