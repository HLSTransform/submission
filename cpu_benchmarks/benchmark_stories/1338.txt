Once there was a hungry girl called Amy. She saw a path, so she followed it. It was a winding path that was full of exciting things to explore. Amy came across a big tree and she touched it with her hand. The bark was smooth and sharp.
Amy got hungrier and hungrier. Suddenly she saw a big, juicy strawberry growing on the tree. She climbed up the tree and picked it. It was so sweet! She enjoyed it very much and then carried on down the path.
At the end of the path, there was a big lake. Amy saw some fishes swimming in the water, so she decided to try to catch them. She went to the shore and threw in a pebble. The fishes got sharp and started to swim away. Amy was so happy to see them.
She sat by the lake with her strawberry and watched the fishes. It was a beautiful day. And best of all, she was no longer hungry.
