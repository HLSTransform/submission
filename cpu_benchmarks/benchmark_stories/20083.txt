Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy equipment, which was very special to him. His favorite toy was a rare red truck that he loved to push around the house.
One day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his toys, but he didn't want to stop playing. He decided to hide his red truck under the couch so he could keep playing with it later. But when he went back to get it, he couldn't find it anywhere.
Timmy searched and searched, but his red truck was nowhere to be found. He was very sad and felt like his day had come to a bad end. He realized that hiding his toys wasn't a good idea and promised to always put them away properly from then on.
