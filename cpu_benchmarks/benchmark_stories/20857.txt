Once upon a time there was a little girl named Emma. Every day she went outside and played until it was time to rest. One day after Emma got very tired, she asked her mom if she could go to the toilet. So they both went to the toilet, but it was empty.
"Where is the toilet, mommy?" Emma asked.
"It's empty, sweetheart. We'll need to find another one," her mom replied.
So they went outside until they found another toilet. When they got there, it was full of water. Emma was so happy! She couldn't wait to use the toilet.
After she was done, her mom gave her a big hug and said, "That was a great job, Emma! You did so well."
Emma was so proud of herself. As they walked back home, she knew that she could always find a toilet, even when the first one was empty.
