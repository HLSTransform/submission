Once upon a time, there was a brave little boy named Tommy. One day Tommy went out and walked deep into the forest. As he was walking, Tommy heard a loud growling noise. He looked around and saw a fierce bear! Tommy was scared, but he knew he had to be brave.
"Don't be scared," Tommy said to himself. He slowly stepped towards the bear. The bear saw Tommy and it jumped! But Tommy was not scared. He took out his toy gun and he shot the bear. The bear went away, and Tommy was very happy.
As Tommy started walking back home, he shouted: "I shot the fierce bear! My friends will be so proud of me!" 
When Tommy told his friends about what had happened, they were all very impressed. They said Tommy was the bravest boy they had ever seen! Tommy was so proud and happy.
