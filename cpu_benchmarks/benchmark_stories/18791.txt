Jen and Sam are friends. They like to play together. They have a big mat. They use the mat for yoga. Yoga is fun. They make shapes with their bodies. They breathe and smile.
One day, Jen and Sam have a problem. They both want the mat. Jen says, "The mat is mine. I had it first." Sam says, "No, the mat is mine. I want it now." They pull the mat. They yell. They fight.
Mom hears them. She is not happy. She comes to see them. She says, "Stop fighting. Fighting is bad. You have to share. Sharing is good. Why don't you do yoga together? Yoga is good for you. It makes you calm and strong."
Jen and Sam listen to Mom. They feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, friend." They hug. They stop fighting. They share the mat. They do yoga together. They breathe and smile. They are happy. Mom is happy too. She says, "Good job, Jen and Sam. You are good friends. I love you."
