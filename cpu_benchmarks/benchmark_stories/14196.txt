One day there was a little girl who really felt sad. She was crying. Tears ran down her face and she felt so alone.
But then she remembered something her mum had said one time. She said that when you are sad, you have to look for something to smile about.
So the little girl thought really hard. She thought about all the times she had laughed and smiled before. She thought about the things she loved doing and the people who loved her.
Finally, the little girl smiled. It was a thoughtful smile and it made her feel so much better. She was still a bit sad, but she knew that if she kept looking for things to smile about, everything would get better.
