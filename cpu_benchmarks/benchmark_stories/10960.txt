Once upon a time, there was a sleepy cat named Tom. Tom liked to dream a lot. Every day, he would find a warm spot and take a long nap.
One day, while Tom was dreaming, he saw a big red ball. It was as big as his waist! Tom wanted to play with the red ball. He tried to catch it, but the ball rolled away.
Tom chased the red ball all around in his dream. He ran and ran until he was too tired to run anymore. When Tom woke up from his dream, he felt happy. He had so much fun playing with the big red ball in his dream.
