One day, Jack decided to visit the park. He was so excited! As he walked along the path, he noticed something huge and green up ahead. It was an enormous alligator! Jack was scared, but he wanted to get closer.
He moved closer and soon he was close enough to talk to it. "Hello, Alligator!" said Jack.
The alligator replied, "Hi!" 
Jack was very surprised. He stayed and talked with the alligator for a while. They talked about the ducks and the other animals in the park. It was so much fun. 
Eventually, it was time for Jack to go home. He said goodbye to the alligator and started walking back. Jack had such an amazing day. He'll never forget the enormous alligator!
