Mia was an adventurous little girl. Everywhere she went, she would explore and find new things. One day, Mia stumbled upon a magical door. She knocked twice, and a voice from inside asked, "Who is there?" Mia timidly replied, "It's me - Mia." The voice from inside said, "We warmly accept you, Mia. Welcome to my kingdom."
Mia was so happy that she was accepted. She opened the door and was in awe of the sights before her. Everywhere she looked there were amazing things to explore. She met all kinds of creatures, some happy and some grumpy. Mia enjoyed her visit, and before she left the voice said, "Come back any time, Mia. You will always be welcome here." 
Mia thanked the voice and promised to come back soon. She waved goodbye and went on her way, feeling more adventurous than ever.
