Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a red bike with a flat tire. He wanted to ride his bike, but he couldn't because of the flat tire. Timmy's dad said he would fix it for him.
While his dad was fixing the tire, Timmy saw a bird. The bird was singing a pretty song. Timmy wanted to sing like the bird, so he tried to whistle. He tried and tried, but he couldn't whistle.
Finally, Timmy's dad finished fixing the tire. Timmy got on his bike and rode away. The wind was harsh on his face, but he was happy because he could ride his bike again. As he rode, he tried to whistle again. Maybe one day he would be able to whistle like the bird.
