Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and dolls. One day, Lily's mom asked her if she wanted to have a fancy tea party with her dolls. Lily was very excited and said yes.
Lily's mom provided all the things they needed for the tea party. She brought out the tea cups, saucers, and a fancy teapot. They sat down and enjoyed their tea and cookies.
Suddenly, Lily saw some smoke coming from the kitchen. She got scared and ran to her mom. Her mom told her not to worry and that she would take care of it. She quickly put out the fire and everything was okay.
After the tea party, Lily's mom told her that it's important to always be careful with fire and to never play with matches or lighters. Lily learned that it's important to listen to her mom and always be safe.
