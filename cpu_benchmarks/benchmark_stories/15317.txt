One day Little Tommy was playing outside. Suddenly he heard a noise and he stopped to listen. It sounded like it was coming from the nearby park. Little Tommy grabbed his mommy's hand and they went to investigate the noise together. When they arrived at the park, Little Tommy discovered that it was a group of children playing a game called hockey. Little Tommy had never seen a game like this before; it looked so wild and exciting! All the kids were shouting and running around in a big circle. Little Tommy wanted to join in too! So, his mommy joined in a game with the children and Little Tommy was allowed to play too. Little Tommy played and had so much fun that day and he even made lots of new friends. From then on, Little Tommy would go to the park every day to play hockey with his newfound friends. It was so much fun!
