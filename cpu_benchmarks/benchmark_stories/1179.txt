Once upon a time, there was a big billboard in the town. The billboard was not normal. It was very colorful and had a picture of a cat on it.
One day, a little boy named Tim went to the billboard with his mom. Tim said, "Mom, how big is the cat on the billboard?" His mom said, "Let's measure it to find out!"
Tim and his mom stood close to the billboard. They used their arms to measure how big the cat was. They found out that the cat was as big as five of Tim's arms!
Tim was very happy to know how big the cat was. He went home and told his friends about the big, colorful cat on the billboard. They all went to see it together and had a fun day.
