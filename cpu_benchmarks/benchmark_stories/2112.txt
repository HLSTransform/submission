Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her toys. One day, she found a stick and started to measure things. She measured how tall the flowers were and how wide the trees were. 
But then, it started to rain and Lily got very wet. She was miserable because she didn't like being wet. She ran back to her house and her mom gave her a warm blanket to dry off. 
Lily was happy to be inside where it was warm and cozy. She realized that sometimes it's better to be inside when it's raining outside. She hugged her mom and said, "I love you."
