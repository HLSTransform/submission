The tree was in the living room. On it was a pretty ornament. The little girl loved the ornament. One day, she was playing in the living room and she knocked into the tree. The ornament fell to the ground and broke. The little girl was very upset. She cried and screamed. Her parents told her it was okay. They said they would buy another ornament, but the little girl didn't feel better. She was still upset. The little girl never liked the new ornament. Not as much as her old one.
