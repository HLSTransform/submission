Lily and Ben were playing with their balloons in the park. They liked to blow them up and let them go. They watched the balloons fly up in the sky and make funny noises.
"Look, Lily, my balloon is red like a fire truck!" Ben said.
"Mine is yellow like a sunflower!" Lily said.
They blew up more balloons and released them. They laughed and clapped their hands.
But then, a cop came over to them. He had a blue uniform and a shiny badge. He looked serious.
"Hello, kids. Do you know what you are doing?" he asked.
Lily and Ben stopped playing. They felt scared. They did not know what they did wrong.
"We are playing with balloons, sir," Lily said.
"Balloons are fun, but they can also be dangerous," the cop said. "When you release them, they can go very far and hurt animals or people. They can also make a lot of trash and pollute the air."
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They did not think about that. They felt sorry.
"We are sorry, sir. We did not know," Ben said.
The cop smiled. He was not angry. He was thoughtful.
"It's okay, kids. You did not mean to do anything bad. But now you know better, right?" he said.
Lily and Ben nodded. They did know better.
"Can we keep our balloons, sir?" Lily asked.
"Sure, you can keep them. But don't release them anymore, okay? You can play with them in other ways. You can make shapes or animals or hats with them. Or you can give them to someone who needs a smile," the cop said.
Lily and Ben liked those ideas. They thanked the cop and gave him a hug. They decided to give some of their balloons to the other kids in the park. They made new friends and had more fun. They learned a new word and a new lesson. They were happy.
