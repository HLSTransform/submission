Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to make things with her hands. One day, she decided to make a black shirt for her teddy bear. 
Lily asked her mom, "Can we make a shirt for my teddy bear?" 
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course, let's find some black fabric." 
Lily and her mom looked through their fabric box and found a piece of black fabric. They cut the fabric, sewed it together and made a shirt for the teddy bear. 
Lily was so happy and said, "Look, teddy bear, you have a black shirt now!"
