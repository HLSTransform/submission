Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived in a small village. Her name was Jane and she was very curious. Every day, she would go outdoors and explore the world around her.
One day, while walking along a riverbank, Jane noticed a large leather bag in the mud. She picked it up and shook it, wondering what was inside. But the bag had no answer. 
So Jane decided to take the bag home with her. When she opened it up, it was filled with coins! Jane was delighted and celebrated her discovery. 
But then Jane noticed something else: the coins were scattered about carelessly in the bag. That made her question where the coins had come from.
So she put on her brave face and started making inquiries around village. On the way, she met an old man who said, "That's Frederick's leather bag! He must have been very careless with his coins."
The old man then said, "Frederick won't be happy when he finds out his bag is gone. You should give it back to him."
Jane nodded in agreement and took the bag back to Frederick. Frederick was very grateful and thanked Jane for her kindness. From then on, Jane made sure to be a bit more careful with her things.
