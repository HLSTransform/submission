Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. Jack liked to play in his yard with his dog, Spot. One day, Jack saw a bird in his yard. The bird looked hungry. Jack said, "Mommy, can we feed the bird?" 
Mommy said, "Yes, we can feed the bird." They got some bread and put it in the yard. The bird ate the bread and flew away. Jack felt happy because he was helpful to the bird. 
Spot barked and Jack said, "Spot, you are helpful too. You helped us find the bird." Spot wagged his tail and licked Jack's face. Jack laughed and played with Spot in the yard.
