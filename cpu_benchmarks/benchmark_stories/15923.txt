Once upon a time there was a little girl called Rory. She was very clever and every day she was learning new things.
One day, Rory and her mum went out shopping. Rory saw a bright orange bow and wanted it very much.
Rory’s mum smiled and said “It’s very nice, but I don’t think we should buy it today.”
But Rory said “Please Mummy, can I have it?”
Rory’s mum smiled again and said “Alright, if it will make you happy then we can buy it. I will always support you.”
Rory was so excited and hugged her mum tightly. She knew her mum always wanted to make her happy.
Rory put on the orange bow and went out to show her friends. She felt so proud!
