Once upon a time, there lived a train. It had a big, loud engine and went very fast all around the countryside. Everywhere it went, it blew a loud whistle and made a special sound.
One day, the train was going around a bend in the track when it stopped and paused. It was very quiet, and all it could hear was the sound of its engine purring. Suddenly, it smelled something very spicy. 
The train followed its nose and stopped at the next station. There, it found a man selling hot, spicy snacks. The train was so excited and the engine grew warm. It ate the spicy snacks and felt so happy. 
The train stayed there for a while, and then it went home happy and full. It looked forward to coming back to eat some more of the tasty, spicy snacks.
