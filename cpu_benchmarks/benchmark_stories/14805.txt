Lily was sick. She had a fever and a cough. She did not want to play or eat. Mommy gave her some medicine to make her feel better. But Lily did not like the medicine. It was bitter and yucky.
"Please, Lily, drink the medicine. It will help you get well," Mommy said.
"No, Mommy, no! I don't want it!" Lily cried.
Mommy looked sad. She wanted Lily to be healthy and happy. She hugged Lily and said, "I know you don't like it, but it is good for you. I love you, Lily, and I want to support you. Can you be brave and honest and try the medicine for me?"
Lily looked at Mommy. She saw that Mommy was kind and caring. She did not want to make Mommy sad. She wanted to be brave and honest, like Mommy said. She nodded and said, "Okay, Mommy, I will try it."
Mommy smiled and gave Lily a spoon of medicine. Lily made a face and swallowed it. It was still bitter and yucky, but she did not spit it out. She said, "I did it, Mommy! I drank the medicine!"
Mommy clapped and said, "Good job, Lily! You are so brave and honest! I am proud of you!" She kissed Lily and said, "Now, let's cuddle and read a story. Maybe you will feel better soon."
Lily smiled and cuddled with Mommy. She felt warm and loved. She said, "Thank you, Mommy, for supporting me. I love you, too."
