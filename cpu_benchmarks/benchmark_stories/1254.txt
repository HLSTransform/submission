Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl called Mary. Mary was so grateful for the love her family had for her.
Mary's mom and dad loved her with all their hearts. They would always tell her that no matter what happened, they would always love her.
Mary knew this love was true. She always felt it in the warmth of their hugs, and the kindness in the way they spoke to her. She was very thankful to have them in her life.
Mary wanted to share her love with them and so everyday she would do something to make them happy - like cooking them breakfast or picking flowers for the house. Her mom and dad were so proud of all the loving things she did.
Mary knew from experience that love can make the world a better place. She knew that love was the most special feeling ever and it was always worth treasuring.
