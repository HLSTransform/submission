Sammy was feeling sad. He wanted to make soup, but he did not have all of the ingredients. His mom was very thoughtful. She went to the store to get what he needed.
When his mom came back, Sammy was so happy! He spent the afternoon making soup. He wanted to make the soup perfect, so he added lots of special ingredients. 
Finally, the soup was done. But when Sammy tried to show his mom, he dropped it on the floor. He was so sad. 
But his mom said that it was ok. She was very thoughtful. She quickly put the soup back into the pot and prevented it from spilling. Sammy was so happy that he hugged his mom. They shared the soup and it was delicious!
