Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a teddy bear named Teddy. One day, Lily and Teddy went to the park to play. They had so much fun on the swings and slides.
But then, Lily started to worry. She couldn't find her favorite toy car. She looked everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found. She started to cry.
A kind lady saw Lily crying and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her about her lost toy car. The lady said, "Don't worry, we'll help you find it." They looked and looked, and finally, they found the toy car under a heavy rock.
Lily said, "Thank you so much! You helped me find my toy car. Please give me a hug!" The lady hugged her and Teddy, and Lily felt so happy. From that day on, Lily knew that if she ever needed help, she could ask someone and they would be happy to help her.
