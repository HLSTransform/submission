Sara and Ben were playing in the old house. They liked to explore the rooms and find things. They saw a big cobweb on the wall. It was white and sticky.
"Look, a cobweb!" Sara said. "It's like a spider's home."
"Can we touch it?" Ben asked.
"No, don't touch it!" Sara said. "It's dirty and icky. And maybe the spider is still there. It can bite you."
Ben did not listen. He wanted to touch the cobweb. He reached out his hand and touched it. He felt something move. He screamed.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Ben cried. "It bit me! It bit me!"
Sara ran to him. She saw a big red spot on his hand. She saw a small black spider on the cobweb. She was scared.
"Ben, are you okay?" Sara asked. "We have to go. We have to tell mom."
Ben nodded. He was in pain. He wanted to go home. He wanted his mom.
They ran out of the old house. They ran to the street. They did not see the car. The car did not see them. The car hit them. They flew in the air. They fell on the ground. They did not move. They did not breathe.
The driver got out of the car. He saw the two children. He saw the blood. He saw the cobweb on Ben's hand. He was shocked. He was sorry.
He called for help. He tried to help them. But it was too late. They were gone.
He wished he could go back in time. He wished he could stop them. He wished he could save them.
He wished they could remember to be careful. He wished they could remember to be kind. He wished they could remember to be alive.
