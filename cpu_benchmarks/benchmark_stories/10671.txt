Once upon a time, there was an elderly frog. He was content, hopping around in his pond, but he had a dream of seeing the world outside. So one day, he summoned up all his courage and hopped on shore.
"Woah! This is amazing!" he exclaimed.
"May I help you?" asked an amused voice. It was an old man, leaning on his cane.
"Yes, please! My name is Frog and I want to explore the world," he replied.
The old man smiled. "I'm sure you can, Frog. Just make sure you close the gate behind you."
Frog thanked him and hopped off happily. Everywhere he went, he remembered to close the gates. When he had seen enough, Frog hopped back to his pond, looking forward to all future adventures.
