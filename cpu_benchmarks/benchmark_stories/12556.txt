Lily liked to talk to her plant. She gave it water and sun and said nice things to it. She hoped the plant would reply, but it never did. It only grew green leaves and sometimes flowers.
One day, Lily saw a new plant in the garden. It was big and purple and had a mouth. Lily was curious and went to say hello. "Hi, plant. What is your name?" she asked.
The plant opened its mouth and said, "I am a Venus flytrap. I eat bugs and sometimes birds. Who are you?"
Lily was surprised and scared. She had never heard a plant talk before. She ran back to her house and hugged her normal plant. "You are my friend, plant. You don't eat bugs or birds. You are nice and quiet and pretty," she said.
The normal plant did not reply, but it seemed to smile. Lily felt happy and safe with her plant. She decided to stay away from the purple plant in the garden. It was too strange and scary for her.
