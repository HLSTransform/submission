Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat peanuts and would always ask her mommy to buy them for her. One day, Lily saw a little boy who didn't have any peanuts to eat. She felt sad for him and decided to share her peanuts with him. 
Lily's mommy told her that sharing is good and it makes people happy. The little boy was very happy and thanked Lily for her kindness. 
From that day on, Lily always remembered to share her peanuts with others. She learned that being open and kind to others can make a big difference in their lives.
