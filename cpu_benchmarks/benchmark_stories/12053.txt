Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her favorite toy was a teddy bear. One day, Lily was playing with her teddy bear when she saw a silly bird outside her window. The bird was flying around and making funny noises. 
Lily wanted to show the bird to her teddy bear, so she picked up her glass of milk and went to the window. She saw the bird again and showed it to her teddy bear. The bird saw Lily and her teddy bear and flew away. 
Lily was sad that the bird flew away, but she was happy that she got to see the silly bird with her teddy bear. She drank her milk from the glass and went back to playing with her toys. The end.
