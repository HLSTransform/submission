Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the world around her with her microscope. One day, she found a tiny bug and wanted to take a closer look. She put the bug under her microscope and saw its tiny legs and wings.
Suddenly, the bug started to speak to her! "Hello, little girl," it said. "Thank you for being so gentle with me." Lily was surprised but happy to hear the bug speak. She asked the bug if it wanted to be her friend.
The bug agreed and they became good friends. They would talk and explore together every day. Lily was so happy to have a new friend to share her adventures with. From that day on, she knew that anything was possible and that even the smallest things could be the most wonderful.
