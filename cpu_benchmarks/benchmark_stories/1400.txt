Once upon a time, there was a boy called Tim. He was three years old and he loved to study. One day, his mommy gave him a very special stamp. It looked sooo cool! But it was not easy to use. Tim tried to stamp the paper, but it was terrible. He stamped too hard and ripped the paper. Tim was so sad, but he wanted to try again. He was determined to study and use the stamp. Finally he did it! He was so excited. From then on, he used the stamp for all his studies. He was so proud.
