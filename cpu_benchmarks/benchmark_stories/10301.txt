Lila and Ben are twins who love to play pirates. They have a big box that they pretend is their ship, and a map that shows them where to find treasure. One day, they decide to sail to a famous island that has a lot of gold and jewels.
"Look, Ben, this is the island we need to go to," Lila says, pointing to the map. "It has a big X on it. That means treasure!"
"Wow, Lila, that looks amazing!" Ben says. "But how do we get there? We need to follow the map."
Lila looks at the map and sees that it has some pictures and words on it. She tries to read them, but they are too hard for her. She only knows some letters and sounds.
"I don't know, Ben. The map has some things I can't read. Maybe we can ask Mom or Dad to help us."
But Mom and Dad are busy in the kitchen, making lunch. They don't hear Lila and Ben calling them.
"Maybe we can figure it out ourselves," Ben says. "Let's look at the pictures. They might tell us something."
Lila and Ben look at the pictures on the map. They see a sun, a cloud, a star, a fish, and a tree. They try to match them with what they see outside the window.
"Look, Lila, there is the sun!" Ben says. "It is bright and yellow. Maybe that means we have to go to the east, where the sun rises."
"Good idea, Ben!" Lila says. "And there is the cloud! It is white and fluffy. Maybe that means we have to go to the north, where it is cold."
"Let's try it, Lila!" Ben says. "Come on, let's get in our ship and sail away!"
Lila and Ben get in their box and pretend to steer it with a stick. They make sounds like waves and wind. They imagine they are sailing to the famous island.
"Are we there yet, Lila?" Ben asks.
"I don't know, Ben. Let me check the map," Lila says.
She takes out the map and tries to fit it in the box. But the map is too big for the box. It sticks out from the sides and the corners.
"Oh no, Ben, the map doesn't fit!" Lila says.
"What do we do, Lila?" Ben says.
"I don't know, Ben. Maybe we can fold it or cut it," Lila says.
But before they can do anything, Mom and Dad come to the living room. They see Lila and Ben in their box, with the map.
"What are you two doing?" Mom asks.
"We are playing pirates, Mom," Lila says. "We are sailing to a famous island with treasure. But we have a problem. The map doesn't fit in our ship."
Mom and Dad smile. They think Lila and Ben are very cute and creative.
"That's a very nice game, Lila and Ben," Dad says. "But you don't need to worry about the map. We can help you read it and find the island. And we can also make you some sandwiches and juice for your journey. How does that sound?"
Lila and Ben are very happy. They thank Mom and Dad for their help. They are excited to continue their adventure. They hope they will find the treasure soon.
