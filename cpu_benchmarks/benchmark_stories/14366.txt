Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the backyard. One day, it rained a lot and the ground was all muddy. Lily put on her rain boots and went outside to play.
She jumped in the mud and splashed around. She enjoyed getting dirty and having fun. But after a while, she got bored. The mud was all the same color and it was dull. 
Lily realized that sometimes things that seem fun at first can become boring. She learned that it's important to try new things and not just stick to what you know. And so, she went inside to find something else to do. The end.
