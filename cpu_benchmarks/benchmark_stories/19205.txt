Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her green dress. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. Suddenly, it started to rain. 
Lily said, "Mommy, it's raining! Can we go home now?" 
Her mom replied, "No, Lily. Let's wait for the rain to stop." 
Lily was sad because she didn't want to get wet. But the rain was persistent and kept falling. 
After a while, Lily saw a rainbow in the sky. She said, "Look, Mommy! A rainbow!" 
Her mom said, "Yes, Lily. The rain made a pretty rainbow." 
Lily was happy and forgot about being wet. She played in the rain and splashed in the puddles. When they got home, Lily changed into dry clothes and told her dad all about the persistent rain and the pretty rainbow.
