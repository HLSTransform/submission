Sara loves horses. She likes to feed them carrots and brush their hair. She has a favorite horse named Brownie. Brownie is big and strong and kind. He lets Sara ride on his back and gives her gentle nuzzles.
One day, Sara and Brownie are in the field. They see a little bird on the ground. The bird has a broken wing and cannot fly. Sara feels sad for the bird. She wants to help it. She says to Brownie, "Brownie, can we take the bird to the barn? Maybe we can make it better."
Brownie nods his head. He is a compassionate horse. He cares about the bird too. He bends down and lets Sara pick up the bird. She holds it carefully in her hands. She says to the bird, "Don't worry, little bird. We will help you."
Sara and Brownie rush to the barn. They meet Farmer Joe. Farmer Joe is nice. He likes animals. He sees Sara and Brownie and the bird. He says, "What do you have there, Sara?"
Sara shows him the bird. She says, "We found this bird in the field. It has a broken wing. Can you fix it, Farmer Joe?"
Farmer Joe smiles. He says, "Of course, Sara. You and Brownie are very good friends to the bird. You are very compassionate. Let me see what I can do."
He takes the bird from Sara and puts it in a box. He wraps its wing with a bandage. He gives it some water and seeds. He says, "There you go, little bird. You will be fine. You just need some rest and care."
Sara and Brownie are happy. They thank Farmer Joe. They stay with the bird and keep it company. They hope the bird will heal soon and fly again. They are compassionate friends.
