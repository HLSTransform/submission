Lily and Sam liked to go to the park with their mom. They liked to play on the swings, slide down the slide, and run on the grass. Sometimes, they also liked to buy ice cream from the vendor. The vendor was a nice man who had a big cart with many flavors of ice cream.
One day, they went to the park and saw the vendor. They ran to him and asked for ice cream. But there was a problem. There was a big dog next to the cart. The dog was barking and growling. It did not let anyone get close to the cart. It wanted to eat all the ice cream.
The vendor was scared of the dog. He tried to shoo it away, but it did not listen. He tried to call for help, but no one heard him. He did not know what to do. The dog was preventing him from selling ice cream.
Lily and Sam were sad and impatient. They really wanted ice cream. They did not like the dog. They wished it would go away. They looked around and saw a stick. They had an idea. They picked up the stick and threw it far away. The dog saw the stick and ran after it. It forgot about the ice cream.
The vendor was happy and relieved. He thanked Lily and Sam for their help. He gave them each a big scoop of ice cream. They chose their favorite flavors. They licked their ice cream and smiled. They were glad they could prevent the dog from ruining their fun. They enjoyed their ice cream and their day at the park.
