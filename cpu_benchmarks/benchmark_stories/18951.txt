Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a dependable dog named Spot. Spot loved to help his friends. One day, Spot's friend, a little boy named Tim, lost his ball. Tim was very sad.
Spot said, "Don't worry, Tim. I will find your ball." So, Spot looked and looked for the ball. Tim watched Spot and it reminded him of the times they played together.
Spot found the ball near a big tree. But, a mean cat was there too. The cat did not want to give the ball back. Spot tried to talk to the cat. "Please, give the ball back," Spot said. But the cat did not listen.
Spot tried to take the ball from the cat, but the cat was too strong. Spot could not get the ball back. Tim was still sad. The cat took the ball and ran away. Spot and Tim could not play with the ball anymore.
