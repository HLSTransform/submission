Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to play with his toy boat in the bathtub. One day, his mom suggested they go to the lake to see some real boats. Timmy was very excited! 
When they got to the lake, they saw many boats, but one was very unusual. It was shaped like a giant duck! Timmy thought it was so funny and he laughed and laughed. 
His mom suggested they take a ride on the unusual boat. Timmy was a little scared at first, but he trusted his mom and they had a great time. They even saw some real ducks swimming in the lake! 
After their boat ride, Timmy and his mom went to have a picnic by the lake. They ate sandwiches and fruit and Timmy told his mom all about the unusual boat. It was a very fun day for Timmy and he couldn't wait to go on another adventure with his mom.
