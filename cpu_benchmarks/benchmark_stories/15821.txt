Once there was a girl named Kari. She was three years old and loved to explore new things. One day her mom bought her some yummy glue. Kari was so excited. She asked her mom: "What can I do with this glue?" Her mom smiled and said: "You can use it to stick things together!" Kari couldn't understand, so her mom said: "If you want to stick paper, use glue!" Kari suddenly understood and said: "Oh, like a sticky puzzle!" Her mom nodded and said: "Yes, like a sticky puzzle!" Kari happily started to glue the paper together and she was very proud of the finished sticky puzzle. She hugged her mom and said: "Thank you! I love my yummy glue!"
