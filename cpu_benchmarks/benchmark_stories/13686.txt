Anna liked to play with her mom's pretty things. She liked to look at the shiny rings and necklaces in the drawer. She liked to try them on and pretend she was a princess.
One day, when mom was not home, Anna opened the drawer and took out a pretty necklace. It had many colors and sparkles. Anna put it around her neck and smiled. She wanted to show it to her teddy bear.
But as she walked to her room, the necklace got caught on the door handle. Anna pulled hard, but the necklace did not come off. She pulled harder, and the necklace broke. The beads and the string separated and fell on the floor.
Anna was scared and sad. She did not want to break mom's pretty necklace. She did not know what to do. She picked up the beads and the string and ran to her room. She hid them under her bed and hoped mom would not find out.
But mom did find out. She saw the beads and the string under Anna's bed when she came home. She was angry and upset. She went to Anna and asked her what happened.
"Anna, did you take my necklace from the drawer?" mom asked.
Anna nodded. She was sorry. She did not mean to break it.
"Why did you take it, Anna? You know you are not supposed to touch my things without asking." mom said.
"I wanted to play with it. It was so pretty. I wanted to be a princess." Anna said.
"I understand, Anna, but you have to be careful with other people's things. They are not toys. They can break or get lost. And they can have special meanings. This necklace was a gift from your grandma. She gave it to me before she died. It was very important to me." mom said.
Anna felt bad. She did not know the necklace was from grandma. She loved grandma. She missed her.
"I'm sorry, mom. I did not know. I love you and grandma. Can you fix the necklace?" Anna asked.
Mom hugged Anna. She was not angry anymore. She was sad, but she also loved Anna.
"I love you too, Anna. And I miss grandma too. I don't know if I can fix the necklace, but I will try. Maybe we can do it together. And next time, if you want to play with my things, you have to ask me first. OK?" mom said.
"OK, mom. Thank you. Can I help you?" Anna said.
"Yes, you can. Come on, let's go to the drawer and see what we can do." mom said.
They went to the drawer and picked up the beads and the string. They tried to put them back together. It was hard, but it was also fun. They talked about grandma and her pretty things. They smiled and laughed. They felt closer. They did not separate.
