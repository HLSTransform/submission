One day, a little boy named Tim went to play with his friend, Sam. They wanted to play a game with a ball. The game was to see who could get the best score.
Tim threw the ball and Sam tried to catch it. Sam missed the ball and it went far away. Sam was angry. He said, "I don't like this game. I want to lie down and rest."
Tim said, "Okay, let's lie down and rest. Then we can try again to get a good score." They lay down under a big tree and looked at the sky. They saw birds flying and clouds moving.
After a while, they got up and played the game again. This time, Sam caught the ball and got a good score. Sam was happy and not angry anymore.
"Good job, Sam!" said Tim. They played the game all day and had lots of fun. They learned that sometimes it's good to take a break and try again.
