Once there was a small boy. His name was Peter. Peter was three years old. One day, he was really hungry. He knew he needed to eat something. So, he went to pick an apple from the tree in his garden. 
The apple was red and round. He grabbed it with his little hands. He was so happy to have the apple. But when he looked closely, he saw it was a bit dull. He wanted to eat a juicy apple, not a dull one. 
He decided to pick another apple. He went to the tree, and he found a bright, shiny apple. This one was much better than the dull one. He smiled and quickly grabbed it. 
Peter took a big bite. It was so delicious and juicy! He ate all of the apple until it was gone. Now he was happy and full. He had the food he needed.
