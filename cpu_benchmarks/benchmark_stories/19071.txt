Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a thumb that was very special. Her mom always said her thumb was the prettiest thing she had ever seen. But one day, Lily fell and hurt her thumb. It became very ugly and swollen. She was sad because she didn't want an ugly thumb. 
But then her mom said, "It's okay, Lily. Your thumb may be ugly now, but it will be better soon." And her mom was right! After a few days, Lily's thumb was back to normal. She was so happy that her pretty thumb was back. From that day on, she was very careful and made sure to protect her thumb so it wouldn't get hurt again.
