Once there was two friends, Willy and Sara. They were best friends. Willy and Sara lived in a small village by a river. One day they went to the river to play. 
They started to swing on a tree branch over the river. They laughed and had so much fun. As they were swinging, they could see a big fish swimming in the calm water. 
Suddenly, their swinging made them go too high and they both went into the river. The water was cold and bitter. But Willy and Sara were not scared. They laughed and splashed in the river. 
They were soon back on the bank and dried up with the warm sunlight. Willy and Sara ran back to their homes with stories to tell.
