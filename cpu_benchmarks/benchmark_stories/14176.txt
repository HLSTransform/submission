Inside the hut, Sophie saw lots of things she had never seen before. There were colorful boxes, strange shapes and funny instruments. She was so happy to learn all about these things.
Sophie spent all afternoon in her new hut, discovering new and exciting things. Whenever she had a question, she would look around and learn the answer.
