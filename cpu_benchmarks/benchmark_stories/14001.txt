Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a toy named Mr. Bear. They liked to play together every day. One day, Tim looked up and saw a big bug on the ceiling. He wanted the bug to go away, but it was too high for him to reach.
Tim had an idea. He asked Mr. Bear, "Can you help me get the bug down?" Mr. Bear, who was very useful, replied, "Yes, Tim! I will help you." So Tim put Mr. Bear on top of a chair and then climbed up too. Now, they were close to the ceiling.
With a little jump, Tim and Mr. Bear touched the bug. The bug flew away and was gone. Tim was so happy that the bug was gone. He said, "Thank you, Mr. Bear, for being so useful!" They both smiled and played together for the rest of the day.
