Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Daisy. She loved to play with her toys. One day she found an old jar in the garden. She thought it was so pretty. She happily twisted off the lid, but then made a very strange discovery.
Inside the jar, were some spoiled fruits. "Eww", she said. So Daisy decided to make the best of it and played with the jar instead. She twisted it around and around, being careful not to drop it.
Just then, Daisy's mom came by. "What are you doing with that jar, Daisy?" mom asked. "I'm just playing with it, mommy," Daisy replied. 
"It looks like fun," mom said. "But it's probably best to not play with spoiled food that you found outside. Let's put it away and do something else."
And so Daisy and her mom put the jar away and went inside. Daisy thought this was better, because now she could go and play with her other toys, and not worry about the nasty jar.
