Once upon a time, there was a foolish flea. He was always in trouble! One day, he decided he wanted to mark a big tree. He thought it would be fun.
He flew up to the tree and started to mark it with his sharp claws. But, as soon as he had started it, he heard an angry voice.
The voice said, "What are you doing?!". It was the voice of the tree. The flea was very scared. He said, "I am very sorry".
But, the tree was not happy. It said, "You have angered me. If you do not leave my tree now, I will cover you in sap and you will never be able to fly away"!
The foolish flea didn't want to get stuck in sap, so he quickly flew away and never came back. He never tried to mark a tree ever again. The end.
