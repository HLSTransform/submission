Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the season of winter because she could play in the snow. One day, Lily and her friends were playing outside when they saw a big snowman. They were so happy and started to celebrate by dancing around the snowman. 
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise coming from the sky. It was a big storm! The children were scared and ran back to their homes. Lily's mom hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we'll be safe inside." 
But the storm was too strong and it knocked down trees and power lines. Lily's house lost electricity and they had to use candles to see. Lily was sad because she couldn't play outside anymore. She asked her mom, "When will the storm go away?" Her mom replied, "I don't know, but we'll celebrate when it's over." 
Unfortunately, the storm lasted for many days and Lily's house was damaged. They had to move to a new home far away from her friends. Lily was sad because she missed her friends, but her mom said, "Don't worry, we'll make new friends and celebrate the new season."
