Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very impatient. She wanted to go outside and play, but it was raining.
The girl started looking around the house for something to do. Then, she found some old cardboard boxes. She grabbed one and closed it to make it into a fort. 
Then, she took a marker and started drawing on the cardboard. She worked hard and soon the walls were colourful and bright. 
Finally, she was so excited that she quickly closed the door and started playing in the fort. She spent the whole day inside her fort, playing with her toys and make believe. 
When it was time to go to bed, she closed the fort back up and put the cardboard boxes away. Then she had a happy smile on her face as she drifted off to sleep.
