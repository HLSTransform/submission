Once, there was a brown bear who lived in a cave near a lake. One day, he got hungry, so he decided to go out to the lake to search for food. 
On the way, he saw a rabbit, so he said "Hello! Can I eat you?" But the rabbit was scared and said, "No! Please don't eat me!" 
The bear got angry and told the rabbit, "If you don't let me eat you, I'll grab you with my big arm and take you away!" 
But then, another bear came out of the woods and put her arm around the brown bear. She said, "Maybe you can find something else to eat. Let's go look at the lake." 
The brown bear agreed, and they went off to the lake together. When they got there, they found lots of tasty fish and they both ate until they were full!
