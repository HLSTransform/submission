Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to pretend they were doctors and nurses, and they had a phone to call for help. The phone was heavy and had many buttons, but they knew how to use it.
Suddenly, they heard a loud knock on the door. They ran to see who it was. It was their grandma, who came to visit them. They were happy to see her and hugged her.
"Hello, my darlings," grandma said. "I have a surprise for you. Do you want to see it?"
"Yes, yes, yes!" Tom and Lily said.
Grandma opened her big bag and took out a small box. She gave it to Tom and Lily. They opened it and saw a shiny new phone. It was light and had a screen and many colors.
"Wow, thank you, grandma!" Tom and Lily said. "This is the best phone ever!"
They wanted to play with the new phone right away. But they had a problem. They both wanted to hold it and press the buttons. They started to fight over it.
"Give it to me, it's mine!" Tom said.
"No, it's mine, I saw it first!" Lily said.
They pulled and pushed and shouted. The phone slipped from their hands and fell on the floor. It broke into pieces. They were shocked and sad.
"Oh no, what have we done?" Tom said.
"We broke the phone, grandma will be mad!" Lily said.
They looked at grandma, who was watching them. She was not mad. She was sad.
"I'm sorry, grandma," Tom and Lily said. "We were bad. We didn't share the phone. We broke your surprise."
Grandma hugged them and said, "It's okay, my darlings. I'm not mad. I'm sad because you fought over a thing. Things are not important. Love is important. You are important. You are my surprise. Can you share your love with each other?"
Tom and Lily nodded and said, "Yes, grandma. We love you. We love each other. We're sorry."
They hugged grandma and each other. They felt better. They didn't need the phone to play. They had each other. They were happy.
