Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had an attractive toy car that she loved to play with. It was shiny and red. Lucy liked to drive it around her room and make it go very fast.
One day, Lucy's friend, Tim, came over to play. He saw the attractive toy car and wanted to play with it too. Lucy thought about it and decided to share her toy car with Tim. They took turns driving the car around the room, making it go fast and having lots of fun together.
While they were playing, the toy car had a little wreck. It hit the wall and lost a wheel. Lucy and Tim were sad, but they worked together to fix the car. They found a new wheel and put it on the car. It was as good as new!
Lucy said, "I'm glad we shared my car, even though it had a wreck. We fixed it together and had fun!" Tim agreed and said, "Sharing is fun, and it's good to help each other when things go wrong."
The moral of the story is that sharing is a good thing to do, and it's important to help each other when things go wrong.
