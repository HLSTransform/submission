Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Sarah. She was so bossy that no one wanted to play with her. One day, Sarah was feeling lonely and sad. She went to her mom for help.
"Mom, what can I do to find a friend?" Sarah asked with hope in her voice.
"Well, why don't you make some cocoa?" her mom suggested.
Sarah got to work and was soon spreading rich, dark cocoa all over the kitchen. She invited all the children from her neighbourhood to enjoy her cocoa and slowly, one by one, the kids started joining her. Pretty soon, Sarah had many new friends and everyone loved her cocoa.
The story of Sarah and her cocoa spread through the neighbourhood and soon everyone know that by being kind and generous, Sarah had made lots of friends. 
This teaches us that being bossy is not the way to win a friend. Instead, we can make friends by spreading joy and kindness, like Sarah did with her cocoa!
