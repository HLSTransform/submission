Once upon a time, in a big universe, there was a high mountain. On top of the mountain, lived a kind bird named Wipe. Wipe loved to fly high in the sky and look at the universe.
One day, Wipe saw a little girl crying at the bottom of the high mountain. He wanted to help. So, Wipe flew down and asked the girl, "Why are you sad?" The girl said, "I lost my toy. Can you help me find it?" Wipe nodded and they started to look for the toy together.
After some time, Wipe found the toy behind a big rock. The little girl was so happy. She hugged Wipe and said, "Thank you for helping me!" Wipe felt happy too. From that day on, they became best friends and played together in the big universe under the high mountain.
