Once upon a time there was a small hill near a family house. A family of four lived near the hill. Mom and Dad had a daughter and a son. One day, they all went outside and decided to teach their children to climb the small hill.
First, Mom and Dad said to their son and daughter, “Look at the small hill. It’s very easy to climb. Let’s try it!”
The kids were excited to try it. Mom and Dad showed them how to put their feet on the hill and walk up. They also taught them how to be careful and use their hands and feet to help them stay balanced.
The two kids tried hard, but they were just too small. They needed more practice. So they kept trying. Little by little they learned how to climb the hill. Finally, they both made it to the top.
They were so proud! They hugged their parents and celebrated their success. From that day on, they loved climbing the small hill and showed everyone what they had learned.
