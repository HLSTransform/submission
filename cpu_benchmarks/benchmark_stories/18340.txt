Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was a useful dog. He loved to help his family. One day, Spot's family set a big box in the yard. Spot did not know what was in the box. But he was very excited.
In the evening, Spot's family opened the box. Spot saw a big, red ball. He knew this ball was for him. Spot's family had been talking about a surprise for him, and now it was here. Spot was so happy.
Spot played with the big, red ball all day. He would run and jump and catch the ball. The ball was the best toy Spot ever had. The big box had been a clue for the fun that was coming. Spot was a very happy and useful dog.
