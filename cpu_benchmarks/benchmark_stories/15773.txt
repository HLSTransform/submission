Once upon a time there was a pit. It seemed like a big hole in the ground.
One day, two children saw the pit. They were both very silly and started to giggle. They decided to jump in the pit and asked each other:
"Do you want to jump in?"
"Yes!"
The children jumped in and felt like they were falling forever. But in the end, they finally landed in a soft pile of sand.
"That was fun," one of the children said with a chuckle.
The other said: "Let's do it again!"
So they did, and it seemed like a silly, never-ending adventure.
