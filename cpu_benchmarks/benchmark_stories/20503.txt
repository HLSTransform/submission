Once upon a time there were two brothers. One was called Joe and one was called Jack. 
One day, a tornado spread across the land. It was very fast and tough for Joe and Jack. 
Joe and Jack were scared, but they were also brave. The brothers worked together to look after each other. They held each other's hands as the tornado spread all around them.
Pretty soon, the tough tornado had gone away. Joe and Jack realized they had been brave and strong together. 
The brothers hugged each other with joy. Then they smiled and said, " We did it! We beat the tornado together!"
