Once upon a time, there was a silly goose named Gigi. Gigi was very crazy and loved to perform for her friends. She would dance and sing and make everyone laugh. 
One day, Gigi decided to go on an adventure. She wanted to explore the big, wide world outside of her farm. She waddled and quacked her way through the fields until she reached a pond. 
There, she met some new goose friends who were also very silly. They performed a silly dance together and had a lot of fun. Gigi realized that she didn't have to be alone to perform and have fun. She could make new friends and have adventures with them too.
