Sam and Jen were best friends. They liked to play together every day. They had a special place in the park, where they could hide and make up stories. They called it their secret place.
One day, Sam's mom told him they had to move to a new place. Sam was very sad. He did not want to leave Jen and their secret place. He did not want to go to a new place where he did not know anyone. He wanted to stay with Jen forever.
He told Jen the bad news. Jen was very sad too. She did not want to separate from Sam. She did not want to lose her best friend. She wanted to play with Sam every day. She gave Sam a big hug and a picture she drew of them.
Sam and Jen said goodbye. They cried a lot. They promised to write to each other and to remember their secret place. Sam got in the car with his mom and dad. He looked out the window and waved to Jen. Jen waved back and watched the car drive away.
Sam and Jen never saw each other again. They moved to different places and made new friends. They forgot to write to each other and to remember their secret place. They grew up and lived ordinary lives. They did not know that they had lost something very special. They did not know that they had lost each other.
