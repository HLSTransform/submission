One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. They took a big, cheap blanket with them. When they got there, Tim saw a butterfly. "Look, Mom! A butterfly!" he said.
"Let's catch it!" said his mom. They ran after the butterfly, trying to catch it with their hands. But the butterfly was too fast. Tim and his mom laughed as they chased it around the park.
After a while, they got tired and sat down on the cheap blanket. Tim's mom had an idea. "Why don't we use the blanket to catch the butterfly?" she asked. Tim thought it was a great idea. They held the blanket in the air and waited for the butterfly to come near.
When the butterfly flew close, they quickly moved the blanket and caught it! Tim and his mom looked at the beautiful butterfly. "Wow, it's so pretty!" Tim said. They let the butterfly go and watched it fly away. It was a fun day at the park with the cheap blanket.
