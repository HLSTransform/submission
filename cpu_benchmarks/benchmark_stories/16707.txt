Ben and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. Ben had a big truck that made loud noises and had shiny lights. Lily had a doll that could talk and sing. Lily liked her doll, but she also wanted to play with Ben's truck. She was envious of Ben's truck.
"Can I play with your truck, Ben?" Lily asked.
"No, it's mine. You have your doll," Ben said.
"But I want to try your truck. It looks fun," Lily said.
"No, go away. Leave me alone," Ben said.
Lily was sad and angry. She saw Ben's wallet on the table. Ben had some money in his wallet that he got from his grandma. Lily had an idea. She took Ben's wallet and ran to her room. She locked the door and opened the wallet. She saw some coins and a bill. She smiled and put them in her piggy bank.
Ben heard Lily run to her room. He saw his wallet was gone. He knew Lily took it. He was furious. He ran to Lily's door and banged on it.
"Lily, give me back my wallet! That's not yours!" Ben shouted.
"Go away, Ben. Leave me alone. I have your money now," Lily shouted back.
Ben tried to open the door, but it was locked. He cried and screamed. He wanted his wallet back. He wanted his money back. He wanted his truck back. He was very unhappy.
