Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved chocolate more than anything in the world. One day, her mommy let her have a big piece of chocolate. It was mighty delicious!
But then, Lily started feeling a little funny. Her tummy started hurting and she felt sick. Her mommy told her that too much chocolate can make you feel sick. 
From that day on, Lily learned that she should only have a little bit of chocolate at a time. She still loved it, but she was careful not to eat too much. And every time she had a little bit, she remembered how mighty delicious it was, but also how important it was to not eat too much.
