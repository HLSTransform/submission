Once upon a time, there was a little bird who loved to sing. She lived in a big tree with many branches. One day, she met a big bird who told her she had a terrible voice. The little bird felt sad and stopped singing.
But then, she remembered something her mother told her. She said, "Listen to your heart and never give up on what you love." So, the little bird listened to her heart and started singing again. She sang louder and more beautifully than ever before.
The big bird heard her and was amazed. He said, "I was wrong. Your voice is not terrible, it's wonderful!" The little bird smiled and continued to sing, happy that she listened to her heart and didn't give up on her passion. The moral of the story is to always believe in yourself and never let anyone bring you down.
