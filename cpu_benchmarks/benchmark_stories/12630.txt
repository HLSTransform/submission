Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to go on adventures with his friends. One day, they found a weird map that showed them where to go to find treasure. They followed the map and went through a big forest. 
As they walked, they saw a river that was part of the map. They crossed it and found a cave. Inside the cave, they found a chest full of gold coins! They were so happy and excited. They decided to share the treasure and part it equally among themselves.
From that day on, Timmy and his friends went on many more adventures, using the weird map to guide them. They always had fun together and never forgot the day they found the treasure.
