Lily was very enthusiastic about going to the park with her mom. She loved to play on the swings, the slide and the sandbox. She put on her pink hat, her blue coat and her yellow boots. She ran to the door and waited for her mom.
"Mom, mom, hurry up! Let's go to the park!" she shouted.
"Okay, okay, Lily, calm down. We have to eat breakfast first. And don't forget your backpack. You need to bring some snacks and water," her mom said.
Lily did not want to eat breakfast. She did not want to bring her backpack. She just wanted to go to the park. She was impatient and angry. She threw her spoon on the floor and kicked her backpack.
"Mom, I don't want to eat! I don't want to bring my backpack! I want to go to the park now!" she screamed.
"Lily, stop that! You are being very rude and naughty. You have to eat something and you have to carry your backpack. It's not that heavy. If you don't behave, we won't go to the park at all," her mom warned.
Lily did not listen to her mom. She kept crying and throwing things. She made a big mess in the kitchen. Her mom was very upset and disappointed. She decided to cancel the trip to the park.
"Lily, that's it. We are not going to the park today. You have to stay in your room and think about what you did. Maybe you will learn to be more polite and grateful next time," her mom said.
She took Lily to her room and closed the door. Lily was very sad and angry. She regretted being so mean and stubborn. She wished she had listened to her mom and eaten her breakfast and brought her backpack. She missed the park and the fun. She lay on her bed and cried. She did not have a good day. She did not have a good wake. She had a bad ending.
