Once there was a bird who wanted to soar high in the sky. She loved the sunny days and longed to feel the warmth of the sun on her wings. Every day she would flap her wings and hop around, dreaming of one day being able to pull off the biggest trick of them all.
One warm and sunny day, she jumped in the air and something inside of her clicked into place. She closed her eyes and lifted off the ground. Suddenly she felt the sun and the wind on her wings and knew that her dream had come true. She was soaring!
The bird flew far and wide, feeling the wind push against her wings. She laughed with joy because nothing felt better than to be able to soar. Each time the weather changed, so did her route. Sometimes it was too windy and she couldn't go as fast, but other days the weather was perfect and she soared as high as she could.
It felt so important to the bird to keep soaring, even when the weather wasn't great. And every time she was back in the sky, she felt like she was home.
