John was so excited to go out and play in the rain. He grabbed his red raincoat and ran to the door. As he opened it, the rain was falling from the sky, splashing in big puddles all over the ground.
John laughed as he jumped into the biggest puddle. He splashed around, feeling the wet soil on his shoes. He loved the feeling of the cold rain running down his face.
John looked up at the sky and saw a rainbow. He gasped in excitement as he watched the weak colours dance in the sky.
John smiled and continued to play in the rain until it was time to go in. Even though he was wet and cold, John was still excited to be outside.
