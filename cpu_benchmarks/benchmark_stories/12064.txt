Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a big dog named Max. Max was very hungry and Timmy wanted to feed him. Timmy went to the store to buy some dog food. The store owner said the price was high, but Timmy wanted to make sure Max had good food. 
When Timmy got home, Max was very happy to see the food. Timmy opened the bag and gave Max some food. Max loved it! Timmy was happy to see Max eat. 
Timmy's mom came in and asked, "Did you buy the original dog food?" Timmy said, "Yes, I did. Max likes it a lot." His mom smiled and said, "Good job, Timmy. You are a great dog owner."
