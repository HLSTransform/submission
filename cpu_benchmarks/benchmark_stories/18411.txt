Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily's mom asked her to help her fold the pillows on the couch. Lily was excited to help and started to fold the pillows one by one. 
After a while, Lily's mom came back and saw that Lily was doing a successful job. "Wow, Lily! You are doing such a great job folding those pillows!" said her mom. 
Lily smiled and replied, "Thank you, Mommy! I like helping you." 
Her mom hugged her and said, "I love when we work together. You are my best helper." 
Lily felt happy and proud of herself for being a successful helper. She continued to fold the pillows with her mom and they had a great time together.
