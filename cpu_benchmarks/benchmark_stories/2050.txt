Once upon a time, there was a monkey who lived in the jungle. One day, the monkey got confused and lost his way. He climbed up a tall tree to try and see where he was, but he still couldn't figure it out. Suddenly, he saw a bird flying by with a banana in its beak. The monkey knew that the bird must have come from the direction of the banana trees. So, he decided to follow the bird and see where it would lead him. 
After a while, the bird landed on a branch and the banana fell to the ground. The monkey quickly ran over and grabbed the banana. As he was eating it, he heard a loud noise. It was a hunter who had been tracking the monkey. The monkey knew he had to escape, so he quickly climbed up a nearby tree. The hunter tried to catch him, but the monkey was too quick. He used his strong arms to release himself from the hunter's grasp and ran away back into the jungle.
