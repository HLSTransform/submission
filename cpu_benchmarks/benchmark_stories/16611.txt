Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play with toys and books. One day, they found a new book in the library. It had many pictures and words. Lily said, "This book looks interesting. What is its name?"
Ben looked at the cover and read, "The Magic Juice". He said, "Let's read it. Maybe it has a fun story."
They opened the book and saw a big bottle of juice on the first page. The juice was red and sparkly. It had a label that said, "Drink me and you will see wonders". Lily and Ben were curious. They wanted to see wonders. They looked around and saw no one. They decided to try the juice.
They each took a sip from the bottle. It tasted sweet and sour. They felt a tingling in their mouths. They waited for something to happen. But nothing happened. They felt disappointed. They said, "This juice is not magic. It is boring."
They turned the page and saw a big warning. It said, "Do not drink the juice. It is poison. It will make you sick and sleepy. It will make you forget everything. It is too late to stop it. Goodbye." Lily and Ben felt scared. They felt their heads hurt and their eyes close. They tried to call for help, but no one heard them. They fell asleep on the floor. They never woke up. The book was not interesting. It was evil. The end.
