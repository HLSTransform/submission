Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a very tidy room. One day, Tim's mom told him not to go into the kitchen. She said, "I warn you, Tim, do not go in the kitchen today."
Tim was a curious boy. He wanted to see what was in the kitchen. He thought, "I will just take a little look." So, when his mom was not looking, Tim went into the kitchen.
In the kitchen, Tim saw a big pot on the stove. It was hot and steamy. Tim wanted to see what was inside the pot. He climbed up on a chair, but he slipped and fell. The hot pot fell too. Tim was hurt and cried. His mom came running and was sad. She wished Tim had listened to her warning.
