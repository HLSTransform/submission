Once upon a time, there was a kind and gentle queen. Her kingdom was big and colourful and all the people were so happy. The queen had one wish - to be able to speed around the kingdom quickly, seeing all the wonderful sights it offered.
One day, the queen decided to make her dream come true. She put on her special dress and her biggest, most sparkly crown, and set off in her horse-pulled carriage. But soon the carriage became very messy! Her beautiful dress was covered in mud, and her pretty crown was rolling everywhere.
The queen told her horses to speed up, and they galloped as fast as they could. As they galloped around the kingdom, the queen saw so many beautiful sights. She laughed, smiled and waved as the people cheered and clapped. The queen had a wonderful time and admired the kingdom's beauty.
When they got back to the palace, the queen thanked the horses and was so glad she had made her dream come true. From then on, the queen promised to always make time to explore her kingdom and its beautiful sights.
