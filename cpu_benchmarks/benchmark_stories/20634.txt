Once there were two friends: a thoughtful pipe and a wise rabbit. They would often sit in the garden together and play every day. 
One day, the rabbit noticed something strange: the pipe was separated from the garden! The rabbit asked why and the pipe said that it was because it wanted to explore the world outside.
The rabbit thought this was a very thoughtful idea and offered to help the pipe find its way. So, the two set off on their journey together. 
They travelled to different places, saw different things and eventually, they separated. The pipe went one way while the rabbit went another. 
But even in parting, they knew they would always be friends forever.
