Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play baseball in the park. They have a bat, a ball and a glove. They take turns to hit and catch.
One day, Tim and Sam go to the park to play baseball. But they see a big dog on the grass. The dog has their ball in his mouth. He runs around and shakes his head. He does not want to give the ball back.
"Hey, dog, that is our ball!" Tim shouts. He tries to get the ball from the dog. But the dog is too fast and too strong. He barks and runs away.
Sam is frustrated. He does not like the dog. He wants to play baseball. He says to Tim, "What can we do? How can we get our ball back?"
Tim thinks for a moment. He has an idea. He says to Sam, "I know. Let's get a stick. Maybe the dog likes sticks more than balls. We can throw the stick and make the dog chase it. Then we can get our ball back."
Sam likes Tim's idea. He says, "OK, let's try it." They look for a stick in the park. They find a big one. They throw the stick to the dog. The dog sees the stick. He drops the ball and runs after the stick. He catches the stick and wags his tail.
Tim and Sam are happy. They run to the ball and pick it up. They say, "Yay, we have our ball back!" They thank the dog and wave to him. The dog wags his tail again. He likes the stick.
Tim and Sam go back to their spot. They play baseball again. They have fun. They are friends.
