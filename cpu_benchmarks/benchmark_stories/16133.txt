Once upon a time in the nearest village, there lived a youth who was very fragile. He walked around proudly, bowing his head to all he met. One day, a villager asked him why he was always bowing and wondered if it was due to his fragility. 
The youth hesitated, but eventually answered: "I am bowing because I want to show respect and honour for all. I want to demonstrate kindness and humility for those who I meet and interact with". 
The villager, who was very wise, smiled and nodded his head. He said to the youth: "Your bowing is an ordinary act, but it brings extraordinary joy". The villager waved goodbye to the youth, and the youth, with a smile on his face, bowed goodbye to the villager.
