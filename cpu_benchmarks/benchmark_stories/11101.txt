Once upon a time, there was a little blue pony. The pony lived on a farm with big animals and small animals. The pony was happy and liked to play with its friends.
One day, the blue pony saw a big horse jump over a fence. The pony wanted to learn how to jump too. So, the big horse helped the blue pony practice jumping every day.
After a while, the blue pony learned to jump very high. All the animals on the farm were so proud of the pony. The blue pony was happy it learned something new and had fun with its friends.
