Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was feeling grumpy because he wanted a toy that he saw in the store, but his mom said no. 
Suddenly, there was an emergency! Timmy's mom got a phone call and had to leave right away. Timmy was scared, but he knew he had to be brave. 
He wanted to help his mom, so he grabbed his favorite stuffed animal and followed her out the door. Timmy's mom was so proud of him for being such a good helper during the emergency. And when they got back home, she surprised him with the toy he wanted as a reward for being so brave.
