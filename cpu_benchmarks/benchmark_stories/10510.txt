Once upon a time, there was a great storm. The wind was very loud and the rain was coming down hard. Susan was a little scared but she had a Mom who loved her.
Mom said, "Let's go outside, Susan. I want to show you something." So, Susan followed her Mom outside to watch the storm. They saw lightning and heard thunder. Then, Mom wiped the rain off of Susan's face with a cloth. Susan felt a little better and smiled.
Susan and her Mom stayed outside until the storm was over. The sky cleared and the sun began to shine. It was a great day! Susan was so happy that she gave her Mom a big hug and said, "Thank you for wiping my tears away." Her Mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, sweetheart."
