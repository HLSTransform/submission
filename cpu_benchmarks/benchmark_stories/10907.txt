Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the store with her mommy to buy some cards for her friends. Lily saw a big box of ice cream and wanted some. She asked her mommy if she could have some ice cream, but her mommy said no because it was too cold outside. 
Lily was sad, but she remembered that her mommy always said that it's important to listen to your parents. She knew that her mommy was ordering her to not eat the ice cream because it wasn't good for her. So, she didn't argue and instead helped her mommy pick out some pretty cards for her friends. 
When they got home, Lily's mommy was proud of her for listening and not throwing a tantrum. She rewarded Lily with a warm cup of hot cocoa to help her warm up. Lily learned that sometimes it's important to follow orders and not always get what you want.
