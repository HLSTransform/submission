Once upon a time, there was a little frog who lived in a pond. He was always grumpy because he didn't like to share his lily pad with other frogs. One day, he decided to peek over the edge of the pond and see what was happening outside. 
As he peeked over, he saw a family of ducks swimming by. They looked like they were having so much fun! The little frog started to feel a little less grumpy as he watched them play. 
The next day, the little frog decided to leave his lily pad and explore the pond. He met some new frog friends and they played together all day. The little frog was so happy that he forgot all about being grumpy. From that day on, he always made sure to peek out of the pond and see what adventures awaited him. The end.
