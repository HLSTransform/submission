Once upon a time there was a little girl called Molly. She was sweet and kind, and she loved to read. Every day, she would sit with her book and read. 
One day, Molly went to the park to play. She noticed a stream running through the grass and she was so excited. She went over to explore. The stream was thick and clear. Molly decided to take her book and read by the stream. 
She opened her book and started to read. Suddenly, she heard a voice. She looked up and saw a frog by the side of the stream. The frog said, "Hi Molly, why don't you come and join me in the stream?"
Molly was so surprised. She thought for a moment and smiled. She put down her book, took off her shoes and climbed in the stream. As Molly read, the frog hopped around and listened. The two were happy as they both read and enjoyed the stream.
