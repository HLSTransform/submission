Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and blocks. One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big slide and a swing. They want to try them.
"Let's go to the slide first," Tom says. "I want to go fast."
"OK," Sam says. "But I want to go to the swing later."
They run to the slide. There are many kids there. They have to wait for their turn. Tom and Sam are not happy. They want to slide now.
"Look, there is a number on the slide," Tom says. He points to a sign. It says "4".
"What does it mean?" Sam asks.
"It means only four kids can slide at a time," Tom says. "We have to count."
They start to count the kids on the slide. One, two, three, four. Then one kid slides down. Now there are three.
"Quick, let's go!" Tom says. He pushes Sam to the slide. He follows him.
But the other kids are not happy. They say Tom and Sam are not fair. They did not wait for their turn. They start to yell and cry.
"Hey, you can't do that!" one kid says. "You have to go back!"
"No, we don't!" Tom says. "We want to slide!"
The kid gets angry. He runs to the slide. He tries to pull Tom and Sam off. He pushes them hard.
Tom and Sam lose their balance. They fall off the slide. They hit the ground. They hurt their heads and knees. They start to cry too.
Their moms hear the noise. They run to the slide. They see Tom and Sam on the ground. They see the other kids on the slide. They are not happy.
"What happened?" Tom's mom asks.
"They pushed us!" the kid says. "They did not wait for their turn!"
"Is that true?" Sam's mom asks.
Tom and Sam do not answer. They know they did something bad. They are sorry.
Their moms pick them up. They check their wounds. They are not serious, but they are rare. They need some bandages and kisses.
"Let's go home," Tom's mom says. "You need to rest and learn to share."
Tom and Sam nod. They do not want to play anymore. They do not want to slide or swing. They are sad and ashamed.
They say sorry to the other kids. They say sorry to their moms. They hold their hands. They walk to the car.
They sit on their seats. They are quiet. They look out the window. They see the park. They see the slide and the swing. They wish they had been nice. They wish they had waited for their turn. They wish they had had fun.
