Once upon a time, there was a little fishy named Nemo. Nemo loved to swim in the big ocean with his fishy friends. One day, Nemo got tired and wanted to rest. He found a cozy spot near some seaweed where he felt comfortable. 
Suddenly, Nemo smelled something yummy coming from the other side of the ocean. He wanted to see what it was, so he swam over to investigate. When he got there, he saw his friend Dory stirring a big pot of fish soup! 
Nemo was so excited to try the soup, but he didn't want to leave his comfortable spot. Dory understood and brought a bowl of soup over to him. Nemo slurped up the soup and felt so happy and comfortable. He thanked Dory for being such a good friend and for making the delicious soup.
