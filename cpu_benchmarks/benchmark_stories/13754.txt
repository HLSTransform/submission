Anna likes to play with her aunt. Her aunt has many toys and books and games. Anna likes to make puzzles with her aunt. They have a big puzzle with many pieces. It is a picture of a farm with animals and trees.
"Anna, do you want to finish the puzzle with me?" her aunt asks. "We only have a few pieces left."
"Yes, yes, I want to finish!" Anna says. She runs to the table and looks for the pieces. She finds a piece with a cow and puts it in the right place. She finds another piece with a duck and puts it next to the cow.
"Good job, Anna, you are very smart!" her aunt says. She smiles and hugs Anna. "Now, let's find the last piece. It has a barn on it. Do you see it?"
Anna looks around the table. She does not see the piece. She looks under the table. She does not see the piece. She looks behind the sofa. She does not see the piece. She feels sad. She wants to finish the puzzle.
"Where is the piece, aunt?" she asks. "I can't find it."
Her aunt looks around too. She does not see the piece. She thinks for a moment. She remembers something. She feels scared.
"Oh no, Anna, I think I know where the piece is," she says. "Do you remember when we went to the kitchen to get some juice?"
"Yes, I remember," Anna says.
"Do you remember what you did with the piece you had in your hand?"
Anna thinks for a moment. She remembers something. She feels bad.
"I... I put it in the trash," she says. "I thought it was a paper."
Her aunt gasps. She runs to the kitchen. She opens the trash can. She sees many things inside. She sees banana peels and egg shells and napkins and cans. She does not see the piece.
"Oh no, Anna, the piece is gone," she says. "The trash man came and took it away. We can't finish the puzzle now."
Anna cries. She feels sorry. She wants to say sorry to her aunt. She wants to hug her aunt. But her aunt is angry. She does not hug Anna. She does not say anything. She walks away. She leaves Anna alone. Anna feels very sad. She wishes she did not put the piece in the trash. She wishes she could finish the puzzle with her aunt. She wishes her aunt would love her again.
