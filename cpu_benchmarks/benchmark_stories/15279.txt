Once upon a time there was a nice little boy. He loved to play in the garden with his friends. One day he found an old mop in the corner. He looked at it and wanted to hug it. So he grabbed it in his arms and hugged it tight. But when he hugged it, he felt something wet. He looked and saw that the mop was filled with water. He was so excited and laughed out loud. He ran inside and found a bucket to fill with water and started to mop the floor. Every time he was finished, he gave the mop a hug. He was so proud of himself and his mop. Every day he would hug and mop the floor, and soon his mommy and daddy saw how nice the floor was and hugged him too!
