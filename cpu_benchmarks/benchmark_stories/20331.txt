Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with round things. They have a ball, a hoop, and a wheel. They roll them, throw them, and spin them. They have fun.
One day, they see a big round thing in the park. It is shiny and red. It has a handle on top. They want to play with it. They run to it.
"Wow, what is this?" Tom asks.
"I don't know, but it looks fun. Let's lift it and see what it does," Mia says.
They try to lift it, but it is too heavy. They pull and push, but it does not move. They get tired and sad.
"Maybe we need help," Tom says.
"Maybe we can ask someone," Mia says.
They look around and see a friendly man. He is wearing a blue suit and a hat. He has a badge on his chest. He is walking towards them.
"Hello, kids. What are you doing?" he asks.
"We want to play with this round thing, but we can't lift it. Can you help us?" Tom asks.
The man smiles and shakes his head. He says, "I'm sorry, kids, but this is not a toy. This is a fire hydrant. It is for putting out fires. You can't play with it. It is dangerous."
"Dangerous? Why?" Mia asks.
"Because it has water inside. A lot of water. If you lift the handle, the water will come out very fast and very strong. It can hurt you and make a big mess. You don't want that, do you?" the man says.
Tom and Mia shake their heads. They say, "No, we don't."
The man says, "That's good. Now, why don't you go and play with your other round things? They are safer and more fun. And remember, never touch a fire hydrant, okay?"
Tom and Mia nod. They say, "Okay. Thank you, mister."
They run back to their ball, their hoop, and their wheel. They play with them and forget about the fire hydrant. They have fun.
