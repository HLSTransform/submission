Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia was scared of the dark. Every night, she would sleep with her teddy bear, Mr. Snuggles. Mr. Snuggles made her feel safe.
One day, Mia found a big book with many pages. She opened the book and found a story about a brave girl. Mia read the story aloud to Mr. Snuggles. "Look, Mr. Snuggles, the girl is not scared!" said Mia. Mr. Snuggles just smiled at her.
As Mia turned the page, she felt a pinch on her finger. "Ouch!" she cried. Mia looked at her finger and saw a tiny paper cut. She was scared at first, but then she remembered the brave girl in the story. Mia took a deep breath and said, "I will be brave like the girl in the story." She hugged Mr. Snuggles and felt better. From that day on, Mia was not scared of the dark anymore.
