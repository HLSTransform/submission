Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his ball in the park. One day, he saw a big boy who wanted to take his ball. Timmy said, "No, it's mine!" and the big boy said, "I want it!" They started to fight and kick each other.
Suddenly, an old man came and said, "What's going on here?" Timmy said, "He wants my ball!" The old man said, "Let's share it. You can play together." The big boy said, "Okay, that's original." They played together and had fun.
But then, the big boy kicked the ball too hard and it went into the street. A car hit the ball and the ball broke. Timmy started to cry and the big boy said, "Sorry." The old man said, "It's okay, accidents happen." Timmy went home sad because his ball was gone.
