Once there was a little boy who was walking with his mommy. He looked around him and saw a big cliff. He was so curious about it. He wanted to examine it.
So, him and his mommy got closer to the cliff. He started to explore it, but he was so scared. He was feeling helpless. He thought he was too small to do anything.
Mommy saw he was scared and decided to help him. She said that together they could examine the cliff properly. She held him tight and gently explained everything to him. 
He felt much better. They looked closely at all the rocks on the cliff. After that, he was no longer feeling helpless. He was feeling brave!
