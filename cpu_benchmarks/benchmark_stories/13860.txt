Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a curious little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and look at all the things around her. One day, while playing in her yard, she found a big stone. It was very different from other stones, and she could not resist picking it up.
Lily carried the stone with her all day. She showed it to her friends, and they all thought it was special too. They played with the stone, rolling it down hills and using it to build a little tower. The stone became their favorite toy.
At the end of the day, Lily took the stone home with her. She put it on a shelf in her room so she could see it every day. It made her happy to have such a curious stone, and she knew it was a special gift from the world.
