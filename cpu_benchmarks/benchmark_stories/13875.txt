Once upon a time, there was a clean insect named Inny. Inny was a very nice insect who liked to help others. Inny lived in a big green tree with many friends. Every day, Inny would wake up and think about what fun things to do.
One day, Inny found a shiny red ball in the grass. Inny thought it was very pretty and wanted to show it to all of his friends. He knew that something special would happen with this shiny red ball.
Inny showed the shiny red ball to his friends, and they all loved it too. They played with the ball all day long, rolling it and throwing it in the air. But then, the ball rolled far away and got stuck in a hole. Inny and his friends were sad.
Inny had an idea. He asked his friend, a big strong ant, to help get the ball out of the hole. The ant used its strong legs to push the ball out of the hole. Inny and his friends were so happy to have the ball back.
In the end, Inny and his friends played with the shiny red ball every day. They were always happy and had lots of fun together. And just as Inny thought, the shiny red ball brought something special - it brought all of the friends closer together.
