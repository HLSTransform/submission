Once upon a time, in a quiet little house, there lived a boy named Tim. Tim loved to help his mom in the kitchen. One day, Tim's mom asked him to get some milk from the fridge. Tim was very happy to help.
Tim walked to the fridge and opened the big door. Inside, he saw the milk. He took the milk out and closed the fridge. Then, he brought the milk to his mom. His mom smiled and said, "Thank you, Tim! Now we can serve the cookies and milk."
Tim and his mom sat down at the table. They enjoyed their cookies and milk together. Tim felt proud that he could help his mom. They had a lovely time, and the house was quiet and happy.
