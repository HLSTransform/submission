Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow. One day, Lily found a thin stick and started to draw pictures in the snow. Suddenly, she saw a tiny bug and wanted to look at it closer. She ran inside to get her microscope. When she came back outside, she put the bug under the microscope and looked at it. The bug looked so different up close! Then, Lily felt very cold and realized that her fingers were starting to freeze. She went back inside to warm up by the fire.
