Once upon a time there was a black cat. The cat was very lovely. She lived under a big tree near a little house. Every day, the cat would go to the house to find her dinner.
One day, the cat found a bowl of milk and some dry food. She was so happy! She ate every bit. After dinner, she went for a walk around the garden.
In the garden, she saw a beautiful flower. It was so lovely! She was very happy and started to purr.
Suddenly, she heard a voice. It was the little girl who lived in the house. She was calling out for her cat. The Cat and the little girl were very happy to see each other. They hugged and the little girl told the Cat how much she loved her. The Cat purred and enjoyed the love and cuddles. 
And that is how the lovely black cat found a home and became very happy.
