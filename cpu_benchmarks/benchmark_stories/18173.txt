Once upon a time, in a little house, there lived a dog named Spot. Spot had a red collar that he loved very much. Spot would wear his collar every day and show it to all his friends. His friends would look at his collar and feel a little jealous. They wished they had a collar just like Spot's.
One day, Spot went to bed, but he forgot to take off his collar. When he woke up the next morning, the collar was gone! Spot looked everywhere in the house, but he could not find it. He felt very sad and didn't know what to do. His friends saw him looking sad and asked him what was wrong. Spot told them about his missing collar.
Spot's friends wanted to help him find his collar. They looked all around the house and in the yard. Finally, they found the collar under Spot's bed. Spot was so happy to have his collar back! He thanked his friends for helping him find it.
Now, every night before going to bed, Spot remembered to take off his collar and put it in a safe place. And every morning, when he woke up, he would put on his collar and show it to his friends. Spot's friends were still a little jealous, but they were happy to see Spot happy with his collar.
