Once upon a time, there was a tidy house. Inside the house was a radish. It was round and red and it changed. At night, the radish changed from red to green. This made the house even tidier. Every morning the radish changed back to red and the house stayed clean.
The radish was happy. It was always able to be part of a tidy house. The radish felt proud. Every day it went through a cycle, changing from red to green and back again.
One day, the people in the house decided to take out the radish and give it as a present. When they took out the radish they noticed that it was still red. It hadn't changed colors yet.
The people in the house were happy. They knew the radish had been good and tidy. They gave it away and made the house even tidier. From then on, the radish was always a part of someones tidy house.
