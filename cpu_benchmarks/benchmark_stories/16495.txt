Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride his bike, but he didn't like to wear his helmet. His mom always told him to wear it, but he was stubborn and didn't listen.
One day, Timmy was riding his bike and he fell off. He hurt his head and had to go to the hospital. The doctor told him he should have been wearing his helmet. Timmy felt sad and wished he had listened to his mom.
When Timmy got home, he told his mom he was sorry and promised to always wear his helmet. His mom was happy and said, "I'm glad you joined the helmet club! It's important to be safe when we ride our bikes." Timmy smiled and knew he had learned an important lesson.
