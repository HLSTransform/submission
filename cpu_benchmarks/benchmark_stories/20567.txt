Billy was a big strong boy with a bristly smile. He wore the same brown uniform every day to school and loved it. His mom and dad supported him in everything he did and let him know that they believed in him. One day, his uniform got too small and his parents knew it was time for a bigger uniform. So they bought a newer and bigger one with shiny buttons and thick pockets. Billy felt so proud wearing his new uniform and his mom and dad supported him every single day. From then on, Billy felt ready to face any challenge that came his way and knew that his family was always around him, ready to support him no matter what.
