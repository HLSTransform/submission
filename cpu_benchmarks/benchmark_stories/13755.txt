Ben and Lily were playing with their cars on the floor. They liked to make them zoom and crash and honk. Ben had a red car and Lily had a blue car. They pretended they were racing on a big road.
"Ready, set, go!" Ben shouted and pushed his car forward. Lily did the same with her car. They watched as their cars sped along the floor, trying to reach the other side first.
"Vroom, vroom, I'm going to win!" Ben said.
"No, I'm going to win!" Lily said.
They were so close to the end of the road, when suddenly, Ben's car hit a book and flipped over. Lily's car passed by and reached the finish line.
"Yay, I won, I won!" Lily cheered and lifted her car in the air. She felt happy and proud. She had a victory.
"Hey, that's not fair!" Ben cried and picked up his car. He felt sad and angry. He had a loss. "You cheated, you pushed my car!"
"I did not!" Lily said. "Your car hit the book by itself. You were just too slow!"
"That's rude!" Ben said. "You're a bad winner!"
He threw his car at Lily, but missed. Lily threw her car back at Ben, but also missed. They started to yell and fight.
"Stop, stop!" their mom said. She came into the room and saw the mess. She felt worried and annoyed. She had a headache. "What are you doing? Why are you throwing your cars?"
"Mom, she cheated, she pushed my car!" Ben said.
"Mom, he's lying, he's a sore loser!" Lily said.
"Enough!" their mom said. She paused and took a deep breath. She had an idea. "How about we play a different game? A game where you have to work together and share?"
"What game?" Ben and Lily asked.
Their mom smiled and showed them a big puzzle. She had a plan. She hoped they would learn to get along.
"Let's see if you can put this puzzle together. It has a picture of a beautiful rainbow. Do you like rainbows?"
Ben and Lily nodded. They liked rainbows. They forgot about their cars and their fight. They felt curious and excited. They had a new challenge.
"Okay, let's do it!" they said and followed their mom to the table. They started to look for the pieces that matched. They helped each other and said sorry and thank you. They had fun.
Their mom watched them and felt relieved and happy. She had a peace.
