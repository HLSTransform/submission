Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a lamp in her room that she loved very much. The lamp was pretty and made her feel happy when it was on. 
One day, Lily went to visit her friend, Timmy. Timmy's house was very big and had lots of toys. Lily thought Timmy's family must be very wealthy to have such a big house. 
As they played together, Timmy showed Lily his favorite toy. It was a toy car that could go very fast. Lily liked the toy car too and she asked Timmy if she could have one just like it. Timmy told her that he didn't know if he could get her one, but he promised to try. 
Lily was happy to have a friend like Timmy who knew how to share and be kind. She knew that even if she didn't have a toy car like Timmy, she was still very lucky to have a lamp in her room that made her feel happy every day.
