Once upon a time, there was an old man. He had an ancient jar and he wanted to keep it safe. One day, the old man went out for a walk and he left the jar behind.
Suddenly, the old man heard a noise. He came back and saw an animal trying to open the jar. The old man warned the animal to stay away. The animal was scared and ran away!
The old man was happy that his special jar was safe. He held it close and never left it alone anymore. He learned to always keep it close and warn the animals to stay away.
The old man's ancient jar was safe for years and years after that. The end!
