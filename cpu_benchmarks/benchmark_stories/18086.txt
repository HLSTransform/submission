Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily was playing with her toys. She looked outside the window and saw her friends playing outside. She wanted to go outside too, but her mommy said no because it was raining outside.
Lily was sad and bored. She wanted to play with her friends. So, she went to her mommy and said, "Mommy, can I go outside and play with my friends?"
Her mommy said, "No, Lily. It's raining outside. You'll get wet and catch a cold."
Lily did not accept her mommy's answer. She wanted to play with her friends. So, she grabbed her raincoat and ran outside. Her friends were happy to see her, but they were playing a dull game. Lily suggested they play a new game and everyone agreed. They had so much fun playing together in the rain. When Lily came back inside, she was wet but happy. She told her mommy about the fun game they played and her mommy was happy that Lily had a good time.
