Jen and Sam like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They make towers and houses and cars with the blocks. Sometimes they pass the blocks to each other and say, "Here, you take this one."
One day, they decide to make a pattern with the blocks. They put a red block, then a blue block, then a yellow block, then a green block, and then repeat. They make a long line of blocks with the pattern. They are very happy with their pattern.
But then, their big brother Tom comes in. Tom is grumpy. He does not like to play with blocks. He likes to play with his video game. He sees the pattern of blocks and says, "What is this? This is silly. Blocks are for babies. You should play with something else."
He kicks the pattern of blocks and makes them fall. Jen and Sam are very sad and angry. They worked hard to make the pattern. They say, "Tom, you are mean! You broke our pattern! Go away!"
Tom does not care. He laughs and says, "Blocks are boring. Video games are fun. You should play with me." He tries to take Jen and Sam to his room.
But Jen and Sam do not want to go. They like to play with blocks. They say, "No, Tom, we do not want to play with you. You are grumpy. We want to play with blocks. Go away!"
They pass the blocks to each other and start to make a new pattern. They ignore Tom and have fun with their blocks. Tom is still grumpy. He goes to his room and plays with his video game alone.
