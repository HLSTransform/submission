One day, Timmy was playing in the garden. He wanted to go for a walk, but he knew his parents wouldn't permit it.
Timmy asked his mum, "Could I go for a walk please?"
His mum shook her head. "No, Timmy," she said, "you need to stay in the garden, and go straight to bed when it's time."
Timmy was a little sad but he listened and stayed in the garden. He played games, and found a caterpillar. He was very gentle with the caterpillar, and brought lots of leaves for it to eat.
When the sun began to set, Timmy knew his mum was right. He said goodbye to the caterpillar and went home. 
He said to his mum, "I want to go to bed now."
"All right, that's a good idea," she said, smiling. She helped him get into bed, and tucked him in gently.
Timmy said, "I love you, Mum." 
"I love you too," she said. 
Timmy fell asleep soon after, happy to be in his warm and gentle bed.
