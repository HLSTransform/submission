Once upon a time, there was a flower. The flower was very small and it lived in a pot. One day, the flower started to grow and grow until it bloomed into a big beautiful flower. The flower was so happy and it smelled so nice. 
One day, a big truck drove by the flower's pot. The truck was very loud and it scared the flower. The flower was very fragile, so it was afraid the truck might hurt it. But the truck just drove by and didn't hurt the flower at all. 
The flower continued to bloom and grow bigger and bigger. It was so pretty and everyone who saw it loved it. And the flower was happy because it knew it was loved.
