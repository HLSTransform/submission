Once upon a time, there was a kind whale who loved to zoom around the ocean. He zipped and zapped, going faster and faster each day. One day he got so fast, he zoomed right through an open door.
The whale found himself in a room he'd never seen before. Everything was so tall and strange, but he felt curious and brave. The whale looked around, wondering what to do next.
Suddenly, he noticed a button in front of him. It was bright and welcoming, so he had to touch it! As soon as he did, something magical happened. The room filled with light and the walls began to open.
The whale zoomed out of the room and back into the ocean. Everything he had seen before had now become bigger and brighter. He was filled with joy and excitement, realizing he had touched something special.
The whale was so happy that whenever he zoomed around the ocean now, he thought about the open door and the wonderful surprise it had brought.
