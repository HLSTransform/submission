Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Jack. One day, he decided to go for a walk in the park with his spade. 
He saw a big patch of earth and decided to start digging in it. Every time he took a scoop of earth, he found something exciting! He found a pen, a toy car, and even some coins! 
But then Jack heard a voice coming from behind him. When he turned around, he saw a man with a hat. He said to Jack, "what do you think you're doing, young man?" 
Jack was a bit scared, but he was honest. So he said, "I'm digging and finding some things, sir". 
The man smiled and said, "That's alright then. But remember, it's always best to ask first. If somebody owns the ground, you need to turn it back and leave it as you found it. Do you understand?" 
Jack nodded his head. He promised the man that he would always be honest and never dig someone else's ground without asking. Then the man gave him a friendly pat on the head and wished him a good day. 
Jack went back to his digging, but this time he was more careful and honest. He promised himself that he would always be honest and never dig up ground without asking first.
