Once upon a time there was a small girl named Suzy. She was sad all the time because nobody ever wanted to be her friend. She tried to talk to the other kids but they would never listen. One day, Suzy decided to make a present for everyone in her town. She used colorful things and big smiles to make it. When she showed them the present, they weren't very nice. They said harsh things and made fun of her. 
Suzy was so upset, she wanted to hide. But then she remembered something her mom had once told her - to forgive people, even when it's hard. So she opened her heart and forgave the mean kids for being so harsh. 
In the end, the other kids realized how kind Suzy was and soon, she had lots of friends. Everyone in town was so happy and Suzy was too. She knew then that remembering to forgive is the best present of all.
