Once upon a time, a little girl named Anna went to the office with her mom. It was a white office, and Anna was very curious about what was inside. She wanted to explore it! 
As soon as Anna and her mom walked into the office, Anna's mom took out a big flat piece of paper. She showed Anna how to attach it to the wall with tape. Anna was very excited to help with this special project! 
Before long, the big white piece of paper was completely attached to the wall. Then Anna's mom took out some bright markers. She drew lots of colorful pictures on the paper and asked Anna to help. Anna was so happy to help decorate the office! 
When they were finished, the office was even brighter than before. Anna and her mom smiled at each other with pride. They had done a wonderful job of attaching the paper and making the office look so nice!
