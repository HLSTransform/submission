One day, a restless boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a toy gun on the ground. He picked it up and started to play with it. He pretended to be a superhero, saving the day.
Tim saw his friend, Sam, on the swings. He ran to him and yelled, "Look at my gun, Sam! I'm a superhero!" Sam smiled and said, "Cool! Can I play too?" Tim nodded and they played together.
They ran around the park, yelling and laughing. They saved the day with their toy gun. After a long time, they got tired. They sat on the grass, happy from their fun day.
