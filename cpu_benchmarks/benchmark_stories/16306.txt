Once upon a time, there was a big ant. The ant liked to crawl around and explore. One day, the ant found some yummy food. The ant ate and ate until it was full.
But then, the ant got sick. It didn't feel good at all. It tried to wipe its mouth, but it didn't help. The ant got sicker and sicker until it couldn't crawl anymore.
The other ants tried to help, but it was too late. The big ant had eaten something bad and it couldn't be fixed. The other ants were sad, but they knew that the big ant was in a better place now.
