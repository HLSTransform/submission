Once upon a time, there was an old lady. She was very old and her hair was white like snow. She lived in a big house with a garden full of flowers. One day, she went to the classroom to teach the children. The classroom was big and had lots of toys.
The old lady taught the children how to read and write. They all loved her because she was kind and funny. Suddenly, the phone rang and the old lady had to answer it. It was her daughter calling to check on her. The children waited patiently while the old lady talked on the phone.
After the call, the old lady said goodbye to the children and went back to her house. She was happy because she had a good day with the children in the classroom. The end.
