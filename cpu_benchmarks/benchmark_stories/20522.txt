Once there was a small girl named Sarah. She was only three years old and loved going to the beach. One sunny afternoon, she ran down the beach to the ocean with a big smile on her face. The sand was soft and warm and the ocean was blue and beautiful. She could hear the waves crashing on the shore and smell the salty water.
Sarah ran up to the edge of the ocean and began wading in. The cold water felt so good against her skin. The waves gently rocked her up and down. She closed her eyes, held out her arms, and spun in circles. It made her feel so relaxed.
After a few minutes, Sarah lay back in the ocean and floated. She smiled as she felt the warm sun shining on her face. She listened to the birds chirping, the waves crashing, and the sound of the wind blowing. She was so happy and content.
Sarah stayed like that until the sun began to set. Then she got up and ran back to the beach. She was feeling really good and knew it was time to go home. She would come back again soon.
