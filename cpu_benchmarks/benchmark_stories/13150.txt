Molly and Sam were best friends. They did everything together, like playing in the park, or chasing the birds. One day, Molly and Sam decided to play in the garden. As they were running around and exploring, they came across a hole. Molly noticed that the hole needed to be filled up. She tapped Sam and said, "Let's fill it up". Sam and Molly gathered a few rocks and stones and started to fill the hole.
Suddenly, they saw a spider crawling on the ground. Molly was afraid of spiders. But Sam thought the spider was really cool. Sam pointed it out to Molly, and then he tried to catch it. But the spider was too quick for him. The spider zigzagged through the garden until it disappeared.
Molly and Sam kept on filling the hole. After a while, they realized the hole was full of rocks and stones. They were so happy that they had filled it but then they noticed the spider was back. It kept crawling around the hole and seemed very persistent. But after a while the spider gave up and flew away.
Molly and Sam cheered. They were so proud they had filled the hole and made the spider go away. They ran around the garden and happily played the rest of the day.
