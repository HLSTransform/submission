Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys and books. Today, they are at Lily's house. Lily's mom says they can have a snack on the table.
"Yay, snack time!" Lily says. She runs to the table. She sees crackers, cheese, and juice. She is excited.
"Me too, me too!" Ben says. He follows Lily. He sees the snack. He is excited.
They sit on the chairs. They take some crackers and cheese. They say thank you to Lily's mom. They drink some juice.
"Can we clap?" Ben asks. He likes to clap. He thinks it is fun.
"Sure, we can clap!" Lily says. She likes to clap too. She thinks it is fun.
They put down their cups. They clap their hands. They clap fast and slow. They clap loud and soft. They clap high and low. They giggle and smile.
Lily's mom hears them. She comes to the table. She sees them clapping. She is happy.
"What are you doing?" she asks.
"We are clapping!" Lily and Ben say.
"Why are you clapping?" she asks.
"Because we are happy!" Lily and Ben say.
"That's wonderful!" she says. She claps with them. They all clap together. They are happy.
