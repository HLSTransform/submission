Once upon a time there was a family with two children. One day their dad asked them to come outside and help him. He said he wanted to bury something in the ground.
The two children followed their dad into the yard and watched him pick up a fork. "We're going to use this fork to bury something," he said.
The children watched curiously as dad began to dig a hole in the ground. He was quiet and focused on his task. The children waited patiently. Finally, dad finished digging the hole.
He turned to the children and said, "Now it's time to put something in the hole and bury it." The two children didn't move. They were confused. 
Dad then took a big can out of the house and said, "This can is full of our important things. We're going to bury it in the ground so no one can take it." 
The children were sad. They thought it was wrong to bury the can. Dad didn't care what they thought. He put the can in the hole and began to fill it with dirt.
Soon the can was completely buried in the ground. Whatever was inside was gone forever. The two children were very quiet after their dad finished burying the can. They knew they would never see the things inside again.
