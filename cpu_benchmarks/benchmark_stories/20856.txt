Once upon a time, there was a gifted boy who wanted to explore the world. One day, he decided to take his first adventure. He walked out of his house and started down the street. Soon, he came across a strange thing. He had never seen anything like it before! He wanted to get a closer look, so he walked towards it. But just as he was about to reach it, his mom told him to stop.
He didn't know why he had to stop, but he respected his mom's wishes. He stayed still and watched the thing more carefully. He studied every detail of it and wished he could touch it. 
After a few moments, his mom said it was okay for him to continue exploring. So the gifted boy happily took off down the street again, never forgetting the strange thing he had seen.
