Tom was excited. He had a new trumpet. He wanted to play it for his friends. He put on his hat and coat and ran outside.
He saw Lily and Sam in the park. They were playing with a ball. He waved to them and shouted, "Look at my trumpet! It is shiny and loud!"
Lily and Sam stopped playing and ran to Tom. They wanted to see his trumpet. They touched it and looked at it. It was shiny and had many buttons.
"Can you play it?" Lily asked.
"Yes, I can!" Tom said. He put the trumpet to his mouth and blew. He made a loud noise. It sounded like a honk.
Lily and Sam laughed. They liked the noise. They clapped their hands and cheered.
"Can we try?" Sam asked.
"Sure!" Tom said. He was happy to share his trumpet. He gave it to Sam. Sam blew and made another loud noise. It sounded like a moo.
Lily and Sam took turns playing the trumpet. They made different noises. They sounded like animals. They had fun.
Tom smiled. He was glad he had a new trumpet. He was glad he had good friends. He joined them and played the trumpet too. They made music together. They shone like stars.
