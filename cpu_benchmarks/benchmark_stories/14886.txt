Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to eat food, especially pizza. But one day, his mom made something different for dinner. It was a normal meal, but Timmy didn't like it. He wanted pizza instead.
Timmy started to whine and complain, but his mom said he had to eat the normal food. Timmy didn't want to, so he decided to slap the plate away. The food went flying everywhere, and Timmy's mom was very angry.
Later that night, Timmy was still hungry. He realized he should have just eaten the normal food instead of being so picky. From then on, he promised to always try new foods and not to slap his plate away again.
