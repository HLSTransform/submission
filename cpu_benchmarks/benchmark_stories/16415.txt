Anna and Ben are playing with blocks. They want to build a big tower. They take turns to put blocks on top of each other. They are careful not to make the tower fall.
"Look, Anna, I have a blue block. It is very pretty. Where can I put it?" Ben asks.
"Let me see, Ben. Maybe you can put it here, next to the yellow block. It will fit well," Anna says.
Ben tries to put the blue block next to the yellow block. But the blue block is too big. It does not fit. It pushes the yellow block and makes the tower wobble.
"Oh no, Ben, the tower is going to fall!" Anna cries.
They both try to catch the tower, but it is too late. The tower falls down with a loud noise. The blocks scatter all over the floor. Anna and Ben are sad. They worked hard to build the tower.
"Sorry, Anna, it is my fault. I should have found a smaller block," Ben says.
"It is okay, Ben. It was an accident. We can build the tower again. But first, we have to clean up the mess," Anna says.
They start to pick up the blocks and put them back in the box. But they cannot find the blue block. It is hidden somewhere.
"Where is the blue block, Anna? I cannot see it," Ben says.
"Me neither, Ben. Maybe it rolled under the sofa. Let us look there," Anna says.
They go to the sofa and lift the cushion. They find the blue block, but they also find something else. It is a mark on the wall. A big, red mark. It looks like someone drew on the wall with a crayon.
"Uh-oh, Anna, look at that. Who made that mark?" Ben says.
"I do not know, Ben. Maybe it was Max, the cat. He likes to play with crayons," Anna says.
"Or maybe it was you, Anna. You like to draw, too," Ben says.
"Or maybe it was you, Ben. You like to make funny shapes," Anna says.
They look at each other and start to giggle. They do not want to tell the truth. They both made the mark. They did it when Mom was not looking. They thought it was fun. But now they are in trouble.
"Maybe we can hide the mark, Anna. Maybe we can put the sofa in front of it," Ben says.
"Good idea, Ben. Let us try that," Anna says.
They push the sofa to cover the mark. But the sofa is too heavy. It does not move. They try harder, but they only make more noise.
"What are you doing, kids?" Mom says. She comes into the room and sees the mess. She sees the fallen tower, the blocks on the floor, and the mark on the wall. She is not happy.
"Anna, Ben, what is this? Who made this mark?" Mom says.
Anna and Ben look at each other. They do not know what to say. They are sorry. They do not want to lie. They do not want to blame each other. They do not want to make Mom angry.
They decide to tell the truth.
"We did, Mom. We are sorry. We were playing with blocks and crayons. We wanted to make a big tower and a big picture. But we made a big mess. We did not mean to. We tried to fix it. We tried to fit the blue block and hide the mark. But we could not. We are sorry, Mom. Please do not be mad at us," Anna and Ben say.
Mom sighs. She is not happy, but she is not mad either. She loves Anna and Ben. She knows they are good kids. They made a mistake, but they told the truth. They are sorry, and they want to help.
"It is okay, kids. I am not mad at you. I am glad you told me the truth. But you have to be more careful. You cannot draw on the wall. It is not nice. It is hard to clean. And you have to pick up your toys. They can hurt someone. They can make a mess. Do you understand?" Mom says.
"Yes, Mom. We understand. We are sorry. We will help you clean. We will not draw on the wall again. We will pick up our toys. We will be good," Anna and Ben say.
Mom smiles. She hugs Anna and Ben. She is proud of them. They are good kids. They learned a lesson. They will do better next time.
"Thank you, kids. I love you. Now, let us clean up this mess. And then, we can have a snack. And maybe, we can build a tower together. A
