Sally had to choose her snack. She saw a yummy ranch in front of her. It was wet and cold. That was the snack she chose! 
She went outside and sat in the warm sun. She enjoyed the ranch while watching the birds play. She looked up at the clouds and imagined ocean creatures swimming in the sky. 
Sally licked her fingers and smiled. She had chose the perfect snack! Suddenly, she felt a few rain drops on her face. The rain was getting heavier. She was getting wet!
Sally ran home and burst through the door. She was so thankful she had chosen the ranch for her snack. She was safe and warm inside.
