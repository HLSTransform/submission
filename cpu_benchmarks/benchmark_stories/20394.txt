Once upon a time, there was a friendly ghost named Casper. Casper lived in a big, old house with his family. One day, Casper got a letter in the mail. The letter said that there was going to be a big party at the park. Casper was excited because he loved parties.
Casper put on his warm coat and walked to the park. When he got there, he saw lots of other ghosts and they were all having fun. They played games and ate yummy snacks. Casper was happy because he had made lots of new friends.
When the party was over, Casper said goodbye to his new friends and walked back home. He was tired but he felt warm inside because he had so much fun. As he went to bed, he thought about the next party he would go to and the new friends he would make.
