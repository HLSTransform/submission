Mrs. Jones was wealthy. She owned a big motor but never took it out. One day, her little friend, Sue, asked why Mrs. Jones never took her motor out. Mrs. Jones smiled and said, 
"I have a very special plan for my motor. But it's a surprise for everyone! All you need to do is wait."
Sue waited patiently for Mrs. Jones's surprise.
One day, Mrs. Jones took her motor out and all the children cheered. Mrs. Jones named her motor something very special, she called it "The Freedom Express". From that day on, every day Mrs. Jones took her motor out and children from all over town rode it as if it was a magic train, giving them a break from responsibility and a day of pure joy. Everyone learned that day that Mrs. Jones' wealthy motor was actually a priceless gift of freedom.
