Once upon a time there was a scooter. It was very easy to ride, but a 3 year old needed help. The 3 year old wanted to go faster than just walking, so decided to crawl on the scooter. She went round and round the living room, bouncing up and down and laughing. It was so much fun! She felt like the wind was in her hair and was going so fast. After a while, the 3 year old wanted to try something different, so gave the scooter to her mom who started to spin around the living room, going faster and faster. The 3 year old was so amazed to watch and clapped and laughed. They were having such a great time!
