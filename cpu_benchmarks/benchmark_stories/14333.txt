Once upon a time there was a spirit. He was a serious spirit and he liked to go places. One day he decided to go to the woods. Just as he was about to enter, he heard a voice. A voice that made him stop.
The voice said "Don't go any further! Bad things live in this woods!" The spirit was very confused. He was scared of going any further, yet he wanted to know what the voice meant.
So he took a few steps forward. He was met with a fierce animal. After an intense battle, the spirit managed to come out unharmed. He decided to run away.
The spirit learned his lesson that day. He never went places without knowing what to expect. Morals can be learned even in the strangest of places. 
No matter how serious the spirit was, he realized that it was brave to follow his instincts rather than listen to other people's warnings.
