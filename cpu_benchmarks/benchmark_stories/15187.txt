Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lila. She loved to play in the park near her house. 
One day, Lila saw something in the grass. She ran over to it, wondering what it was. It was a pretty glove. She picked it up and looked at it.
"It's so pretty!" she said to herself, and then she ran to find her mom. 
"Mommy! Mommy, I found a pretty glove!" she said with excitement. 
"That's great, Lila! Let's see if someone has lost it," said her mom. 
They came up to a family picnicking in the park. Mom asked them if they had lost a glove. 
The family said no, but the little boy said, "I want it! Can I have it?"
Mommy looked at Lila and said, "It's up to you, Lila. Do you want to yield the glove to the little boy?"
Lila smiled and said, "Yes, I'll yield it to him. I want him to have it and be happy." 
The little boy was so happy to get such a pretty glove and gave her a big hug. Lila was very proud and happy to have made someone so happy.
