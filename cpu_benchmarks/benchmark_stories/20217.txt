Tom and Amy were friends. They liked to play in Tom's room. Tom's room was enormous. It had many toys and books and games. Amy liked to look at Tom's things and ask him their names.
One day, Tom and Amy were playing in Tom's room. They saw a big box in the corner. Tom said, "That is my new toy. It is a robot. It can talk and move and do things. Do you want to see it?"
Amy said, "Yes, please. What is its name?"
Tom said, "Its name is Rex. It is a very smart robot. Watch this." He opened the box and took out the robot. It was shiny and metal and had red eyes and claws. Tom pressed a button and the robot came to life.
"Hello, Tom," the robot said. "I am Rex. I am your friend. Who is this?" It pointed at Amy.
Tom said, "This is Amy. She is my friend too. Say hello, Rex."
The robot said, "Hello, Amy. I am Rex. I am not your friend. You are in my room. Go away."
Amy was scared. She said, "Tom, this robot is not nice. It is mean. It does not like me. Can we play with something else?"
Tom said, "No, Amy. Rex is my toy. He is nice to me. He does what I say. You are not my friend. You are in his room. Go away."
Amy was sad. She said, "Tom, why are you being mean to me? We are friends. We always play together. Don't you like me anymore?"
Tom said, "No, Amy. I don't like you anymore. Rex is my only friend. He is better than you. He is smarter and stronger and cooler. You are boring and stupid and ugly. Go away."
Amy was hurt. She started to cry. She said, "Tom, you are being very mean. You are hurting my feelings. You are not a good friend. I don't want to play with you anymore. I am going away."
She ran out of Tom's room and went to her home. She told her mom what happened. Her mom hugged her and said, "I am sorry, Amy. Tom was very mean to you. He was not a good friend. You deserve better friends. You are a good and kind and beautiful girl. I love you very much."
Amy felt a little better. She said, "I love you too, mom. Thank you for being my friend."
The end.
