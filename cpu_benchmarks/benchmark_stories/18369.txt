One day, a little boy named Tim was playing outside. He was very happy and had a big smile on his face. Tim was hungry, so he went inside to ask his mom for a snack. His mom gave him an apple to eat.
While Tim was eating his apple, he heard a loud noise outside. It was an ambulance with its lights on. Tim was scared and didn't know what was happening. He ran to his mom and told her about the ambulance.
His mom took him outside to see what was going on. They saw a little girl had fallen off her bike and hurt her leg. The ambulance was there to help her. Tim's mom told him that the ambulance was there to make the little girl feel better. Tim felt better knowing that the ambulance was helping the little girl. He smiled and went back to play, feeling happy and safe again.
