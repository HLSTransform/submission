Once upon a time, there was a bird named Ben. Ben had a nest high in a tree. He loved to soar in the sky and feel the wind on his wings. One day, Ben saw his friend Tim, a squirrel, in the tree.
"Hi Tim!" said Ben. "Do you want to see me soar?"
Tim was jealous. He could not soar like Ben. "Yes, Ben. I want to see you soar," Tim said.
Ben flew up into the sky. He soared high and low, fast and slow. Tim watched from the tree and clapped his little paws. Even though Tim was jealous, he was happy for his friend Ben. They played together in the tree and had a fun day.
