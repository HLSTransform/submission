Once upon a time there lived a little girl called Daisy. Daisy was three years old and loved to explore. One day Daisy went looking for something special. Suddenly, she saw something beautiful in the sky. She knew it must have been weighed down, so she ran as fast as she could to investigate. When she got to the sky, she noticed it was only a weak old balloon. Daisy was sad that the balloon was too weak to fly, so she made a wish, hoping one day the balloon would be able to rise into the sky again. She said goodbye to the balloon, then went off to look for something else to explore. The end.
