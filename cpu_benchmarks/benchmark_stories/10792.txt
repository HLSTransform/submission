Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the parade. One day, Lily was walking with her mom and saw a big parade. She was so excited and asked her mom if they could watch it.
Her mom said, "Of course, Lily! Let's find a good spot to watch." They found a spot on the sidewalk and sat down. Lily's mom got her some popcorn and they watched the parade go by.
Lily saw all kinds of things she loved, like clowns, balloons, and horses. She turned to her mom and said, "I love the parade! It's not ordinary, it's special!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad you're having fun, Lily." They watched the rest of the parade together and had a great time.
