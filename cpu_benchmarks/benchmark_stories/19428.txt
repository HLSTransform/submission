Once there was a little girl. She loved to sing. Every day she would go out and sing at the park.
One day, the little girl was at the park and heard a train. She was so excited to see it. It was orange and big and looked like it wanted to play.
She jumped up and down and shouted, "Train! Train!" The train came to a stop and the little girl got on.
The train ride was so much fun. Everywhere the train went, the little girl sang. She sang loud and clear. People smiled and clapped every time she sang.
Finally the train stopped at a dry park. There was nothing much to do, except for sing. So the little girl sang and sang, making the dry park come alive with music.
