Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the yard. One day, he saw his neighbor using a rake to clean up the leaves. Timmy asked, "What is that?" His neighbor replied, "It's a rake. I use it to clean up the leaves."
Timmy wanted to help, so he asked if he could use the rake. His neighbor said yes and showed him how to use it. Timmy loved raking the leaves and making piles.
Later that day, Timmy's mom asked him to clean up his toys. Timmy didn't want to do it, but then he remembered how much fun he had raking the leaves. He understood that cleaning up could be fun too. 
Timmy learned that trying new things can be different and fun. And he also learned that helping others can make them happy.
