Lily and Ben are at the park with their mom. They see a big dog with a shiny collar. The dog is with a lady who has a red purse. Lily and Ben like the dog. They want to pet it.
They run to the dog and say, "Hi, doggy! Can we pet you?" The lady smiles and says, "Sure, you can. His name is Rex. He is very friendly and strong. He likes kids."
Lily and Ben pet Rex. They feel his soft fur and his warm tongue. Rex wags his tail and licks their faces. Lily and Ben giggle. They think Rex is the best dog ever.
But then, they hear a loud noise. It is a big truck. It honks its horn and makes smoke. Rex gets scared. He barks and jumps. He pulls the lady's arm. The lady drops her purse. The purse falls on the ground. It opens and spills many things.
Lily and Ben stare at the purse. They see coins, keys, a phone, a book, and a candy bar. They wonder what else is in the purse. They want to look more.
But the lady says, "Oh, no! Rex, stop! Come back!" She runs after Rex. She tries to catch him. She is worried. She forgets her purse.
Lily and Ben look at each other. They look at the purse. They look at the lady. They don't know what to do. Should they take the purse to the lady? Should they leave it alone? Should they peek inside? What would you do?
