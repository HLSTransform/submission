Once upon a time there was a gentle owl who kept a secret. It was a secret about a special mushroom. She had heard about a magical mushroom that could make animals marry each other. She was determined to find the special mushroom one day.
One day, she flew through the air looking for this magical mushroom. She flew around the tallest tree, she flew around the sparkly lake, but still she couldn't find the special mushroom! She was almost ready to give up, when she heard a small voice.
"I might know where the special mushroom is," said the little voice. 
The owl flew closer to see who was talking. It was a baby bunny!
"Do you really know where the mushroom is?" asked the owl. 
"Yes, I do," said the bunny. He pointed in the direction of a big hill. "It's right up there, at the top of the hill. Be careful, it is a long way up."
So the owl flew off towards the hill. Finally, after a long morning of flying, she found the special mushroom. She was so happy! She knew that the magic mushroom could help her marry the one she loved.
