Tommy loved trains. He had many trains in his room. He played with them every day. He made them go fast and slow, loud and quiet, on the tracks and off the tracks.
One day, Tommy saw a big box in the living room. It had a picture of a train on it. Tommy wanted to open the box and see the train. He asked his mom, "Can I open the box, please?"
Mom said, "No, Tommy, not now. The box is for your birthday. You have to wait until tomorrow."
But Tommy was persistent. He did not want to wait. He tried to open the box when mom was not looking. He pulled and pushed and tore the tape. But the box was too strong. He could not open it.
Mom saw what Tommy was doing. She was not happy. She said, "Tommy, stop that! You are ruining the box and the surprise. You have to be patient and wait for your birthday. It is only one more sleep."
Tommy felt sad. He did not mean to make mom angry. He said, "I'm sorry, mom. I just really like trains. Can I play with my other trains in my room?"
Mom smiled and hugged Tommy. She said, "Of course you can, Tommy. I know you love trains. And I have a secret for you. The train in the box is very special. It can talk and sing and light up. You will love it even more. But you have to wait until tomorrow, okay?"
Tommy nodded and said, "Okay, mom. I will wait. Thank you for the train. I love you."
Mom said, "I love you too, Tommy. Now go and have fun with your other trains. And don't forget to sleep well tonight. Tomorrow will be a big day."
