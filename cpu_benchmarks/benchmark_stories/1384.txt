Once upon a time there was an old man. He was very generous. He liked to visit people and bring them presents. Every day he would get into his old vehicle and drive off looking for someone to visit.
One day he came across a small town and decided to stop and visit. He went from house to house looking for someone to give a present to. Finally, he found a little 3 year old girl. When she opened the door she was so excited to see the old man with a big smile on his face.
The old man was generous and gave the little girl a special toy. She was so happy and thanked him for the wonderful gift. He gave her a big hug and said goodbye. The old man drove away in his old vehicle, smiling thinking of the little girl's face filled with joy.
