Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw with her markers and crayons. One day, she ran out of ink in her favorite marker.
Lily asked her mommy, "Mommy, can you please give me more ink for my marker?"
Her mommy replied, "Sure, sweetie. But first, you need to polish your shoes for school tomorrow."
Lily got busy polishing her shoes with a cloth. When she finished, her mommy gave her a new bottle of ink for her marker. Lily was so happy and said, "Thank you, Mommy! Now I can draw again!"
