Once upon a time, in a small house, lived a little girl named Amy. She was a fine girl who always helped her mom and dad. One day, her mom asked her to clean her room. Amy wanted to do a good job because her mom said she would get a reward.
While cleaning her room, Amy found a magic toy. The toy could shrink things. Amy thought it would be fun to use the toy to shrink her toys and make the room clean faster. She pointed the magic toy at her toys and said, "Shrink!" The toys became very small and Amy put them all in a tiny box.
When Amy's mom saw the clean room, she was very happy. She gave Amy a reward: a big ice cream cone. Amy learned that helping her mom and dad was a good thing and she felt proud. She decided to keep the magic toy a secret, just in case she needed to shrink something again. And they all lived happily ever after.
