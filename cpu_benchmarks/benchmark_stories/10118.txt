Lily and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. The park has swings, slides, and a sandbox. Lily and Sam have fun in the park.
One day, Lily brings her pretty doll to the park. She loves her doll very much. She puts her doll on a bench and goes to the slide. Sam sees the doll and wants to play with it. He goes to the bench and picks up the doll.
"Hey, that's my doll!" Lily says. She runs to the bench and tries to get her doll back. "Give it to me!"
"No, I want to play with it!" Sam says. He holds the doll tight and runs away. Lily chases him and cries.
A lady sees them and stops them. She is a teacher at the park. She talks to Lily and Sam.
"Children, what's the matter?" she asks.
"He took my doll!" Lily says.
"I just wanted to play with it!" Sam says.
The teacher smiles and says, "Why don't you share the doll? Lily, you can lend your doll to Sam for a little while, and then he can give it back to you. Sam, you can play with the doll nicely, and then you can say thank you to Lily. That way, you can both be happy and friendly."
Lily and Sam think about it. They nod and agree. Lily lends her doll to Sam, and Sam plays with it gently. Then he gives it back to Lily and says thank you. Lily smiles and says you're welcome. They hug and say sorry to each other. They go back to the slide and play together. The teacher is proud of them. She says, "Good job, children! You are very kind and polite. Sharing is caring!"
