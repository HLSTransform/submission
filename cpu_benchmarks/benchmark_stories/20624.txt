Once upon a time there lived a famous prince. He lived in a big castle with many rooms. One day, the prince wanted to explore his house and went to the attic. He opened the door and walked in. 
In the attic it was magical. He saw many sparkly things and he smiled. He opened lots of boxes and found lots of fun and interesting things. The prince found a crown and he wore it with pride! 
He opened another box and found a secret key. He opened a small door and saw a huge treasure chest. He opened it and it was full of toys. The prince was so happy and had lots of fun playing with the toys in the attic. 
The prince spent all day exploring the attic and found many exciting things. When he went home, the prince couldn't wait to return to the famous attic to explore again!
