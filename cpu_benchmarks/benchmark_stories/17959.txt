One day, a wise bird named Blue had a pretty feather. Blue wanted to display the feather for all his friends to see. He put the feather on a big rock near the tree where he lived.
A small bird named Tiny saw the feather and asked, "Blue, what is that pretty thing on the rock?" Blue said, "It is my feather, Tiny. I want everyone to see how pretty it is!"
All day, Blue's friends came to see the feather. They all said it was very pretty. Blue was happy that he could share his feather with his friends. They played near the feather until the sun went down.
