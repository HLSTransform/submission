Once there was a bossy elephant. He liked to hang around in the soil every day. He always made sure that the animals around him followed what he said. One day, a mischievous monkey appeared. He started playing in the soil, but the elephant shouted at him to stop. Even when the monkey promised to be careful, the elephant still told him to leave. So the monkey just hung on to a nearby tree and laughed while the elephant got more and more bossy. The other animals didnâ€™t know what to do. Suddenly, the elephant had an idea. He asked the monkey to help him dig the soil and together they found lots of delicious treats. Everyone was happy and they all hung out together in the soil!
