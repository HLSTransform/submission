Once upon a time there were two friends, Molly and Robert. They were playing in the park with their fingers. Robert wanted to rush and have a race.
Molly said, "No, I don't want to rush!" But Robert was very angry and so he pushed Molly and started running away.
Molly was feeling scared. She got up and started running after Robert. As she ran, Robert kept running ahead. Molly felt frustrated - she had to catch up with him.
Suddenly, Robert stumbled and fell down. Molly quickly ran over to check if he was okay. Robert looked up at her, holding his finger that was hurting. Molly helped him up, and Robert was very sorry for rushing and hurting Molly.
They were both happy and they continued playing together, no longer wanting to rush.
