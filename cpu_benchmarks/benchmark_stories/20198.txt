One day, a little girl named Lily went to the zoo with her mom. She saw many animals, like monkeys, lions, and giraffes. She wanted to see the elephants, because they had big ears and long noses.
"Mom, can we go see the elephants?" Lily asked.
"Sure, honey. Let's go this way," Mom said.
They walked to the elephant enclosure, where they saw two big elephants and a baby elephant. The baby elephant was playing with a ball, and the big elephants were eating hay.
"Look, Mom, the baby elephant is so cute!" Lily said.
"Yes, he is. Do you want to introduce yourself to him?" Mom asked.
Lily nodded. She walked closer to the fence, and waved at the baby elephant. The baby elephant saw her, and came closer too. He lifted his trunk, and sniffed Lily.
"Hello, little elephant. My name is Lily. What is your name?" Lily said.
The baby elephant made a loud noise, and flapped his ears. He seemed happy to meet Lily.
"His name is Nelly. He is very friendly," a zookeeper said. He came over to the fence, and smiled at Lily and Mom.
"Hi, I'm Sam. I take care of the elephants. Do you like them?" he asked.
"Yes, I love them. They are big and smart and funny," Lily said.
"I'm glad you do. Do you want to feed them some carrots?" Sam asked.
"Yes, please!" Lily said.
Sam gave Lily and Mom some carrots, and showed them how to hold them for the elephants. Lily and Mom fed the carrots to Nelly and the big elephants. They crunched them with their teeth, and thanked them with their trunks.
Lily and Mom had a lot of fun with the elephants. They thanked Sam for letting them feed them.
"You're welcome. Come back anytime," Sam said.
Lily and Mom said goodbye to the elephants, and went to see other animals. But Lily's favorite animal was still the elephant.
She didn't mind that they were smelly. She thought they were wonderful.
