Lila and Tom were playing in the field. They saw a mule with long ears and a brown coat. The mule was eating grass and flowers. Lila and Tom wanted to pet the mule.
"Let's go and say hello to the mule," Lila said.
"OK, but be careful. The mule might be wild," Tom said.
They walked slowly towards the mule. The mule looked at them and made a loud noise. Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Lila and Tom stopped and smiled. The mule seemed friendly.
"Hi, mule. What is your name?" Lila asked.
The mule did not answer. He just shook his head and snorted. Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
"Can we pet you, mule? You have soft fur and big eyes," Tom said.
The mule nodded and let them touch his ears and nose. He liked the attention. He licked their hands and nuzzled their cheeks. Lila and Tom giggled.
"You are a nice mule. Do you want to play with us?" Lila asked.
The mule nodded again and followed them to the field. They ran and jumped and rolled in the grass. The mule chased them and kicked his legs. Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
They had a lot of fun with the mule. They did not know that the mule was wild. They did not know that the mule had run away from his farm. They did not know that the farmer was looking for his mule. They only knew that they had a new friend.
