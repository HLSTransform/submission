Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going on adventures, so he decided to take a journey through the forest. He packed his backpack with snacks and water, and set off on his journey.
As he walked through the forest, he saw a big zip line hanging from a tree. Timmy was very excited and decided to try it out. He zipped down the line with a big smile on his face.
But then, something serious happened. Timmy tripped and fell off the zip line. He hurt his head and couldn't get up. He was all alone in the forest, and no one could hear him cry for help.
Sadly, Timmy never made it home from his journey. His family searched for him, but they never found him. They were very sad and missed him very much.
