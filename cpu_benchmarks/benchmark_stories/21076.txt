Ben likes pasta. He likes to eat pasta with cheese and sauce. He likes to say "pasta" when he sees it on his plate. He repeats "pasta, pasta, pasta" until his mom gives him a spoon.
One day, Ben is sick. He feels weak and hot. He does not want to eat anything. His mom makes him soup and toast, but he does not want them. He only wants pasta. He repeats "pasta, pasta, pasta" in a soft voice.
His mom hugs him and says, "I know you love pasta, but you need to eat something else to get better. Pasta is not good for your tummy when you are sick. How about some crackers and juice?"
Ben shakes his head. He repeats "pasta, pasta, pasta" in a sad voice.
His mom smiles and says, "Okay, how about this? I will make you some pasta, but only a little bit. And you have to eat some soup and toast first. And you have to drink some water. Deal?"
Ben nods. He repeats "deal, deal, deal" in a happy voice.
His mom makes him some pasta with cheese and sauce, but only a little bit. She puts it in a small bowl. She gives him some soup and toast and water. Ben eats them slowly. He feels a little better. He saves the pasta for last. He repeats "pasta, pasta, pasta" in a proud voice.
He eats the pasta with his spoon. He likes it. He says "thank you, mom" in a sweet voice.
His mom kisses him and says, "You're welcome, Ben. I love you. Now, let's go to bed. You need to rest."
Ben nods. He repeats "bed, bed, bed" in a sleepy voice.
He goes to bed with his mom. He cuddles with his teddy bear. He dreams of pasta. He is happy.
