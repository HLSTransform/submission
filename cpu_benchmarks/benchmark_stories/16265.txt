Once there was a little girl named Maisy. Maisy loved falling asleep in her bed and dreaming about all her incredible adventures. Every night she would climb into bed and look out of her window at the nearby cliff.
One night, Maisy had an especially incredible dream and wanted to go explore the cliff the next day. The next morning, Maisy asked her family: "Can I go up the cliff?" Her family told her it is too high and unsafe for her, but promised to take her to the bottom of the cliff and that she could look up from there. Maisy was excited to go explore the cliff and eagerly headed out.
When Maisy reached the bottom of the cliff, the sight of it was so incredible that she could not take her eyes away. Suddenly, Maisy heard a crash. She looked up and saw a sleeping bear just one inch away from the edge of the cliff. Maisy was amazed, and with a big smile she told her family: "Look, a sleeping bear!"
Maisy and her family safely moved away from the cliff, never forgetting the incredible sight of the sleeping bear. From then on, Maisy never forgot to look up at the cliff, dreaming of the adventures she could have if she could go explore it.
