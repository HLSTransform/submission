Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She lived with her mother in a small house. Sally loved her mother very much.
One day, Sally's mother was upset. She needed more food to supply for their dinner. Sally wanted to help her mother feel better. She put on her shoes and went to the store. Sally bought some food with her piggy bank money.
Sally came back home and showed her mother the food she bought. Her mother was very happy and not upset anymore. They made dinner together and had a great time. The moral of the story is to always help others when they are in need.
