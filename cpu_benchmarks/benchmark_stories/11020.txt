Lily and Tom are going on a big plane with Mom and Dad. They are very happy. They want to see new things and play with new friends. Mom and Dad have passports. Passports are like books with pictures and names. They show who you are and where you can go.
At the airport, they have to wait in a long line. Lily and Tom are bored. They want to jump and run and have fun. But Mom and Dad say they have to be quiet and still. They say they have to show their passports to a tall man. The tall man works at the airport. He checks the passports and stamps them.
Lily and Tom are curious. They want to see the tall man and his stamp. They sneak out of the line and run to the tall man. They say hello and ask him what he is doing. The tall man is surprised. He smiles and says he is helping people go on the plane. He shows them his stamp and lets them touch it. He asks them where they are going. Lily and Tom say they are going to a place with a big castle and a lot of flowers. The tall man says that sounds nice. He stamps their passports and gives them back.
Mom and Dad are worried. They see Lily and Tom talking to the tall man. They run to them and say sorry. They say they have to stay with them and not run away. They thank the tall man and take Lily and Tom back to the line. Lily and Tom are proud. They show Mom and Dad their passports with the stamp. They say they made a new friend. Mom and Dad are relieved. They hug Lily and Tom and say they love them. They say they are ready to go on the plane and have a great adventure.
