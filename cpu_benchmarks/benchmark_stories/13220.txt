One sunny day, a mother set her daughter in the backyard. The little girl was very playful and smiled at the birds singing in the trees. She found a big stick and chased the butterflies around. Then she set a big rock on top of a small one and clapped her hands.
Next, she set some sticks aside and found a large leaf. She held it up to the sun and laughed at the patterns that shone through. She set the leaf down and picked up a bright green grasshopper. She brought it over to her mother and showed her before setting the grasshopper down in the grass.
The mother and daughter spent the rest of the day playing in the backyard. The daughter was so playful that time flew and night time came quickly. They said goodbye to the birds, the butterflies and the grasshopper and went inside. The little girl was very tired, but very happy and quickly fell asleep, dreaming of playful days in the backyard.
