Lily wanted to wear her new dress to the park. It was pink and had flowers on it. She loved her dress very much. She put it on and looked at herself in the mirror. She smiled and twirled around.
"Mommy, can I go to the park now?" she asked.
"Yes, but be careful, Lily. Your dress is very clean and pretty. Don't get it dirty or wet, okay?" Mommy said.
"Okay, Mommy. I will be careful. Bye!" Lily said and ran outside.
At the park, Lily saw her friend Ben. He was playing with a water gun. He saw Lily and waved at her.
"Hi, Lily! Do you want to play with me?" he asked.
"Hi, Ben! Sure, I want to play with you. But don't spray me with your water gun, okay? I have a new dress and I don't want to get it wet," Lily said.
"Okay, Lily. I won't spray you. I promise," Ben said.
But Ben did not keep his promise. He thought it would be funny to spray Lily with his water gun. He aimed at her and pulled the trigger. Water came out of the gun and hit Lily's dress. Lily screamed and cried. Her dress was wet and dirty. She was very sad and angry.
"Ben, why did you do that? You broke your promise! You ruined my dress! I hate you!" she yelled.
"I'm sorry, Lily. I was just joking. I didn't mean to make you cry. Please don't hate me," Ben said.
But Lily did not listen to him. She ran away from him and went back home. She told Mommy what happened. Mommy was not happy. She scolded Ben and told him to go away. She hugged Lily and tried to comfort her.
"I'm sorry, Lily. Your dress is ruined. Maybe we can wash it and make it clean again. But you have to learn a lesson, too. You have to be careful with your things. You can't wear your new dress to the park. You have to wear something else that you don't mind getting dirty or wet. Do you understand?" Mommy said.
Lily nodded. She understood. She wished she had listened to Mommy. She wished she had been more careful. She wished Ben had not sprayed her. She learned her lesson the hard way.
The end.
