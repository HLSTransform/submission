Tom and Lily went to the park with Mom. They liked to play on the swings and the slide. They also liked to look at the flowers and the bugs.
One day, they saw a big butterfly on a pink flower. It had yellow and black wings and a long tongue. Tom wanted to catch it and put it in a jar. He ran after it with his net.
"Tom, don't do that!" Lily said. "The butterfly is not a toy. It wants to be free and fly."
But Tom did not listen. He chased the butterfly until he got close. He swung his net and caught it. He was happy and proud.
But the butterfly was not happy. It was scared and sad. It tried to get out of the net, but it could not. It hurt its wings and legs. It stopped moving.
Tom looked at the butterfly in his net. He saw that it was not moving. He saw that it was hurt. He felt bad. He felt ashamed.
He opened the net and let the butterfly go. He hoped that it would be okay. He said sorry to the butterfly.
Lily came to Tom and hugged him. She said, "It's okay, Tom. You made a mistake, but you learned from it. Next time, you will be kind to the butterfly."
Tom nodded and hugged her back. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good sister. I love you."
Mom came to them and smiled. She said, "I'm proud of you, Tom and Lily. You are good kids. I love you too."
They all went home happy. They learned to respect and care for the butterflies and all the living things in the park.
