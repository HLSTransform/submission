Anna was scared of the dark. She did not like to sleep in her room when the night came. She saw shadows and heard noises that made her cry. She wanted to run to her mom and dad, but they told her she had to be a big girl and sleep in her own bed.
One night, Anna had a new idea. She took her teddy bear and her flashlight and went to the living room. She put some pillows and blankets on the floor and made a cozy nest. She turned on the flashlight and read some books with her teddy bear. She felt happy and safe.
She also did some exercise with her teddy bear. She lifted him up and down, she spun him around, she hugged him tight. She made him laugh and sing. She felt strong and brave.
She did not notice that her mom and dad came to check on her. They saw her smiling and playing in the living room. They felt proud and glad. They did not want to wake her up, so they left her a glass of water and a kiss on the forehead. They went back to their room and turned off the lights.
Anna and her teddy bear fell asleep in their nest. They dreamed of sunny days and fun adventures. They did not mind the dark anymore. They had each other to comfort them.
