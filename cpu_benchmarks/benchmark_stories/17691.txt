Today was a big day for Mommy, Daddy, and their little girl. They were going on an adventure! 
Mommy packed a big bag with all the things they would need. Daddy had a flag to fly when they arrived. 
The girl was so excited. She was so playful, and while Mommy and Daddy packed the car, she ran all around the house, dreaming about their trip. 
Finally, Mommy and Daddy were finished packing and the car was ready to go. Mommy called, "It's time to go!" The little girl cheered, grabbed the flag, and off they drove. 
The adventure was about to begin!
