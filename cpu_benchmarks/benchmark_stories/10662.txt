Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She had soft hair and a big smile. She was the best at everything, but had a problem. She couldn't grab the language.
Everywhere she went, everyone talked, but she didn't understand. She would struggle to make sense of it all and it made her sad. She wanted to talk too, but it just wouldn't work.
One day, her family came together to help. They sat down with her and tried to show her how to grab the language. It was tricky at first, but with lots of help and patience, she got better and better.
Finally, her hard work paid off and she started to grab the language. She talked, laughed and played with her family. She was so proud of herself and so happy.
The End.
