Tommy was very frustrated. He wanted to pick out a shirt to wear that day, but he couldn't find one that he liked. No matter what he looked at, he just wasn't happy with any of them.
He paused and thought for a moment. He knew he had seen a shirt in the store that he thought would be perfect. He forgot where it was!
He began searching through the store. He looked and looked, but couldn't find it. Then, he spotted it in the fashion section. It was a bright green shirt with polka dot patterns. It was just what he wanted!
He was so excited and ran to grab it. He couldn't wait to show his friends at school the next day.
