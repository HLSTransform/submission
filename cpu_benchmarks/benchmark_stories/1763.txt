John was a little boy. He was just three years old. He liked to act and pretend. One day, he saw a raven on his walk. It was easy to spot because it was huge and black.
John wanted to act like the raven. He wanted to be big and strong. So, he put his arms out like wings and pretended to fly. He ran around and made cawing noises. Soon, he was enjoying himself.
When he got home, his parents were very excited. They had a surprise for him: a little toy raven. John was so happy! He was so glad to have a little raven of his own. He ran around with it and made cawing noises just like before.
John had lots of fun when he acted like a raven. He was reminded that no matter how big and strong he felt, he was still only three years old. This would be a lesson John would remember for a long time.
