Once upon a time, there was a fish named Nemo. He lived in a big blue ocean with his friends. One day, Nemo got lost and he didn't know how to find his way back home. He swam and swam, but he couldn't see his reef. 
Suddenly, he saw a big, gentle turtle named Crush. Crush asked Nemo what was wrong and Nemo told him that he was lost. Crush said, "Don't worry, little dude. I can help you find your way back home." 
Crush swam with Nemo and showed him the way to his reef. Nemo was so happy to be back home with his family and friends. He thanked Crush for his help and they became good friends. From that day on, Nemo knew that if he ever got lost again, he could always count on Crush to help him. The end.
