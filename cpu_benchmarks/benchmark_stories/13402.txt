Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily wanted to climb a big mountain. She was very eager to start her adventure. She packed her bag with some snacks and water, and off she went.
As she climbed higher and higher, she saw a big scale on the ground. She wanted to weigh herself to see how much she had climbed. But as she stepped on the scale, she heard a loud noise. It was a bear! The bear was angry and started to chase Lily.
Lily was scared, but she knew she had to do something. She quickly grabbed a stick and waved it at the bear. The bear got scared and ran away. Lily was relieved and continued her climb up the mountain. She finally reached the top and felt very proud of herself for overcoming the conflict with the bear.
