There once were two friends, Alex and Tommy. One day it started raining and Alex wanted to go outside to play. But Tommy said that he had to stay inside.
Alex was very sad. He wanted to play, but Tommy was so insistent that he had to stay inside.
Soon, the rain stopped and Alex and Tommy looked outside. The sun was now shining, and not a single raindrop was available. 
Tommy then told Alex that he was right to make him stay inside. If they had gone out, they would have gotten very wet.
This taught Alex a very important lesson; sometimes it is better to stay indoors even if you really want to go out. If a storm is coming, it is better to be safe than sorry!
