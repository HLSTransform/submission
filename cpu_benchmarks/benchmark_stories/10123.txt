Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big tree with a swing. They run to the swing and take turns.
"Can I go first?" Lily asks.
"Okay, but only for a little bit," Tom says.
Lily gets on the swing and holds the rope. She pushes with her feet and goes high. She feels happy and free. She laughs and says, "Look at me, Tom! I'm flying!"
Tom watches and claps. He waits for his turn. He wants to go high too.
But then, something bad happens. Lily's hand slips and she falls off the swing. She lands on the ground and hurts her knee. She cries and says, "Ow, ow, ow! It hurts!"
Tom runs to her and helps her up. He sees blood on her knee. He says, "Oh no, Lily! You have a boo-boo! Come on, let's go to the bench. There's an old lady there. Maybe she has a band-aid."
They walk to the bench, where an old lady is sitting. She has gray hair and glasses. She sees Lily and Tom and smiles. She says, "Hello, children. What's the matter?"
Lily shows her knee and says, "I had a trip and fell off the swing. It hurts a lot."
The old lady says, "Oh, you poor thing. Don't worry, I have a band-aid for you. Here, let me put it on your knee. There, does that feel better?"
Lily nods and says, "Thank you, lady. You are very nice."
The old lady says, "You're welcome, dear. And you, young man, you are a good friend. You helped your friend when she was hurt. That's very kind of you."
Tom says, "Thank you, lady. We are friends. We like to play together."
The old lady says, "That's wonderful. Friends are important. You know, when I was young, I had a friend too. We used to play in the park and hang from the branches of the trees. We had so much fun."
Lily and Tom listen to the old lady's story. They forget about the pain and the fall. They smile and say, "That sounds fun. Can you tell us more?"
The old lady says, "Of course, I can. Come, sit with me. I'll tell you all about it."
And so, Lily and Tom sit with the old lady and listen to her stories. They learn about the past and the present. They laugh and talk. They make a new friend. They are happy.
