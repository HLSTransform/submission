Once upon a time there was a pretty house. Inside, a man and his family lived happily. One day, the family heard a noise outside. It was a thief! The thief was trying to break in and steal the man’s precious things.
The family was scared, but they knew what they had to do. They quickly ran to the back door and opened it wide. Then, the man called out to the thief. He said, “You must leave now, or we will call the police!”
The thief was very scared and ran away. The family was relieved and thanked their lucky stars.
The next day, the man decided to set up a special lock on his door. This way, no thief could ever enter his house again. He put a big round button on the wall outside. Whenever someone wanted to come in, they had to press the button to release the lock on the door.
From then on, the family was safe and happy in their pretty house.
