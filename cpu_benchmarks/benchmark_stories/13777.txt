Tom and Lily liked to jog in the park. They liked to see the trees, the flowers and the birds. They also liked to look for bugs. They had a jar to keep the bugs they found.
One day, they saw a big, shiny bug on a leaf. It had many colors and wings. Tom wanted to catch it and put it in the jar. Lily said, "No, Tom, that is a cheap thing to do. The bug is happy on the leaf. It does not want to be in the jar. Let it be free."
Tom did not listen to Lily. He ran to the leaf and grabbed the bug. He put it in the jar and closed the lid. He was proud of his catch. He said, "Look, Lily, I have the best bug ever. It is so pretty and rare. You are just jealous."
Lily was sad and angry. She said, "Tom, you are not nice. You are selfish and mean. The bug is not happy in the jar. It is scared and sad. You should let it go. It is not yours to keep."
Tom did not care. He said, "No, Lily, this is my bug. I caught it fair and square. I will not let it go. It is mine."
But then, something bad happened. The bug was not a bug at all. It was a bee. And it was very angry. It stung Tom through the jar. Tom screamed and dropped the jar. The jar broke and the bee flew away. Tom cried and held his hand. It hurt a lot.
Lily ran to Tom and helped him. She said, "Tom, I am sorry you are hurt. But you should have listened to me. You should not take things that are not yours. You should respect the life of others. That is the right thing to do."
Tom nodded and said, "Lily, you are right. I was wrong. I was cheap and greedy. I should have let the bee be. I am sorry. Can you forgive me?"
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, Tom, I forgive you. You are my friend. But next time, please be more careful and kind. And maybe we should look for other bugs. Bees are not fun to play with."
Tom agreed and said, "Yes, Lily, you are right. Bees are not fun to play with. They are better to watch from far away. And there are many other bugs to find. Let's go and jog some more. Maybe we will see a butterfly or a ladybug. They are pretty and gentle. And they do not sting."
Lily and Tom hugged and jogged away. They learned a lesson that day. They learned to be respectful and not cheap. And they had more fun with the bugs that did not hurt them.
