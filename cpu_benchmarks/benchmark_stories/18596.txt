Once upon a time, there was a crane. The crane had a weird bow on its head. The bow was red and had polka dots. The crane liked to show off its weird bow to all the animals in the forest. 
One day, the crane saw a butterfly flying by. The butterfly had a pretty bow too, but it wasn't weird like the crane's bow. The crane wanted to show the butterfly its bow, so it flapped its wings and flew over to the butterfly. 
The butterfly thought the crane's bow was very weird, but also very cool. The crane was happy that the butterfly liked its bow. From then on, the crane and the butterfly became good friends and would often show off their bows to each other. The end.
