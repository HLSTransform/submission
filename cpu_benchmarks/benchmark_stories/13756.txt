Lily and Ben were hungry. They wanted to eat something yummy. Mom said she had tuna for them. Tuna was a fish that came in a can. Lily and Ben liked tuna.
Mom opened the can and put some tuna on two plates. She added some sweet corn and some cheese. She gave one plate to Lily and one to Ben. She said, "Here you go, my darlings. Enjoy your lunch."
Lily and Ben said, "Thank you, Mom." They started to eat their tuna. They thought it was very tasty. They ate it all up. They felt happy and full.
Mom said, "Do you want some fruit for dessert?" Lily and Ben nodded. They loved fruit. Mom gave them some grapes and some bananas. They ate them too. They said, "Thank you, Mom. You are the best."
Mom smiled and said, "You are very welcome, my loves. Now, why don't you settle down on the couch and watch some cartoons? I have to do some work."
Lily and Ben said, "Okay, Mom." They went to the couch and snuggled up. They watched some cartoons. They felt cozy and sleepy. They closed their eyes and drifted off. Mom came and covered them with a blanket. She kissed them and said, "Sweet dreams, my angels."
