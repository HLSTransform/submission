The doctor was packing his bag. It was heavy with lots of different things in it. He had to go to work so he picked it up and started to leave. Suddenly, he felt unwell. He felt very weak and he sat down. He knew he had to keep going but he just couldn't do it. He had to get help. He asked his neighbour to call the doctor. 
The doctor came over and looked at him. He made the doctor very worried. He said he had to go to the hospital right away. The doctor got into the car and they drove away. 
At the hospital, the doctor did some tests. He said that the man was very sick and that he had to stay in the hospital for a while. The man was sad. He had to be away from his family and all of his things. 
The man stayed in the hospital for many months. He tried very hard to get better. But, sadly, he never did get better. The doctor said he had to stay in the hospital, forever.
