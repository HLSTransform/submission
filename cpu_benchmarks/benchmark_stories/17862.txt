Bob was a 3 year old. He lived in a small house with his mom. He had a lot of toys that he liked to play with every day.
One day, it started to rain outside. Bob asked his mom what was happening, and she told him it was a hurricane. He didn't know what a hurricane was, so she tried to explain it.
She said a hurricane was a strong wind with rain and thunder. Bob was scared at first, but then he listened to the wind outside and thought it sounded exciting. 
The wind got stronger and stronger, and then the rain came down harder. But the next day, the sun came out and Bob was happy to see it. He asked his mom to tell him a story about the hurricane. 
She told him a story about a hurricane that happened many years ago. Everyone had to go inside and stay safe while the hurricane blew, and then they would come out and find things were different. There was lots of destruction and the people were so sad. It was a very bitter moment, but then they started to work together and make things better. 
Bob was so glad that he had his mom to tell him stories and comfort him when he was scared.
