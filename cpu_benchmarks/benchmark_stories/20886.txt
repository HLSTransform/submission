Timmy and Lucy were playing in the park. Timmy was in the swing and Lucy was running around and chasing a butterfly. Suddenly, Lucy started to panic when she noticed all the ink on her dress. "My dress is ruined!" she said.
Timmy wanted to help his friend so he jumped out of the swing and ran towards her. "What do you need?" he asked.
"I need to wash this dress so it looks clean again" Lucy replied. Timmy thought of an idea. "We can go to the stream over there and use the water to wash it" he said.
Lucy felt very relieved and was thankful for Timmy's help. She smiled and thanked him.
The two of them went to the stream, each feeling independent. Although it was difficult for them, they managed to get the ink off the dress. 
The two of them ran back to the swing and finished their playtime, both feeling very proud and happy of their independence.
