Once there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy was very curious, and she wanted to explore the world. She had a special spot that she loved, the closet in her bedroom. She would always open the closet door and find things inside.
Today was no different, and Lucy eagerly opened the closet door. But when she opened the door, she found something strange - the closet was full of dirt! It was a dirty closet.
Lucy was so excited to explore, so she used her little hands and started digging inside the closet. As she dug, she discovered all sorts of interesting and fun things. She found a box of markers and a box of crayons, and she found a stuffed animal too!
Once she was done playing and exploring, Lucy grabbed a brush and dustpan and began to clean up the closet. She swept away all the dirt and put all of the toys back inside. Then she shut the door and said goodbye to her special spot.
Lucy was satisfied, and she was glad that she had opened the closet door!
