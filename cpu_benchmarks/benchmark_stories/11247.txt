Once upon a time, there were two children. One child was clever, the other was very foolish. They were walking along the path to school when they passed by a garden. The clever child said to the foolish one, “We should poke that garden.” 
But the foolish one said, “No, don’t be silly. That’s not a good thing to do. We should focus on the math lesson.” 
The clever child laughed and said, “Don’t worry, I just thought it would be fun.” 
Still, the foolish one didn’t budge. He said, “No, let’s go to school now. Math is more important.” 
So the two children continued on their way to school. But when they got there, they were surprised to see their teacher with a garden fork in his hand. He was mad and said to the two children, “Why did you poke my garden?!” 
The clever child smiled and said, “I told the foolish one that it would be fun. He didn’t want to do it, so I did it myself.” 
The teacher shook his head and said, “That was foolish of you. Next time, focus on math instead.” 
The two children learned their lesson
