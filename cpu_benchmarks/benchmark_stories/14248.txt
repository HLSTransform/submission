Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bob. He liked to listen to songs. One day he heard a loud noise. It was a loud yell! Bob felt scared and hid under the table. But then he heard a mild song. He looked around to find the song. It was coming from outside the window! He ran to the window and saw a bird singing the mild song. Bob smiled and laughed. He jumped up and down and shouted with joy! He loved the mild song and wanted to hear it again and again. The bird was happy and sang the song again. Bob laughed and danced to the music. He sang along and yelled out the loudest he could. Bob had found a new way to have fun!
