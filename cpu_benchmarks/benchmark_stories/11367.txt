Once there was a little girl who loved to solve puzzles. She spent many hours finding the answers and loved how proud she felt when she solved them. Today the little girl had a very special and difficult puzzle. She put it on the floor and looked at it. It was in the shape of her leg!
The little girl laughed and said to herself, "let's see if I can solve this puzzle". She was determined to get it right and started to work on it. She put the pieces together but the leg felt too tight and she couldn't get it in the right place. 
She kept trying, but no matter what she did, the leg didn't fit. She was getting frustrated, she had never had a puzzle she couldn't solve before. Suddenly there was a loud bang and the leg broke! 
The little girl was sad and began to cry. She had worked so hard on the puzzle and was so close but in the end it was too tight and it broke. She tried to fix it but it was no use. She learned an important lesson that day - that puzzles can be tricky.
