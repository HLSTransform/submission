One day, a child and his mom went to the park. It was a hot day, and the sun was bright. The child played with his ball, his truck, and his kite. He ran and jumped and laughed. He had a lot of fun.
But after a while, he felt tired. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. He went to his mom and said, "Mom, I want to go home. I'm sleepy."
His mom smiled and hugged him. She said, "Okay, my sweetie. Let's go home. You played very well today. You can take a nap when we get home."
She packed his toys and his water bottle. She held his hand and they walked to the car. The child yawned again and leaned on his mom. He said, "I love you, mom."
His mom said, "I love you too, my child." She kissed his head and drove him home. He fell asleep on the way, dreaming of the park.
