One day, Mum and Dad took their three year old, Jake, to the science museum. They were especially excited to see the microscope, and they couldn't wait to show it to Jake. 
As they walked up to the impressive microscope, Mum and Dad explained to Jake that he would be able to see things that were too small to see with the naked eye. Jake thought it sounded really exciting, and he wanted to add something to the microscope to see what it could do.
Dad smiled and carefully added a tiny leaf to the microscope. Jake leaned in and looked through the microscope, and he was amazed.
"Wow," he said, "it's amazing." Mum and Dad smiled at each other.
Jake spent the rest of the day looking through the microscope and examining things like drops of water and bits of soil. He was so excited, and everyone was really impressed with his microscope discoveries.
