Jim and his mum were in the park. Jim saw an old man wearing a jolly vest. Jim smiled and said hello. The old man said hello back and smiled too. He had a few coins in his hand and asked if Jim wanted them.
Jim was excited and thanked the old man. He put the coins in his pocket. His mum said that he should clap for the old man for being kind.
So Jim clapped and laughed. His mum clapped too. The old man smiled and said goodbye. Jim waved back and ran off to play. 
They had a jolly time at the park that day.
