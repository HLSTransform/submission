Once upon a time there was a little girl who dreamed of having a new toy. Every day she would imagine what her new toy could be. She imagined the toy being big and colorful. 
One day she decided to tell her mom all about her dream. She excitedly said "Mommy, can I get a new toy?" Her mom smiled and said "Of course you can!" 
The next day they went to the toy store and the little girl was so happy. She had never been to a toy store before! She looked around and finally saw what she dreamed of: a brand new teddy bear! She squeezed it tight and told her mom "This is the best toy ever!" 
The little girl went home with her new teddy bear and hugged it all night. She was so happy and thankful she had the chance to make her dream come true.
