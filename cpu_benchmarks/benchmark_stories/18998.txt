Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys on the table in her room. One day, her mom came in and said, "Lily, we need to sort your toys. Let's put all the dolls in one pile and all the cars in another pile."
Lily said, "Okay, Mommy!" and they started to sort the toys. Lily put all the dolls in one pile and all the cars in another pile. After a while, Lily started to feel dizzy from all the sorting.
Her mom said, "Lily, let's take a break and have a snack." They sat at the table and ate some crackers and cheese. Lily felt much better after her snack.
Then, her mom said, "Lily, now that we have sorted your toys, let's play with them! Which pile do you want to play with first?"
Lily said, "I want to play with the dolls!" And they had a fun time playing with all the dolls on the table.
