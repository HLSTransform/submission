Once upon a time there was a big, dark room. In the corner was a book. The book opened with a creak and inside were many pages of different colours and sizes.
Suddenly, the pages began to spin around very quickly. They flew out of the book and covered the whole room. Everywhere was dark and the pages were everywhere.
Then, the pages started to come together and stick in a pile in the middle. They slowly built themselves up into shapes and within a few moments it was as if a new book had been formed.
The room lit up and there on the table was a new book. The pages were now covered by a dark blue cover with a picture of a smiling moon on the front.
A tiny voice emerged from the corner. It was the 3 year old child who had made the book from the pages. She was so happy with her new book that she ran off to show her mommy.
