Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot lived in a small shelter made of wood. The wood was rough, but it kept Spot safe and warm.
One day, it rained a lot. The ground became wet and slippery. Spot wanted to go outside and play, but he was scared he would slip and fall. He stayed in his shelter, watching the rain fall.
When the rain stopped, Spot went outside. He was very careful not to slip on the wet ground. He played all day and had lots of fun. At night, he went back to his rough shelter, happy and tired.
