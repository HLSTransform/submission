Mia and Ben are friends who like to make music. Mia can sing and Ben can play the drum. They gather sticks and stones and other things to make more sounds. They are playful and happy.
One day, they see a big truck in the park. It has a sign that says "Musician Wanted". Mia and Ben are curious. They go to the truck and knock on the door. A man opens it and smiles.
"Hello, little ones. Are you musicians?" he asks.
"Yes, we are!" Mia and Ben say.
"Really? Can you show me what you can do?" the man says.
Mia and Ben nod. They take out their drum and their sticks and stones. They start to make music. Mia sings a song and Ben beats the drum. They also use the sticks and stones to make different sounds. They are loud and fun.
The man listens and claps. He likes their music. He has an idea.
"Wow, you are very good! How would you like to join me on the stage?" he says.
"On the stage?" Mia and Ben say.
"Yes, on the stage. I am a musician too. I play the guitar. I have a show here in the park. But I need some help. Do you want to help me?" he says.
Mia and Ben look at each other. They are excited. They want to help. They want to be on the stage.
"Yes, please!" they say.
The man smiles. He takes them to the stage. He gives them a microphone and a speaker. He tells them to wait for his signal. He goes to his guitar and starts to play. The people in the park gather around. They hear the music. They are curious.
Then, the man gives the signal. Mia and Ben start to sing and play. They are loud and fun. The people in the park clap and cheer. They like their music. They are playful and happy.
Mia and Ben are happy too. They are on the stage. They are musicians. They have a new friend. They have a lot of fun.
