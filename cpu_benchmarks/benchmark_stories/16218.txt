It was a quiet Sunday morning in the park. Mom and Dad took the little girl to play in the park. They had a picnic basket full of food and drinks.
The girl asked: "Mom, can I play?"
"Yes of course," replied Mom. "But make sure you work hard so you don't get tired." Dad smiled and said: "Come on, let's play with the ball!"
The little girl started to run around, kicking the ball and laughing. Mom and Dad watched as she played and smiled.
After a while, the girl started to get tired. She stopped running and said: "I need a break. I'm tired from all this work!"
Mom and Dad laughed and said: "It's OK! We can take a break. Let's have a picnic!"
So the three of them sat down on the grass, enjoyed their picnic, and talked about their wonderful day.
