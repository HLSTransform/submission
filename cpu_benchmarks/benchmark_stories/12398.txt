Bob was very excited to go to the park today. He had been waiting for so long! He ran outside, but his mom insisted that he wear his coat. Bob grumbled and groaned. Eventually, he reluctantly put it on and they left. 
At the park, Bob found the perfect climbing structure. He wanted to climb it all the way to the top, but his mom insisted he only go to the middle. Bob asked to go higher, but his mom said no. Bob started to complain, but his mom said he had to listen to her. 
Suddenly, an idea occurred to Bob. He had an escape plan! He pretended to listen to his mom and he went to the middle of the structure. Then he ran to the top of it, smiling all the way. His mom was so surprised that she couldn't react quickly enough. Bob was so excited to have escaped his mom's rules! He had climbed to the very top of the structure. He celebrated by raising his arms in victory. 
Bob's mom finally reached the top, very annoyed. She said, "That was very naughty of you, Bob". Bob said, "I'm sorry, mommy. I just wanted to feel like I had escaped the rules". His mom said, "Well then, next time you feel like escaping, be sure to ask me before you act!" Bob agreed, but inside he was still very excited.
