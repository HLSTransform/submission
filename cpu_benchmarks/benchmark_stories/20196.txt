Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with chalk on the sidewalk. They draw flowers, stars, and animals. Lily has many colors of chalk. Ben only has white chalk.
One day, Lily draws a big rainbow with her chalk. She uses red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Ben looks at her rainbow. He thinks it is very pretty. He wants to draw a rainbow too. But he only has white chalk. He feels jealous of Lily.
He notices a pink chalk on the ground. It is not Lily's chalk. It is from another kid who left it there. Ben picks up the pink chalk. He thinks he can use it to draw a rainbow. He starts to draw on the sidewalk next to Lily's rainbow.
Lily sees Ben drawing with the pink chalk. She is angry. She thinks Ben took her chalk. She says, "Hey, that is my chalk! Give it back!" Ben says, "No, it is not your chalk. I found it. It is mine!" They start to argue. They are not friends anymore.
A lady walks by. She sees Lily and Ben fighting over the chalk. She says, "What is going on here? Why are you not sharing?" Lily and Ben tell her their story. The lady says, "That is not nice. You should not be jealous or angry. You should be kind and generous. You can both use the chalk and draw together. There is enough for everyone." She gives them a smile.
Lily and Ben feel sorry. They say sorry to each other. They decide to share the chalk and draw together. They finish their rainbows. They also draw hearts and smiles. They are friends again. They thank the lady for her help. They are happy.
