Once there was a girl named Mandy. She was only 3 years old. One day, Mandy was walking outside in the dark. Suddenly, she saw something that made her stop. It was a big, glowing ball. It was beautiful. 
Mandy was so excited that she clapped her hands and ran towards it. As she got closer, she saw a sign next to the glowing ball. It said “Welcome”.
Mandy didn't know what it meant, so she walked closer and closer. She saw something strange. The glowing ball was a bit bitter. She was scared and stepped back. Mandy didn't know what was happening. 
But then, in the darkness, Mandy heard a voice. It said “Welcome, Mandy. Have fun and it won't be bitter.” Mandy smiled and stepped closer again. She couldn't believe how wonderful the glowing ball was. 
From then on, Mandy visited the glowing ball every day. It was her special place, filled with warmth and welcome.
