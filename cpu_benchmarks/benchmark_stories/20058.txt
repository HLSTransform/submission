Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a white cat named Snowy. One day, Lily and Snowy went to the park to play. They saw some kids playing a game with a ball.
"Can we play too?" asked Lily.
"Sure, you can join us," said the kids.
They played and played until Lily's team won. "We won! We won!" shouted Lily.
Snowy was so happy that he started jumping up and down. "Meow! Meow!" he said.
After the game, Lily's mom asked her, "How did you win?"
"I used my brain," replied Lily.
Snowy purred and licked his paw. He was proud of his friend for using her brain.
