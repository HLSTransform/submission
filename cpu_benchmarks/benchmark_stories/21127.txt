Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a brother named Sam. They liked to play together. One day, they wanted to play with a big toy. But the toy was difficult to use.
Tim said to Sam, "I don't understand how to play with this toy." Sam looked at the toy and said, "I don't understand either." They both felt sad because they could not play with the toy.
Then, their mom came to help. She showed Tim and Sam how to play with the toy. Now, they understood how to play and had a lot of fun. Tim and Sam were happy that they could play with the difficult toy together.
