Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to build things with his tools. One day, Timmy's dad gave him a rare tool to use. Timmy was very happy and said "thank you" to his dad. 
Timmy wanted to build a big tower with his new tool, but he didn't know how to use it. He asked his dad for help, and his dad showed him how to use the tool. Timmy then made a request to his dad, asking if they could build the tower together. 
Timmy and his dad worked together and used the rare tool to build the biggest tower they had ever seen. Timmy was so proud of himself and his dad. He said "thank you" to his dad again and they both smiled. From that day on, Timmy loved using his rare tool to build things with his dad.
