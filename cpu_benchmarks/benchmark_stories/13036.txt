Once there was a little girl called Lizzie. She loved travelling around, so she had always been dreaming of going on a special adventure.
When the day came, Lizzie was so excited! She started to pack her bags. She packed her favourite clothes and a perfect red horn. The horn was shiny and it made the most beautiful sounds!
When Lizzie was finished packing, she headed out on her adventure. She could hear her horn blowing in the wind as she walked away. 
It was a perfect day and Lizzie couldn't believe she was living out her dream. She played with her horn and sang songs as she walked along her special journey. 
Lizzie had the most amazing day. She was so happy she had packed her horn.
