Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very special. She wanted to help people, so she decided to put some seeds in the garden. She watered them and made sure they were in the right spot.
One morning she woke up and went to the garden to check on her flowers. To her surprise, they had grown into something incredible! There were so many beautiful flowers and she couldn't believe it. 
She ran to her mother, excited to show her what she had done. Her mother encouraged her to keep going and said that when you help others it's an amazing thing. The little girl was happy and she kept up her hard work.
The moral of this story is that when you put in hard work and help out others, the rewards can be incredible.
