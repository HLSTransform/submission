Ben and Mia are at the beach with Mom and Dad. They like to play in the sand and splash in the water. They see many things at the beach: shells, crabs, birds, boats.
"Look, look!" Mia says. She points to the sea. "I see a dolphin!"
Ben looks too. He sees a big gray fish with a fin. It jumps out of the water and makes a noise. "Wow, a dolphin!" Ben says. "It is so cool!"
Mom and Dad come over. They see the dolphin too. They smile and take pictures. "Dolphins are very smart and organized animals," Mom says. "They live in groups and help each other."
"Can we play with the dolphin?" Mia asks.
"Sorry, sweetie, we can't," Dad says. "The dolphin lives in the sea, and we live on the land. We have to respect its home and let it be free."
"OK," Mia says. She waves to the dolphin. "Bye, dolphin! Have fun!"
The dolphin waves back with its tail. It dives into the water and swims away. Ben and Mia clap and cheer. They are happy to see a dolphin at the beach.
