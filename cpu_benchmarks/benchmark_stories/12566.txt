Tom and Jen are husband and wife. They like to go to the park and play with their dog, Max. One day, they see a big sign that says "Dog Show". They think Max is very smart and cute, so they want to enter him in the show.
They fill out a form and wait for their turn. They see other dogs do tricks, like sit, roll over, and fetch. They are proud of Max and think he can do better. They practice with him and give him treats.
When their name is called, they walk to the stage with Max. They smile and wave at the people. They tell Max to sit, and he does. They tell him to roll over, and he does. They tell him to fetch, and they throw a ball. But Max does not run after the ball. He runs to the other side of the stage, where he sees a big cake. He jumps on the table and starts to eat the cake. The cake is for the judges and the winners. The people gasp and laugh. The judges are angry and tell Tom and Jen to leave.
Tom and Jen are very embarrassed. They grab Max and run away. They are ashamed of their dog. They say sorry to the judges and the other dogs. They go home and do not talk to each other. They do not play with Max. They are sad and mad. Max does not understand. He thinks the cake was yummy. He licks his lips and wags his tail. He wants to play. He does not know why his owners are upset. He thinks they still love him. He hopes they will forgive him. He loves them too.
