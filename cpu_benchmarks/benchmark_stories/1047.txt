Once upon a time there were two friends who went to a classroom. They were both very excited to learn new things.
The teacher showed them lots of different objects, each one was special in its own way. The friends enjoyed learning about them.
At the end of the day, the teacher said it was time for sleep. The two friends said their goodbyes and went to their beds.
The next morning, the two friends went back to the classroom. Everything seemed different now, with the morning sun shining through the windows. It looked really beautiful.
The two friends spent the morning learning and playing together. They enjoyed their time in the classroom together, until it was time for sleep again.
That night, when they got into bed, the two friends were tired but also very happy. They had had a really wonderful day.
