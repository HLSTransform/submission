Tom and Lily were playing in the attic. They liked to look at the old things that their grandma had. They found a box full of photos. They opened it and saw many faces. Some were happy, some were sad, some were funny.
"Who are these people?" Lily asked.
"They are our family, I think. Look, this is grandma when she was little. And this is grandpa with a big hat. And this is..." Tom stopped. He saw a photo that made him tremble. It was a scary photo. It was a man with a big beard and a mean look. He had a knife in his hand and blood on his shirt.
"Who is that?" Lily asked, looking at the photo.
"I don't know. He is scary. Maybe he is a bad man. Maybe he hurt someone." Tom said, feeling scared.
"Let's put the photo back. Maybe he will come out of the photo and get us." Lily said, feeling scared too.
They quickly put the photo back in the box and closed it. They ran out of the attic and down the stairs. They found their grandma in the kitchen.
"Grandma, grandma, we saw a scary photo in the attic. It was a man with a knife and blood. Who is he?" Tom and Lily asked, still trembling.
Grandma looked at them and smiled. She hugged them and said, "Don't worry, my dears. That photo is not scary. It is just a photo of your great-uncle Bob. He was a butcher. He cut meat for people to eat. He was a good man. He loved you very much. He gave you this photo when you were babies. He wanted you to remember him."
Tom and Lily felt better. They looked at each other and laughed. They realized they were silly. They were not afraid of the photo anymore. They thanked their grandma and went back to the attic. They looked at the other photos and learned more about their family. They had fun.
