Tom and Mia are playing with their toy cars in the garden. They make noises like vroom and beep and honk. They have fun racing and crashing their cars on the grass.
But then, Tom's car stops moving. He tries to push it, but it does not go. He looks at the back of the car and sees a hole. All the fuel has leaked out. Fuel is what makes the car go.
Tom feels sad and angry. He throws his car on the ground and starts to cry. He wants to play with his car, but he has no fuel.
Mia sees Tom crying and feels sorry for him. She is kind and wants to help. She has a small bottle of fuel that she got from her dad. He uses it for his big car.
She goes to Tom and gives him the bottle. She says, "Here, Tom, you can have some of my fuel. Then your car can go again."
Tom stops crying and looks at Mia. He smiles and says, "Thank you, Mia, you are very kind. You are my friend."
He takes the bottle and fills his car with fuel. He tries to make it go, and it works. He is happy and says, "Look, Mia, my car can go again. Vroom, vroom!"
Mia is happy too. She says, "Let's play together, Tom. We can race and crash our cars. Beep, beep, honk, honk!"
They play with their cars in the garden. They have fun and laugh. They do not tremble. Tremble is what you do when you are cold or scared. They are not cold or scared. They are warm and brave. They are kind and friendly. They are happy.
