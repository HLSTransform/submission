Once upon a time, there was a smart temple. It was filled with happy people. Every day they would fold their hands and pray. They prayed for good things, like food, happiness and friends.
Then one day, something special happened. It was a very sunny day and all the temple people were outside. They saw a magic bird fly over them. The bird was so beautiful. It was white, black and green all at once.
The bird landed on the temple roof. The people were very excited. The bird started to fold its wings. The people started to clap their hands. The bird opened its wings and a beautiful rainbow filled the sky. The people were so happy.
And that's how the smart temple got its rainbow. The people all had big smiles. And from there, the magic bird went flying away.
