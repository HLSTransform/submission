Once upon a time, there was a little girl who liked to wander. She went to the park and walked around, enjoying the fresh air.
Suddenly she heard a loud thunder. It made her jump and she started to run. She ran to the pond and could feel the thunder in her toes.
When she stopped, she saw a disgusting sea creature in the water. It was slimy and smelled bad. She wanted to get away!
So she took one more look at the disgusting creature and ran away quickly. She never wanted to wander to the park again!
