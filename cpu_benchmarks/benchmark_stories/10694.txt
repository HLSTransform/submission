Once upon a time, there was a little robot. The robot was very tired because it had been working all day. It wanted to rest and recharge its batteries. So, the robot went to its charging station and plugged itself in.
However, while the robot was resting, a little girl came into the room. She didn't see the robot and accidentally slipped on some toys on the floor. The girl fell and hit the charging station, making the robot fall down too.
The robot was very upset because it had been knocked over. It was also worried that its batteries might have been damaged. But the little girl quickly apologized and helped the robot back up. The robot realized that accidents happen and it was happy to see that the little girl was okay. From that day on, the robot and the little girl became good friends.
