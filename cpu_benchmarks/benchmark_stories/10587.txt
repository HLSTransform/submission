Once upon a time, there was a bluebird called Toby. Toby was a very curious bird and always liked to explore new places. One day, Toby's friend, a rabbit called Sandy, asked Toby to go for a drive in the park.
Sandy said, "Toby, I'd like for you to come for a drive. It'll be fun!" Toby was so excited, he said yes right away.
Sandy and Toby hopped into the car and drove off. Sandy drove slowly as Toby enjoyed the view. Toby felt so relaxed, he shouted, "Faster, Sandy - I want to go faster!"
Sandy turned to Toby with a smile and said, "Ok Toby - I will support you and increase the speed gently, so it's still soft."
So Toby and Sandy drove around the park, going at Toby's desired speed. Toby felt so happy and content that evening, safe and secure with his friend by his side.
