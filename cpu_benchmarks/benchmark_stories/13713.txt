Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily went outside to play. It was very cold outside and the ground was icy. Lily slipped and fell down. She got a little hurt but she was okay. 
Lily's mom called her inside for a snack. She gave Lily some jelly on toast. Lily loved jelly! While she was eating, her little brother came in and started making noise. Lily told him to be quiet but he ignored her. 
Lily got upset and went to her room to play with her dolls. She forgot all about her little brother and enjoyed playing by herself. After a while, her brother came in and apologized. Lily forgave him and they played together with her dolls. The end.
