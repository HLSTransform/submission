Tom and Lily were playing with their toy planes. They liked to make them fly in the air and land on the port. The port was a big box with some holes and stickers on it. Tom had a red plane and Lily had a blue plane. They were having fun.
But then, Ben came along. Ben was a big boy who liked to take things from others. He saw Tom and Lily's planes and wanted them. He said, "Give me your planes, or I will break them. They are ugly and small. My plane is better." He showed them his plane. It was a black plane with sharp wings and a loud noise.
Tom and Lily were scared of Ben. They did not want to give him their planes, but they did not want him to break them either. They tried to run away, but Ben was faster. He grabbed Tom's plane and threw it on the ground. It broke into pieces. Tom cried.
Lily was angry. She loved her plane and her brother. She did not like Ben. She had an idea. She said, "OK, Ben, you can have my plane. But first, let me show you how it flies. It can fly very high and fast." She took her plane and threw it in the air. But she did not throw it straight. She threw it sideways, towards Ben's face.
The plane hit Ben's nose. It hurt. Ben screamed. He dropped his plane and held his nose. He ran away, crying. Lily picked up his plane and gave it to Tom. She said, "Here, Tom, you can have this plane. It is not ugly and small. It is big and strong. And it can fly very well." She smiled.
Tom smiled too. He hugged Lily and thanked her. He said, "You are the best sister ever. You are brave and smart. And you can fly very well too." They took their planes and went back to the port. They played happily. They did not see Ben again.
