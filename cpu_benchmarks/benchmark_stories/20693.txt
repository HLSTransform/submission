Once there was a girl named Jane. She was a very curious child. One day, Jane wanted to explore outside her house. She opened the door and passed through, stepping into the warm sunshine. She looked around and saw a big switch. It looked like one she had seen before, so she decided to give it a try. 
Jane stepped up to the switch and pushed it. Suddenly, a loud noise filled the air. Jane was scared, but also excited. She ran around to the other side of the switch and saw something magical - a river! It was beautiful and Jane squealed with delight. She quickly took off her shoes and socks and started playing in the water. 
But when Jane stepped out of the river, something was wrong. The switch had stopped working and Jane was stuck. She had no way to get back home. Jane was miserable and wished she had never gotten so curious. 
But then, a miracle happened. A giant green monster passed through and put his hand on the switch. It started working again! Jane was so relieved and she quickly passed through the switch and back home. She was happy to be safe and sound - and never ventured outside without her parents again!
