Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park with her mommy and daddy. One day, they went to a new park that they had never been to before. It was a big park with lots of trees and grass.
As they were walking around, Lily saw a giant statue of a dinosaur. She was so excited and wanted to climb on it. But her mommy said it was too dangerous.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a sour-faced man yelling at a group of kids for playing too loudly. Lily felt sad and scared. But then her daddy came up with an idea. He asked the man if he would like to join them for a game of catch. The man smiled and said yes. They all had fun playing together and the man wasn't sour anymore. Lily learned that sometimes people just need a friend to make them happy.
