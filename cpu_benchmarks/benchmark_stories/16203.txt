Once upon a time there were two best friends, Lucy and Jack. Everyday they would play together in the park. One day they went to the park, but something didn't feel right.
Jack said to Lucy, "Why are you so sad?"
Lucy replied, "My toe is not reaching the swing. I want to swing so badly but I just can't reach it."
Jack said, "Let me help you, I can reach it!" He ran up and put his arms out, and he reached up and grabbed the swing.
Jack smiled and said, "See, I got it!" He handed the swing to Lucy and said, "You can have it now."
Lucy smiled and said, "Thank you for helping me reach the swing." The two best friends hugged and laughed and continued to have a great time playing in the park.
