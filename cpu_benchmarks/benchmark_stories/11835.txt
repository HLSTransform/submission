Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Katie. She was so adorable, with her big round eyes and pudgy little hands.
One day, while she was playing in the garden, something caught her eye. It was a fluffy little puppy shaking in the corner.
Katie excitedly ran up to the puppy, and scooped it up in her arms. She snuggled the adorable puppy close, and smiled as it licked her face.
Suddenly, an old dog from across the garden started shaking and barking. Katie was worried, so she quickly put the puppy down. Then, Katie ran and grabbed the old dog's round and scruffy ball, and brought it over.
The old and young dog started to play together, and Katie smiled. Then, the puppy crawled back into Katie's arms, and the three of them went inside.
Katie was so happy and proud to be the proud owner of two such adorable and loyal pups. She knew that they were going to be the best of friends!
