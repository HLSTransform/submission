Once upon a time there was an old wise whale. Every day the whale would swim around in the ocean looking for food and friends, but no one was around.
At night, the whale would get tired, so it decided to sleep. But it didn't have anywhere to sleep, so it just floated where the waves took it.
For many weeks, the whale floated and slept without ever finding a safe place to rest. It was so lonely and sad.
But one night, something amazing happened. A small school of fishes swam up to the whale and showed it a place to sleep. The whale was so happy and he followed the fishes to a quiet, dark and warm cave.
The whale felt so safe and happy that he fell asleep right away. For the first time ever, the wise old whale felt safe and at home.
