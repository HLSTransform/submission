Andy was naughty but he liked it. He loved to explore and the jungle was his favorite place. He always wore his trusty hat and his backpack was full of snacks. His mama had warned him to be careful but that didn't stop him.
Andy wandered deep into the jungle until he reached a clearing. There, he saw a bright green frog on a rock. The frog seemed to be staring right at him, so Andy blinked and the frog blinked back. He couldn't believe what was happening.
He wanted to get closer so he cautiously stepped closer and the frog hopped off the rock. It hopped over to a tree and crowned itself with a big flower. It looked so majestic! The frog and Andy blinked at each other before it hopped away.
Andy was so surprised and excited he could barely contain himself. He wanted to follow the frog to wherever it was going, but he knew his mama would be worried. So, he said goodbye and made his way back home. He knew he'd be back to visit the naughty green frog someday soon.
