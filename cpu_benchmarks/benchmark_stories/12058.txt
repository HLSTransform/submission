Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to go to the beach with his family. He loved to play in the sand and watch the waves. One day, Timmy saw some people surfing. They were riding on the waves and having so much fun. Timmy wanted to try it too!
He ran to his dad and said, "Daddy, I want to surf like those people!" His dad said, "Okay, let's go rent a surfboard." Timmy was so excited. He rushed to the surf shop with his dad. They got a surfboard and went to the beach.
Timmy was a little frightened at first, but his dad held his hand and helped him catch a wave. Timmy stood up on the board and rode the wave all the way to the shore. He had so much fun surfing with his dad. From that day on, Timmy loved to go surfing with his family.
