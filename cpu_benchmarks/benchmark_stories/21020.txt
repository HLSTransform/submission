Jenny was feeling very glad. She finally got to have a haircut today. Her mom gave her tight ponytails with cute ribbons.
“Wow, I look amazing!” said Jenny with excitement.
Then she went outside to play with her friends. She ran over to her playmate and said, “Do you like my new haircut?”
Her friend struck in surprise. “It’s so beautiful! You look gorgeous!”
Jenny was so glad to hear her friend’s kind words. She beamed with joy and kept showing off her new haircut to everyone.
“I love it so much,” she said to her mom when she got home.
“I am glad you like it,” replied her mom warmly.
