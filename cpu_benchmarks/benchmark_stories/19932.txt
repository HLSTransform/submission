Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside, but it was very cold outside. The ground was icy and slippery. Timmy's mom told him to be careful not to slip and hurt himself.
Timmy decided to help his mom with her job. She asked him to scatter birdseed in the backyard so the birds could eat. Timmy thought it was a fun job. He scattered the birdseed all over the ground, and soon the birds came to eat.
After Timmy finished his job, he went back inside to warm up. He was happy that he could help his mom and the birds. Timmy felt proud of himself and couldn't wait to do another job tomorrow.
