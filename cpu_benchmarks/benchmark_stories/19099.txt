Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy was very sleepy and wanted to go to bed. So, he climbed up the stairs to his bedroom. 
But before he could sleep, he remembered that he had a toy car that he wanted to store away. So, he went to his toy box and put the car inside. 
Finally, Timmy was ready to sleep. He closed his eyes and drifted off to dreamland. The end.
