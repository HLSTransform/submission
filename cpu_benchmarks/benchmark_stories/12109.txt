Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the park to play on the swings and slide. One day, she went with her mommy and daddy to the park. 
Lily was so excited to play that she ran towards the swings. She was wearing her favorite shoes, but they were too big for her. Suddenly, she slipped and fell down. 
Her mommy and daddy rushed to help her. They saw that her buckle was broken and her shoe was loose. They tried to fix it, but they couldn't. 
Sadly, Lily couldn't play anymore because she couldn't walk with her broken shoe. She felt deaf to all the fun sounds of the park. She went home with her mommy and daddy, feeling sad that her day didn't end well.
