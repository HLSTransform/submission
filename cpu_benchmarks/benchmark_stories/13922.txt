Once upon a time, there was a noisy jet. The jet loved to fly high in the sky. It made loud sounds that made everyone cover their ears. The jet liked to see people look up and watch it fly.
One day, the jet found a small, shiny box on the ground. The jet wanted to keep the box, but it did not know what to do with it. So, the jet decided to bury the shiny box in the ground and hide it from everyone.
A little boy saw the jet bury the shiny box. The boy was curious, so he went to dig up the box. Inside the box, he found many beautiful toys that made him very happy. The boy shared the toys with his friends, and they all played together.
The jet saw the boy and his friends playing with the toys. It felt happy to see them share and have fun. The jet learned that sharing with others can make everyone happy. From that day on, the jet decided to share the sky with the birds and not be too noisy. The jet, the boy, and his friends all lived happily ever after.
The moral of the story is that sharing with others can bring happiness to everyone.
