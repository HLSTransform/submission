Ben and Mia are playing in the kitchen. They see a big file on the table. It has many papers inside.
"What is this?" Ben asks.
"It is a file. Mom uses it for work. She writes and draws on the papers," Mia says.
"Can we look at them?" Ben says.
"No, we can't. Mom says we should not touch her file. It is important and she needs it," Mia says.
But Ben is curious. He wants to see the papers. He reaches for the file. Mia tries to stop him.
"Ben, no! Mom will be mad!" Mia says.
But it is too late. Ben pulls the file and it falls on the floor. The papers fly everywhere. Some of them land on the stove, where Mom is cooking.
"Oh no!" Ben and Mia say.
They hear a loud ring. It is the smoke alarm. The papers are on fire. They smell spicy and bad.
"Help! Help!" Ben and Mia shout.
Mom runs to the kitchen. She sees the fire and the mess. She grabs a pot and pours water on the stove. She turns off the ring. She puts out the fire.
"Ben! Mia! What have you done?" Mom says.
She is angry and scared. She hugs them and checks if they are hurt.
"We are sorry, Mom. We wanted to see your file. We did not mean to make a fire," Ben says.
"It is okay, my loves. I am glad you are safe. But you should never touch my file or the stove. They are dangerous. You could get burned or hurt. Do you understand?" Mom says.
"Yes, Mom. We understand. We are sorry. We love you," Ben and Mia say.
Mom smiles and kisses them. She picks up the file and the papers. Some of them are wet and burned. She is sad, but she is happy that her children are okay.
She says, "I love you too. But next time, please listen to me and play with your toys. Okay?"
"Okay, Mom," Ben and Mia say.
They go to their room and play with their toys. They do not touch the file or the stove again.
