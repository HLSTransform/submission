Lily loved to read books. She had many books in her bookcase. She liked to look at the pictures and the words. Sometimes, her mom or dad would read to her before bed.
One day, Lily saw a new book in her bookcase. It was a book about animals. Lily liked animals. She wanted to read the book. She took the book and ran to her mom.
"Mom, look! A new book!" Lily said.
Mom smiled and hugged Lily. "Yes, it is a new book. Do you know who gave it to you?"
Lily shook her head. She did not know.
Mom said, "It was from your grandma. She sent it to you for your birthday. She loves you very much."
Lily remembered her grandma. She lived far away. She could not visit often. But she always called and sent gifts. Lily missed her grandma.
"Can we call grandma and say thank you?" Lily asked.
Mom said, "Of course we can. Let's go to the phone."
Lily and mom went to the phone. They called grandma. Grandma was happy to hear from them. She asked Lily how she liked the book. Lily told her she loved it. She said thank you. She said she loved her too.
Grandma said, "You are very welcome, my sweet Lily. I am glad you like the book. I hope it reminds you of me when you read it. I love you very much too."
Lily felt warm and happy. She was grateful for her grandma and her book. She said goodbye and hung up the phone. She hugged mom and said, "Mom, I love you too. Can we read the book together?"
Mom said, "Yes, we can. Let's go to your room and snuggle up."
Lily and mom went to Lily's room. They sat on the bed and opened the book. They read about the animals and their sounds. They laughed and learned. They had a good time. Lily was happy. She had a good mom, a good grandma, and a good book. She was a lucky girl.
