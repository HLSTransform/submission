Once upon a time, there lived a lively dove that loved to fly around. From time to time, the dove would fly to a nearby pond to get a drink.
One day, when the dove flew to its favourite pond, it saw something strange: the pond was all dried up! Even worse, the bottom of the pond was full of garbage.
The dove was sad to see this and then it started to think about why it was so important to value the environment. It heard stories of animals that couldn't survive because their habitats had been destroyed by careless people.
The dove realised that it was important to value the environment and decided to spread the message. From then on, the dove spread its message to anyone who would listen. 
The moral of this story is that everyone should value the environment and take care of it. Taking care of the environment is our responsibility, and it will help make sure that future generations can enjoy the beauty of nature!
