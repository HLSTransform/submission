Once there was a loyal little girl named Lilli. She loved to explore, and one day she decided to go find a treasure. She grabbed her favorite basket, filled with snacks and supplies, and off she went! 
When she got to the woods, she heard a strange sound. What was it? She slowly approached, and saw a large, mysterious box. Inside the box was something magical! It was a little blue bird. 
The bird was scared, so Lilli tried to calm it. She talked to it and offered it something to eat. Soon, the bird ate all the food in Lilli's basket. They became fast friends! 
Lilli was so happy to have made a new friend. She named the bird Treasure, because it was her most valuable treasure. From then on, Lilli and Treasure went everywhere together. They were the best of friends, loyal to the end!
