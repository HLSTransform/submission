Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends were playing hide-and-seek when they heard a loud noise. It was a big dog barking at them. 
Lily's friends ran away, but Lily was too scared to move. She knew she had to be careful around the dog. Suddenly, she remembered what her mom had recommended to her: if you ever feel scared, try to escape and find a grown-up to help you. 
Lily quickly ran away from the dog and found a kind lady who helped her. From that day on, Lily was always careful when playing outside and remembered to escape if she ever felt scared.
