One day, a girl named Sarah wanted to explore a new place. She entered a big building with lots of doors. She looked around and saw lots of people with uniform moving around. They noticed Sarah and smiled at her. The people were the staff. 
Sarah asked the staff for help. They showed her what was inside each room. She found a room full of books and toys. She entered the room and started exploring. She read some books and played with the toys.
 
The staff told Sarah that the things in the room would be very useful for her. She was happy and thanked the staff. She promised to come back to the room very soon. 
Sarah said goodbye to the staff. She left the building happy and excited. She was thankful to the staff for making her visit to the building fun and useful.
