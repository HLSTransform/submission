Once upon a time there was a bug. He was small and very fast. He liked to run and play in the garden.
One day, he saw a dangerous creature. It tried to steal something. The bug was scared, so he ran away.
But the creature was faster. It grabbed the bug and put him in a jar. The bug was stuck and scared.
Suddenly, a big and friendly animal came. He roared at the creature and took back the bug. Then the bug was free to play again in the garden.
The bug was so happy that he had been saved. He learned a lesson: never trust a dangerous creature.
