Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to run and play in the park with his owner, Sarah. One day, they went for a walk in the woods. It was very hot outside, and Max was getting tired.
As they walked, they saw a big gate. Sarah tried to open it, but it was locked. She looked for the key, but she couldn't find it. Max barked and jumped, trying to help. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was a truck carrying a lot of fog. The fog was so thick that they couldn't see anything.
Sarah and Max tried to run away, but they couldn't find their way back. They were lost in the fog. Max barked and barked, hoping someone would hear them. But nobody came. They were stuck in the fog, and they didn't know what to do. They wished they could unlock the gate and escape, but it was too late. They were trapped forever.
