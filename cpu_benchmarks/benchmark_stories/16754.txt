Ben was a boy who liked to play with cars and trains. He did not like to learn new things at school. He thought it was hard and boring. He did not listen to his teacher or do his homework. He only wanted to have fun.
One day, his teacher said they would have an exam. An exam was a paper with questions that they had to answer. The teacher said the exam was very important and they had to study for it. Ben did not care. He did not study. He played with his cars and trains instead.
The day of the exam came. Ben was troubled. He did not know any of the answers. He looked at his paper and felt scared. He saw the other kids writing and thinking. He felt alone and stupid. He wanted to cry.
Ben suffered a lot that day. He got a bad mark on his exam. His teacher was angry and sad. His parents were disappointed and worried. His friends did not want to play with him. He felt sorry and ashamed.
Ben learned a lesson that day. He learned that learning new things was not so bad. He learned that studying was not so boring. He learned that doing his homework was not so hard. He learned that having fun was not so good if he did not do his work. He learned that he had to try his best and be a good boy. He learned that he did not want to suffer again.
