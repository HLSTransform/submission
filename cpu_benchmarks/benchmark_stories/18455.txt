Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Bobby. Bobby loved to play in the forest with his friends. One day, Bobby and his friends went to play near a river. The river was very rough and Bobby's friends wanted to jump in, but Bobby didn't want to because he was scared. 
His friends tried to convince him to jump in, but Bobby resisted. He didn't want to get wet and cold. Instead, Bobby decided to play under a big tree. It was nice and shady under the tree, and Bobby felt safe there. 
While his friends were splashing in the river, Bobby played under the tree and had fun on his own. He found some acorns and played with them. When his friends were done playing in the river, they came back to join Bobby under the tree. They all played together happily ever after.
