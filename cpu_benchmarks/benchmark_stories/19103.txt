Once upon a time, there was a happy little boy named Jack. Jack loved to dance and he would dance all day long. One day, Jack's mom took him to the market to buy some fruits and vegetables. Jack saw lots of colorful fruits and vegetables at the market and he was very happy. But then, he saw a disgusting smell coming from a pile of rotten fruits. Jack did not like the smell at all and he covered his nose with his hand. Jack's mom took him away from that place and they continued to enjoy their day at the market. When they got home, Jack danced and sang a happy song because he had a great day with his mom.
