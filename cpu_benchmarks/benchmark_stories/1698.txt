Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had a big farm. He had many animals like cows, pigs, and chickens. The farmer worked hard every day to take care of them. 
One day, a little girl came to visit the farm. She saw how the farmer used his tools to take care of the animals. She thought the tools were very useful. 
The little girl admired the farmer for his hard work. She asked him if she could help. The farmer was happy to have some help and showed her how to feed the animals. The little girl was very happy to help and learned a lot about taking care of animals.
