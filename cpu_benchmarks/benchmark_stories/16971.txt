Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together. One day, they see a big bus on the street. The bus is yellow and has many windows.
"Look, Anna, a bus!" Ben says. "Do you want to ride the bus?"
"Yes, Ben, I want to ride the bus!" Anna says. "Maybe the bus can take us to the park or the zoo!"
They run to the bus stop and wait for the bus. The bus comes and stops. The door opens and a nice lady smiles at them.
"Hello, children, do you want to ride the bus?" the lady says. She is the bus driver. She is compassionate. She likes to help people.
"Yes, please, we want to ride the bus!" Anna and Ben say. They climb on the bus and find two seats. They are happy.
The bus starts to move. It goes fast and makes a loud noise. Anna and Ben look out the window and see many things. They see cars, trees, houses, and birds.
"Look, Ben, a bird!" Anna says. "The bird can fly! I wish I could fly!"
"Me too, Anna, I wish I could fly!" Ben says. "Maybe we can fly someday!"
They imagine they have wings and can fly in the sky. They pretend they are birds and make bird sounds. They have fun.
The bus driver hears them and smiles. She thinks they are cute and smart. She decides to make a surprise for them. She turns the bus to a special place. She stops the bus and says:
"Children, I have a surprise for you. Do you want to see something amazing?"
"Yes, please, we want to see something amazing!" Anna and Ben say. They are curious.
The bus driver opens the door and says:
"Come with me, children, and follow me. I will show you something that can fly!"
Anna and Ben follow the bus driver. They are excited. They see a big field with many colorful things. The things are balloons. The balloons are big and have baskets. The baskets have people and fire.
"Look, children, these are hot air balloons!" the bus driver says. "They can fly in the sky with the wind and the fire!"
"Wow, hot air balloons!" Anna and Ben say. They are amazed.
"Do you want to ride a hot air balloon?" the bus driver says. She is generous. She likes to make children happy.
"Yes, please, we want to ride a hot air balloon!" Anna and Ben say. They are thrilled.
The bus driver takes them to a hot air balloon. She helps them get in the basket. She talks to the balloon pilot. The balloon pilot is friendly. He likes to fly.
"Hello, children, I am the balloon pilot. I will take you for a ride in the sky. Are you ready?" the balloon pilot says.
"Yes, we are ready!" Anna and Ben say. They are eager.
The balloon pilot turns on the fire. The fire makes the balloon bigger and lighter. The balloon starts to rise. The balloon flies in the sky.
Anna and Ben are amazed. They see the bus, the field, the trees, the houses, and the birds from above. They feel the wind and the sun. They laugh and clap.
"We are flying, we are flying!" Anna and Ben say. They are happy.
They thank the bus driver and the balloon pilot. They are grateful. They have a wonderful day. They are friends. They like to play together.
