Billy was a little boy. He loved exploring outdoors. One day while he was playing he saw a track in the dirt. He grabbed his stick and started to poke it. He poked and poked until it made a little bump. Then he kept poking until he made a track. 
He kept poking until the track was very long, and then he followed it. He was so excited when he saw a rabbit peeking out from the other side. Billy got scared and ran back.
But he kept coming back to the track and poking it. He enjoyed it so much that he started doing it every day. He would poke the track, run around it and see what he could find. 
One day, he found a little mouse! After that, he started to poke the track even more. His mom was very proud of him, and she always smiled when she saw him poking and exploring the track.
