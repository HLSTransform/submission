Once upon a time, there was a little duckling. The duckling was very small and yellow. It loved to play in the pond with its parent. The parent was a big duck with feathers that were also yellow. 
One day, the little duckling got lost. It didn't know how to come back to its parent. It was very scared and started to cry. But then, the parent heard the little duckling's cries and came to find it. 
When the parent found the little duckling, it was so happy! The parent hugged the little duckling and took it back to the pond. From that day on, the little duckling never wandered off again. It stayed close to its parent and played in the pond all day long.
