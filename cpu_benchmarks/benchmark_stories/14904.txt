Once upon a time there were two friends, Billy and Johnny. They always played together and had a lot of fun.
One day, they decided to go to the park. When they got there, they saw something they had never seen before: a dead bird on the path.
Billy picked up the bird and looked at it. He asked Johnny, “What do we do now?”
Johnny said, “We should act fast to help the bird. I’ll get some tape.”
Billy used the tape to fix the bird’s wing. He thought to himself, “Maybe it can fly again.”
At that moment, the bird opened its eyes. It flew away and disappeared from sight.
The moral of the story is that, if you act quickly when someone or something needs help, you can make a big difference. Even if the situation seems hopeless, you can still save the day!
