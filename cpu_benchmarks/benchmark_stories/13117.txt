Once upon a time, there was a dull thing. It was so dull that it was hard to look at. The thing wanted to be interesting, so one day it asked a sack for help. The sack said “yes” and started to talk to the thing. After a while, the thing felt much better because the sack made it laugh and smile. The dull thing was now bright and fun. The sack and thing became very happy friends. They went everywhere together and even sang songs. The thing was never dull again.
