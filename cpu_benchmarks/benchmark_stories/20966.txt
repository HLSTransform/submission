Once upon a time there were two friends named Ben and Terry. They lived in a small town together and were very good pals. They both loved to play together and build things. 
One day they wanted to build something special and so they decided to make a peace garden. They planned and drew out the design of their garden with sticks and rocks. 
The two friends needed help and so they asked the neighbours to join them in making the garden. Everyone was happy to help and very generous. They spent the afternoon digging and planting flowers, herbs and trees in their garden and it quickly began to come to life.
“What shall we call it?” asked Ben, looking around the garden. 
“We could call it the Peace Garden,” said Terry. 
And so it was named the Peace Garden and it stood for many years in their small town, reminding them of their friendship and the importance of being generous.
