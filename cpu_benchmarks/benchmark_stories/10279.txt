Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint and make pretty pictures. One day, Lily wanted to paint a fancy picture on her wall. She asked her mommy if she could paint on the wall, but her mommy said no. 
Lily was sad because she really wanted to paint on her wall. She decided to sneak some paint and paint a fancy picture anyway. But when her mommy saw the painted wall, she got angry and told Lily that she shouldn't have painted on the wall without asking. 
Lily felt bad for not listening to her mommy, but she also felt proud of her fancy painting. Her mommy helped her clean the wall and they talked about how it's important to ask before doing something like painting on the wall. From then on, Lily always asked before painting on anything.
