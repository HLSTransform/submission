Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with glue and make pretty pictures. One day, Lily's friend came over to play. They started to make a big picture together, but it was difficult to stick all the pieces together.
Lily's friend said, "I don't want to play anymore. This is too difficult." But Lily did not want to give up. She said, "Let's keep trying. We can do it!" 
After a while, they finally finished the picture. Lily's friend was so happy and said, "You were right, Lily. We did it! I'm sorry I lied and said it was too difficult." 
Lily forgave her friend and they had lots of fun playing with glue and making more pictures together.
