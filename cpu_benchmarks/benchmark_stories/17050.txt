Once upon a time, there was a fat hunter. He liked to catch big animals. He had a big dog to help him.
One day, the fat hunter and his big dog went to the woods. They walked and walked. They looked for animals to catch. But they did not find any. They were very tired.
The fat hunter and his big dog found a nice spot under a big tree. They decided to sleep. They closed their eyes and slept. They dreamed of catching many animals. When they woke up, they went home happy.
