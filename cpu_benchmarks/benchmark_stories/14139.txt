Once upon a time, there was a queen who lived in a big castle. She included many things in her castle, like a great big bed. She also had lots of jewellery and dresses. Every day was very hard for the queen, because she had to work all day long.
One day, the queen decided she wanted to take a break. She went to a nearby park and there she saw something special. It was a big, hard rock. She was sure it had magical powers! With the help of the queenâ€™s magic wand, she was able to make the rock softer and more comfortable.
The queen was happy, so she took the rock home and built a throne out of it. She sits on the throne every day and takes a break from her hard work. She also included some cushions, so she could be even more comfortable.
The queen loved her throne and now takes regular breaks from her work. She is a very wise queen. The End!
