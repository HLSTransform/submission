Once upon a time there were two birds, a robin and a sparrow. One day, the robin saw a feather spinning on the ground and she asked the sparrow where it had come from. The sparrow said he didn't know, but he thought it was very modest.
The robin thought it was funny so she asked the sparrow if he wanted to spin together. The sparrow agreed and with a few flaps of their wings, they both began to spin. They twirled around in circles and laughed as the feather spun between them. 
When they got tired, they both decided to take a break. They looked at each other and giggled before they both said, "Let's do that again!" 
So they did, and they had so much fun spinning around and around.
The end!
