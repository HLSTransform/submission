Once upon a time, there was a lazy little boy who never wanted to help his mom. He would always sit and watch TV while his mom did all the work. One day, his mom asked him to help her clean up the house. The lazy boy didn't want to help and said, "I don't want to."
His mom then said, "I dare you to help me. It will make you feel good!" The lazy boy thought about it and decided to help. He picked up his toys and helped his mom clean the house. When they were finished, his mom pointed out how nice and clean everything looked.
The lazy boy felt proud of himself for helping and realized that it wasn't so bad after all. From that day on, he started helping his mom more often and became a better person. The moral of the story is that helping others is important and can make you feel good about yourself.
