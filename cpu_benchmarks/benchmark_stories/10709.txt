Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys in the bathtub. One day, she brought her toy ice cream cone and put it in the water. But then, the ice cream started to melt and she got sad.
Lily's mom heard her crying and asked what was wrong. Lily said, "My ice cream is melting! It's going to sink!" Her mom said, "Don't worry, we can put it in the freezer to make it hard again."
But when they went to the freezer, they found it wouldn't open. Lily's mom tried and tried, but it just wouldn't budge. Lily said, "Maybe we can ask Dad to help us open it." So they went to ask Dad, and he was able to open the freezer with a big smile on his face.
Lily was happy again and her ice cream was saved from melting and sinking. She learned that it's always good to ask for help when you need it.
