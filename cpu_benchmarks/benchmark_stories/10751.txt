Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to spend time with his mom. They liked to cook together. One day, they wanted to make rice for dinner.
Tim was very excited. He helped his mom put the rice in a big pot. But, oh no! Tim dropped the rice on the floor. Tim felt sorry. His mom said, "It's okay, Tim. We can clean it up."
They cleaned the rice from the floor. Then, they cooked new rice together. Tim was happy again. They had a yummy dinner. Tim learned that it's okay to make mistakes, and he was not sorry anymore.
