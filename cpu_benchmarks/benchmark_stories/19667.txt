Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jack. He was three years old and very curious. One day Jack's mommy took him to the train station. He was so excited! He had never been on a train before.
But when Jack got to the station he felt very confused. He didn't know what to do. He looked around and saw people running and carrying bags. Suddenly he heard a loud noise. It was a train arriving!
Jack watched as the train stopped and the doors opened. Then he saw some people leave the train, but he couldn't tell where they'd gone. How strange!
Finally, Jack's mommy took him on the train. She pointed to a seat in the back and said, "Sit here and don't move". Then she left the train. Jack was very confused. He had no idea what was happening.
The train started to move and Jack watched out the window as the scenery changed. Suddenly he noticed a strange smell. It smelled like something was rotting! Then he remembered his mommy telling him that he had to stay in his seat and not move. He was very scared but he stayed put.
The train ride seemed to last forever, but eventually Jack and his mommy arrived at their destination. Jack was so relieved to be off the train. He had been very confused, but he was happy to be with his mommy again.
