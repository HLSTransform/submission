Once upon a time there was a little duck who wanted to go on an adventure. But the river near her home was all dried up! What was she to do?
Then she saw a big puddle of mud and thought that it would be easy to swim in. She waded into the mud, felt the squishiness under her webbed feet and started to feed. She ate all kinds of bugs and small pieces of grass.
While she was enjoying her meal, she heard a voice calling out. It was coming from the other side of the mud.
"Hey, little duck!" said the voice. "Why don't you come over here? It is much easier to feed over here!"
The little duck listened to the voice and swam over. Sure enough, there were lots of worms and insects to eat! She ate until she was full, then happily flew away, feeling very content.
