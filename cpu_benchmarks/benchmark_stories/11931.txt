Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max loved to play in the park with his friends. One day, Max found a sausage hidden under a bush. He was so excited to have found it, but he didn't know who it belonged to. 
Max decided to keep the sausage for himself and ran away with it. But later that day, Max's friend, Lucy, came to him and said that she had lost her sausage. Max felt guilty and knew he had to give it back to her. 
So, Max went back to the bush and put the sausage back where he found it. When Lucy came back to the park, she was overjoyed to find her sausage. Max felt happy that he did the right thing and learned that it's important to always give things back to their rightful owner.
