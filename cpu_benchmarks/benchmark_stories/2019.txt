Once upon a time, there was a frightened little animal called Jim. Jim was very small and liked to hide away from people who might hurt him.
One day, Jim was walking around in the forest when he saw a big cane. He thought the cane looked very dangerous and began to get very frightened. He wanted to run away and hide, but the cane was too close.
Suddenly, the cane started to move and Jim realised it was a snake. The snake was moving closer and closer and Jim was petrified. He was so frightened that he couldn't move. 
Just as the snake was about to bite him, he closed his eyes and thought of his family. He realised that if something happened to him, they would all be very worried. Suddenly, he found the courage to turn around, face the snake and scare it away.
Jim learnt an important lesson that day: no matter how small or frightened you are, you can find the courage to stand up for yourself and protect your family.
