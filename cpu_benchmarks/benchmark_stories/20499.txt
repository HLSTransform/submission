Once upon a time, there was a whale who swam in the ocean. He looked for food, but couldn't find anything to eat. One day, he came across a little fish, who offered to help. The whale was very grateful, and thanked the fish.
The fish said he knew a place where the whale could fit. So they swam together over the waves, until they reached a big cave that was perfect for the whale. The whale thanked the fish and offered to give him a reward.
The fish said he didn't need any reward, but he did have one big wish. He asked the whale if he could take him for a ride. The whale was happy to do it, so he swam around the cave, taking the fish with him. The whale said goodbye to the fish, and swam off. The fish was very happy and thanked the whale for being so fit!
