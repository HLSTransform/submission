Once upon a time there was a cool jeep. It liked to splash in puddles. Every day it would go out and find the biggest puddle it could find. It would drive right in and splash its wheels.
The jeep was so happy splashing and spinning around. The people in the nearby town could hear the jeep's happy revving whenever it found a puddle.
One day, the jeep found the biggest puddle of them all. It revved its engine and drove right in. The splash was really big and it made the jeep feel so cool. People came out of the town to watch the jeep and its big splashes! 
They watched the jeep for a long time and it never seemed to tire of playing in the puddles. It stayed in the biggest puddle and kept splashing around! That cool jeep kept splashing until it was time to go home. Everyone laughed and clapped as it drove away.
