Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to bake with her mom in the kitchen. One day, Lily's mom put on her apron and asked Lily to do the same. But Lily couldn't find her apron anywhere! She looked under the table and behind the chair, but it was nowhere to be found.
Lily's mom asked her if she had seen her apron, but Lily shook her head. "I want to help you bake, but I can't find my apron," Lily said sadly. Her mom understood and requested that Lily wear a normal shirt instead. But Lily didn't want to get her shirt dirty.
Suddenly, Lily's little brother came into the kitchen wearing Lily's missing apron! Lily was angry and told her brother to give it back. Her brother didn't want to, so they got into a little argument. Eventually, Lily's mom intervened and helped them resolve their conflict. They all worked together to make a delicious cake, and Lily was happy to have found her apron.
