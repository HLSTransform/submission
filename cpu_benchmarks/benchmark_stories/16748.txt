Mira and Ben are twins. They like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can make towers, bridges, houses and more.
One day, they decide to make a big picture with their blocks. They prepare a lot of space on the floor. They look at a book with patterns of animals, flowers and cars. They choose a pattern they like and start to build.
Mira is patient. She follows the pattern carefully. She puts the blocks in the right places. She makes a beautiful butterfly with blue, yellow and pink blocks.
Ben is not patient. He does not follow the pattern. He puts the blocks wherever he wants. He makes a mess with red, green and purple blocks.
"Look, Mira, I made a dragon!" Ben says.
"That is not a dragon, Ben. That is a mess. You did not follow the pattern. You have to follow the pattern to make a picture." Mira says.
"I don't want to follow the pattern. I want to make my own picture. It is more fun." Ben says.
"But you are using all the blocks. I need some blocks to finish my butterfly. Please share the blocks, Ben." Mira says.
"No, I need all the blocks. Go away, Mira. This is my picture." Ben says.
Ben and Mira start to argue. They pull the blocks from each other. They make a lot of noise. They knock down their pictures.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to see what is going on. She sees the blocks and the pictures on the floor.
"What are you doing, Ben and Mira? Why are you fighting?" Mom asks.
"Ben is not following the pattern. He is using all the blocks. He is not sharing. He is making a mess." Mira says.
"Mira is following the pattern. She is boring. She is not letting me make my own picture. She is bossy. She is ruining my fun." Ben says.
Mom sighs. She picks up the book with the patterns. She shows it to Ben and Mira.
"Look, Ben and Mira. This book has many patterns. You can choose any pattern you like. But you have to agree on one pattern. And you have to share the blocks. You have enough blocks for both of you. You can make a picture together. It will be more fun and more beautiful." Mom says.
Ben and Mira look at the book. They see a pattern of a rainbow. They like the rainbow. It has many colors and shapes.
"Can we make the rainbow, Mira?" Ben asks.
"OK, Ben. We can make the rainbow. But you have to follow the pattern. And you have to share the blocks." Mira says.
"OK, Mira. I will follow the pattern. And I will share the blocks." Ben says.
Ben and Mira smile. They hug Mom. They say sorry to each other. They prepare a new space on the floor. They follow the pattern of the rainbow. They share the blocks. They make a beautiful picture. They are happy. Mom is proud.
