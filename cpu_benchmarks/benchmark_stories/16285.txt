Once upon a time there were two friends, Daisy and Jack. They loved playing together and one day, Jack had a great idea.
He said to Daisy, "Let's go to the beach together!" Daisy was very excited and said yes.
So, off they went. When they arrived at the beach, the sand was warm and the water was quiet and blue.
Jack and Daisy walked to the shoreline and looked out at the waves. Daisy noticed that Jack was looking down at his hand.
She asked him, "What's that in your palm?"
Jack smiled and said, "A tiny shell! I found it in the sand. I'm allowed to keep it."
Daisy smiled and said, "I'm glad you found it. It's our special beach treasure now!"
Jack and Daisy spent the rest of the day playing in the sand and collected more shells and treasures. When it was time to go home, they hugged and said goodbye, knowing that more beach adventures awaited them in the future.
