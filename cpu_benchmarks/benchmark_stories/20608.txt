Once upon a time there were two sisters. One had a purple dress and the other only had a blue one. The sister with the purple dress was jealous of her sister's and wanted it for herself.
So one night she waited until her sister was sound asleep and quickly put on the dress and snuck out of the house. She twirled and danced and felt so happy in the dress.
But then she began to feel tired and so sat down to take a nap. She fell asleep right there with the dress on holding it close and dreaming of happy days.
The next morning, the sister in the blue dress woke up and saw that her sister was gone and that her dress was missing too! She got very angry and worried and searched the house.
Suddenly, she spotted the purple dress in the garden and ran outside to get it. When she got closer, she saw her sister sleeping in the dress, looking so peaceful and happy.
She smiled to herself and decided not to wake her, instead she just covered her up and then went off to find breakfast.
