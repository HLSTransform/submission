Once upon a time, there was a cat called Stripes. Stripes was very frightened of needles. One day, Stripes saw a doctor take out a needle. Stripes was so scared that she hid under the bed.
The doctor asked Stripes, “Please come out of the bed. I need to give you a shot, but it won’t hurt.”
Stripes didn’t move and stayed hidden under the bed. She was still very scared of the needle.
The doctor smiled gently and said, “It’s ok, Stripes. I understand that you are scared. But I need to give you the shot so that you can feel better. Please come out.”
Stripes slowly came out from under the bed and stepped towards the doctor. The doctor gave Stripes the shot and Stripes didn’t feel scared or hurt. In the end, Stripes was happy that she faced her fear of needles.
