Lily liked to draw pictures with her crayons. She had a folder where she kept all her drawings. She was very proud of her folder.
One day, she wanted to draw a picture of her family. She took out her crayons and a paper and started to draw. She drew her mom, her dad, her brother and herself. She tried to make them look nice and happy.
But drawing was difficult. She could not make the faces look right. She could not make the hair look neat. She could not make the clothes look pretty. She got angry and frustrated. She threw her crayons on the floor and tore her paper. She yelled, "I quit! I quit drawing!"
Her mom heard her yell and came to see what was wrong. She saw the mess on the floor and the torn paper. She saw Lily crying on her bed. She felt sorry for her.
She picked up the crayons and the paper and went to Lily. She hugged her and said, "Lily, why did you quit drawing? You are a good drawer. You have a beautiful folder of pictures. Drawing is fun, but sometimes it is hard. You have to practice and be patient. You can't give up when it is difficult. You have to try again and again. Do you want to try again with me?"
Lily looked at her mom and nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She said, "Yes, mom. I want to try again. I don't want to quit drawing. I want to make a nice picture of us." She took her crayons and a new paper and started to draw with her mom. She felt happy and proud. She did not quit.
