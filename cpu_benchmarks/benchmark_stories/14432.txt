Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park near her house. One day, she saw a pigeon sitting on a bench. The pigeon was very pretty with soft feathers and a sweet face. Lily wanted to be friends with the pigeon.
So, she climbed up on the bench next to the pigeon. The pigeon looked at her and didn't fly away. Lily was so happy! She gave the pigeon some bread to eat and they shared it together. Lily thought the pigeon was the sweetest friend she ever had. From that day on, she would always climb up on the bench to say hello to her sweet pigeon friend.
