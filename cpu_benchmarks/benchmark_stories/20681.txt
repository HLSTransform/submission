Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted a panda. But pandas were not cheap, so the little girl could not have one.
The little girl asked her mom if she could have the panda. Her mom said she could try to raise money. The little girl was excited and set to work.
The little girl asked everyone she saw if they had money to give her. Some gave her coins, others gave her dollars. She also picked up cans on the side of the road.
Soon, the little girl had enough money to buy a cheap panda. She was so excited, she danced all the way to the shop. At the shop, she found a cute, cheap panda and brought it home.
From that day on, the little girl and her panda were very happy together!
