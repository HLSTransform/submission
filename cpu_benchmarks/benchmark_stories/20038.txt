Anna liked to play dress-up with her mom's clothes. She found a big skirt in the closet and put it on. It was very long and dragged on the floor. She wanted to make it shorter, like her mom's skirts.
She asked her brother Ben to help her. Ben had a ruler and a pencil. He said he could measure the skirt and mark where to cut it. Anna stood still while Ben measured the skirt. He put the ruler on her leg and drew a line with the pencil.
"Here, this is how short you want it," he said.
"Thank you, Ben," Anna said. She took the scissors and cut along the line. She threw away the extra fabric and looked at her new skirt. It was warm and soft and just the right size. She twirled around and smiled.
She ran to show her mom her new skirt. Mom was in the kitchen, making cookies. She saw Anna and hugged her.
"What a lovely skirt, Anna! Did you make it yourself?" she asked.
"Yes, Mom, I did. Ben helped me measure it," Anna said proudly.
Mom praised Anna and Ben for being creative and careful. She gave them each a cookie and a kiss. Anna and Ben were happy. They liked to play dress-up and eat cookies. They loved their mom and each other.
