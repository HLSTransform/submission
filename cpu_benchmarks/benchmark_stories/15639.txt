Lily loved ponies. She had a toy pony that she played with every day. She named it Sparkle, because it had a shiny mane and tail. Lily wished she could have a real pony, but her mom said they were too big and too expensive.
One day, Lily and her mom went to the park. There was a big field with some ponies and a man. The man said he would let the children ride the ponies for some money. Lily was very excited. She ran to the man and asked, "Can I ride a pony, please?"
The man smiled and said, "Sure, little girl. Which one do you like?" He pointed to the ponies. There was a brown one, a black one, a white one, and a spotted one.
Lily looked at them and said, "I like the spotted one. It looks like Sparkle."
The man nodded and said, "OK, then. That one is called Spot. He is very gentle and friendly. Come on, I'll help you get on him." He lifted Lily and put her on Spot's back. He gave her a helmet and a rope to hold on to. He said, "Now, you have to hold on tight and listen to me. I'll walk with you and tell you what to do. Are you ready?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, I'm ready. Let's go, Spot!"
The man walked with Lily and Spot around the field. He told her how to make Spot go faster or slower, or turn left or right. Lily had so much fun. She felt like she was flying. She said, "This is the best day ever! I love you, Spot!"
The man smiled and said, "I'm glad you're having fun, Lily. But we have to go back soon. There are other children waiting for their turn."
Lily said, "No, I don't want to go back. I want to stay with Spot. He is my pony now."
The man said, "No, Lily, you can't keep Spot. He is not your pony. He belongs to me. You have to release the rope and get off him. It's only fair to share."
Lily said, "No, no, no! I won't release the rope. I won't get off. Spot is mine!"
The man said, "Lily, don't be stubborn. You have to listen to me. You have to release the rope and get off. It's the right thing to do."
Lily said, "No, no, no!" She held on to the rope and hugged Spot's neck. She was very persistent. She did not want to let go of her pony.
The man said, "Lily, please. You're making a scene. You're upsetting Spot and the other ponies. You're being rude to the other children. You have to release the rope and get off. Now."
Lily said, "No, no, no!" She started to cry. She did not care about anything else. She only wanted her pony.
The man said, "Lily, this is enough. You have to release the rope and get off. Or I'll have to make you."
Lily said, "No, no, no!" She screamed and kicked. She did not want to release the rope and get off.
The man said, "OK, then. You leave me no choice." He grabbed the rope and pulled it hard. He made Lily release the rope and get off. He said, "There. That's better. Now, say goodbye to Spot and thank him for the ride."
Lily said, "No, no, no!" She was very angry and sad. She did not want to say goodbye to Spot or thank him for the ride. She wanted her pony.
The man said, "Lily, stop it. You're being very naughty. You have to say goodbye to Spot and thank him for the ride. Or I'll tell your mom."
Lily said, "No, no, no!" She did not want to say goodbye to Spot or thank him for the ride. She did not care about her mom.
The man said, "Lily, this is your last chance. Say goodbye to Spot and thank him for the ride. Or I'll tell your mom and you'll be in big trouble."
Lily said, "No, no, no!" She did not want to say goodbye to Spot or thank him for the ride. She did not care about being in big trouble.
The man said, "OK, then. You asked for it." He called Lily's mom and told her what happened. He said, "Your daughter is very persistent. She did not want to release the rope and get off the pony. She did not want
