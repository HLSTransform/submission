Once there was an old woman who was very shy. She lived in a little cozy cottage with lots of colorful threads in the corner.
One day, a small girl named Lucy came to visit her. She had a big smile on her face, and the old woman couldn't help but be happy. She said, "Come in, Lucy, and have some tea!"
Lucy followed the woman into the kitchen, and the old woman asked, "What can I do for you today, my dear?"
"I want to make a pretty necklace with the colorful threads!" said Lucy. The old woman showed her the threads and helped her make the necklace.
As the old woman and Lucy worked, they both began to talk. The old woman wasn't so shy now, and the two talked until it was dark outside.
In the end, the old woman made Lucy a pretty necklace with the colorful threads. Lucy thanked her and said goodbye.
The old woman felt wonderful as she watched Lucy leave. She wasn't so shy anymore, and she had made a friend.
