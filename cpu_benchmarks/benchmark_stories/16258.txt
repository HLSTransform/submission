Once upon a time, there was a fat cat. The cat wanted to climb up a tall tree. But it was too tough for the cat. So the cat had a plan. The cat found a hook on the ground and hoped it would help her climb the tree. 
The cat grabbed the hook in her mouth and started to climb the tree. She hooked the hook on different places and steadily went up, higher and higher. Finally, the cat made it to the top. She was so excited, she started to purr. 
The cat looked around, and saw that she was now at the tallest tree in the forest. She could see the sun, birds and other animals. She felt happy of her success. 
The moral of the story is if you work hard and never give up, you can reach the top.
