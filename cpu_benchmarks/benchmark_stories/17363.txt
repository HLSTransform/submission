Sam and Lily were friends who liked to play outside. One day, it rained a lot and they saw many puddles on the ground. They put on their boots and ran to the biggest puddle they could find.
"Let's make a splash!" Sam said, and jumped into the puddle with a loud noise. Lily laughed and followed him. They had fun making waves and splashing each other with water.
But then, they saw a little bird on the edge of the puddle. It was wet and cold and looked sad. Lily felt sorry for the bird and wanted to help it.
"Sam, look at the bird. It needs our help. Can we be compassionate and share our towel with it?" Lily asked.
Sam looked at the bird and shook his head. He did not care about the bird. He only wanted to play in the puddle.
"No, Lily. The bird is not our friend. The towel is ours. Go away, bird!" Sam said, and kicked some water at the bird.
The bird was scared and hurt by the water. It tried to fly away, but it was too weak. It fell into the puddle and drowned.
Lily saw what happened and cried. She was angry and sad at Sam. She ran to the bird and tried to save it, but it was too late. The bird was gone.
"Sam, you are mean and selfish! You killed the bird! I don't want to play with you anymore!" Lily said, and ran away from Sam.
Sam was left alone in the puddle. He felt bad and sorry for what he did. He wished he had been compassionate and kind to the bird. But it was too late. He had no friend and no bird. He had only a puddle.
