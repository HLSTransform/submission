Once upon a time, there was a duck who wanted to sail away. He made a little sailboat and put it in the water. He waved goodbye and set off.
The duck sailed up and down the lake. He said hello to the fish and the other animals. Then he decided to try and swim. He was very weak but he tried his best.
The duck swam around the lake and the nearby river. He felt so free and so happy. He even splashed some water with his wings.
After a while, the duck was too tired to swim any more. He sailed back to the lake and hopped back into his boat. Then he waved goodbye to the lake and sailed away!
