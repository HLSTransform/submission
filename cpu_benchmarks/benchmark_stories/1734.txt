Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the color purple and had a toy mine that she played with every day. One day, Lily's friend Sarah came to play with her. Sarah also liked the color purple and wanted to play with Lily's toy mine.
Lily said, "No, that's mine. I don't want to share it."
Sarah felt sad and said, "But I want to play with it too."
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I have a plan. Let's take turns playing with it. You can play with it first, and then I'll play with it."
Sarah smiled and said, "That's a great plan!" 
Lily and Sarah took turns playing with the toy mine and had a lot of fun together. They learned that sharing is important and makes everyone happy.
