Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there was a graceful bird named Betty. Betty loved to sing and dance. One day, she met a little bunny named Bobby. Bobby had a worry. He was lost and could not find his way home.
Betty wanted to help Bobby. She asked the trees, the flowers, and the other animals if they knew where Bobby's home was. No one had the answer. Betty did not give up. She knew that she could find the answer if she kept asking.
Finally, they met a wise old owl. The owl listened to Betty and Bobby's story. He knew the answer! The owl told them how to find Bobby's home. They thanked the owl and followed his directions. Soon, they found Bobby's home. Bobby's family was so happy to see him. They thanked Betty for her help.
The moral of the story is: never give up and always help your friends.
