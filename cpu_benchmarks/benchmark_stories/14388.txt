Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Benny. Benny loved to play in the forest with his friends. One day, Benny's mommy warned him that he should be careful while playing because the world can be a dangerous place. 
Benny didn't listen to his mommy and continued to play without any worries. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise and saw a big tree falling down. Benny was very scared and realized that his mommy was right. He was lucky to be safe because he was not sleepy and was able to run away quickly. 
From that day on, Benny listened to his mommy's warnings and was always careful while playing. He learned that it's important to be aware of the world around you and to not take unnecessary risks. Benny was happy that he learned this lesson and was able to continue to have fun with his friends while staying safe.
