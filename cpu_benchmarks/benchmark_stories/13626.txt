Tom and Anna were twins who liked to play in the forest. They saw many trees and animals and flowers. They had fun and were happy.
One day, they found a big pile of lumber near a cabin. Lumber is wood that people cut from trees. Tom and Anna wanted to build something with the lumber. They thought it would be fun.
But a man came out of the cabin and saw them. He was angry and shouted at them. "Hey, you kids! Get away from my lumber! That's mine! I need it to fix my cabin!"
Tom and Anna were scared and ran away. They felt sad and sorry. They did not know that the lumber belonged to someone.
They ran back to their home and told their mom what happened. Their mom hugged them and said, "I'm glad you are safe. But you should not touch things that are not yours. That is not nice. You should ask before you use something. And you should believe people when they tell you the truth."
Tom and Anna nodded and said, "We are sorry, mom. We learned our lesson. We will not touch other people's things again. And we will believe them when they talk to us."
Their mom smiled and said, "That's good, my loves. Now, let's have some cookies and milk. And maybe tomorrow, we can go to the forest and say sorry to the man and his lumber."
Tom and Anna agreed and hugged their mom. They felt better and happier. They learned to be respectful and honest.
