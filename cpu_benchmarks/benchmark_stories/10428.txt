Once upon a time, there was a radish who lived in a tall tree in the forest. The radish was very brave and he wanted to explore the world. One day, he decided to leave the safety of his tree and went out on an adventure.
He soon found a carrot carrying a big basket. The radish asked to borrow the basket, so he could store his treasures. The carrot was happy to help and handed over the basket.
The radish continued his journey but soon he came across a dangerous river. He was scared, but knew he needed to cross it. The radish asked the frog if he could carry him across. The frog said yes and the radish hopped onto the frog's back.
The frog finally took the radish to the other side of the river and the radish said thank you. The radish stayed safe and he was able to go on more exciting adventures. He never forgot the helpful frog who helped him cross the dangerous river.
