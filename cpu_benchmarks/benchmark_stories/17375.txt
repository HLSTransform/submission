Lily was very happy. She was going to visit her grandma and grandpa. They lived in a big house with a garden and a dog. Lily loved to play with the dog and pick flowers in the garden.
She ran to her room and started to pack her bag. She put in her favorite dress, her teddy bear, her book and her toothbrush. She zipped up her bag and dragged it to the door.
"Mummy, I'm ready!" she shouted.
Mummy came to her room and smiled. "You are very fast, Lily. But did you forget something?" she asked.
Lily looked at her bag and thought hard. What did she forget? She had her clothes, her toy, her book and her toothbrush. She shook her head. "No, I have everything, Mummy."
Mummy bent down and gave her a hug. "You are a brilliant packer, Lily. But you forgot one thing. You forgot to say goodbye to your room."
Lily looked around her room and saw her bed, her toys, her pictures and her lamp. She felt a little sad. She liked her room. It was cozy and warm and full of fun.
She ran to her bed and gave it a kiss. She ran to her toys and gave them a hug. She ran to her pictures and gave them a wave. She ran to her lamp and gave it a wink.
"Goodbye, room. I will miss you. But I will come back soon. I love you, room." she said.
Mummy took her hand and led her to the car. "That was very nice, Lily. Your room loves you too. And so do I. And so do grandma and grandpa. Are you ready to go?"
Lily nodded and smiled. She was ready to go. She was excited to see grandma and grandpa and the dog and the garden. She was happy. She climbed into the car and buckled her seat belt.
"Let's go, Mummy!" she said.
