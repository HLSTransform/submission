Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big brother named Max who loved to play with machines. One day, Max showed Lily a machine that could make yummy ice cream. Lily admired the machine and asked Max if she could try it.
Max said, "Sure, but be careful. If you press the wrong button, the machine might be dead."
Lily was very careful and pressed the right button. The machine started to make delicious ice cream. Lily was so happy and said to Max, "I admire your machine. It's amazing!"
Max smiled and said, "I'm glad you like it, Lily. Now let's enjoy our ice cream together!"
