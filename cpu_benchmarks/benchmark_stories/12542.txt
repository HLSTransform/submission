Lily liked to go to the zoo with her mom and dad. She liked to see all the animals, but her favorite was the seal. The seal was friendly and liked to play. He would splash in the water and make funny noises. Lily would clap and laugh.
One day, when Lily went to the zoo, it was raining. She put on her raincoat and boots. She did not mind the rain. She still wanted to see the seal. But when she got to the seal's pool, she saw that he was not there. She felt sad. Where was the seal?
She asked her mom and dad. They said that the seal was inside a warm house. The rain was too cold for him. He did not like the rain. He liked the sun. Lily wished she could see the seal and make him happy.
She had an idea. She took off her raincoat and boots. She ran to the gift shop. She bought a yellow hat and a red ball. She ran back to the seal's pool. She threw the hat and the ball over the fence. She hoped the seal would see them.
She was right. The seal saw the hat and the ball. He was curious. He came out of his house. He swam to the fence. He saw Lily. He recognized her. He was happy. He put the hat on his head. He played with the ball. He splashed in the water and made funny noises. Lily clapped and laughed.
The rain stopped. The sun came out. The seal and Lily had fun. They were friends.
