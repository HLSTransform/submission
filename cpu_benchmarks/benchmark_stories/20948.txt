Once there was a bear who was very bored. He wanted to do something fun but couldn't think of anything. So he decided to try and escape! He ran and he ran until he was very tired. He looked for a place to take a nap. He finally found a cozy spot in a cave, so he curled up and went to sleep.
When the bear woke up he felt much better. As he looked around he realised he had escaped! He was so excited that he ran and ran, much faster than before. He explored the forest and all that it had to offer. He found big trees, bright flowers and sweet smelling berries. He felt so happy and free!
Soon he had to go back home. He remembered how boring it was there, but he also had some exciting stories to tell. He knew that he wouldn't ever be bored again!
