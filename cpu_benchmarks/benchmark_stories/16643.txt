Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around outside. But sometimes, she didn't behave very well. Her mommy would say, "Lily, you need to behave and listen to me."
One day, Lily's mommy told her they were going to visit her grandma. Lily was very excited because she loved her grandma. When they got there, Lily saw a big clock on the wall. Her grandma said, "Lily, can you count the minutes on the clock?" Lily counted to sixty and her grandma was very impressed. She said, "Lily, you are so smart!" From that minute on, Lily felt very proud of herself and made sure to behave well during their visit.
