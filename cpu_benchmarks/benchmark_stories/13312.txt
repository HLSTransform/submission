Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, they were making rice for dinner. Sue's mom asked her to help pour the rice into the pot.
Sue said, "Mom, I can help you!" She picked up the bag of rice and poured it slowly into the pot. The rice made a soft sound as it fell. Sue's mom smiled and said, "Thank you, Sue. You are a big help!"
As they waited for the rice to cook, Sue and her mom talked. Sue told her mom about her day and how she played with her friends. When the rice was ready, they ate it together. Sue was happy she could help her mom and enjoy the yummy rice.
