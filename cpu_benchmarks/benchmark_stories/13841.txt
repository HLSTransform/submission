Once upon a time, there was a big rhinoceros. He was a little bit crazy. He liked to tell funny stories to his friends. His friends were a cat, a dog, and a bird. They all lived in a big green forest.
One day, the crazy rhinoceros told a new story. He said, "I can jump very high and touch the sky!" His friends laughed and said, "No, you can't!" The rhinoceros said, "Yes, I can! Watch me!" He started to run very fast.
The cat, the dog, and the bird watched the crazy rhinoceros run. He jumped high into the air. But he could not touch the sky. He fell down on the ground very hard. The rhinoceros was hurt and sad. His friends felt bad too. The crazy rhinoceros learned not to tell stories that were not true.
