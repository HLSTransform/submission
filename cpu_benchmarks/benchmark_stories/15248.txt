Once upon a time there was a cool bathtub. The bathtub was very exciting! Every day the bathtub would twist and turn. It twisted so much that it made the water inside twirl and swirl. All day long the bathtub would twist in fun ways. It was so fun to watch.
One day a little girl saw the bathtub and she wanted to twist too. She jumped right in and started to twist and turn with the bathtub. She spun around and around and felt so cool! She laughed and laughed as she spun.
The little girl kept twisting and the bathtub kept twirling. She had so much fun that she didn't want to get out. Finally she had to get out because it was time to go. She said goodbye to the twisty bathtub and went home with a smile.
