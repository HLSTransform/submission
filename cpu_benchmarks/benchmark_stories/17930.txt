John had a TV. He liked to watch it every day. It was very useful. He could watch cartoons and learn how to count. He learned how to draw and colour with it as well. He loved telling his friends all the things he had learned with the help of his TV. One day he decided that he wanted to help other people to use the TV too. So he invited his friends over and taught them how to use it. They were so happy to learn! From then on they were able to use the TV to its fullest potential. It was the best feeling in the world.
