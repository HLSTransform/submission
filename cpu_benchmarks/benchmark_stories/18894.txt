Lily liked to count her coins. She had a pink purse where she kept them. She got coins from her mom and dad when she helped them. She got coins from her grandma and grandpa when they visited. She got coins from her aunt and uncle when they sent her cards. She had many coins in her purse.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a boy playing with a ball. The ball was old and rough. It had holes and dirt on it. The boy looked sad. Lily wanted to play with him, but she was shy. She watched him from a bench.
Lily had an idea. She opened her purse and took out some coins. She walked to the boy and said, "Hi, I'm Lily. Do you want to play with me?" The boy looked up and smiled. He said, "Hi, I'm Ben. Sure, I want to play with you." Lily gave him some coins and said, "Here, you can buy a new ball. Your ball is rough and bad. A new ball is smooth and good." Ben was surprised and happy. He said, "Thank you, Lily. You are very kind. How did you get so many coins?" Lily said, "I count them every day. I get them from my family. They love me and I love them." Ben said, "I don't have a family. I live in a home with other kids. They don't give me coins. They don't love me." Lily felt sorry for Ben. She said, "I'm sorry, Ben. That's not fair. You deserve to be loved. You can be my friend. I will share my coins with you. I will love you." Ben hugged Lily and said, "Thank you, Lily. You are the best friend I ever had. I will love you too."
Lily and Ben played with the new ball. They had fun and laughed. Lily's mom watched them and smiled. She was proud of Lily. She said, "Lily, you did a good thing. You shared your coins with Ben. You made him happy. You showed him kindness. You are a good girl." Lily said, "Thank you, mom. I learned from you. You always share with me. You always make me happy. You always show me kindness. You are a good mom." Lily's mom hugged Lily and said, "I love you, Lily. You are my treasure." Lily said, "I love you, mom. You are my treasure too."
The moral of the story is: Sharing is caring. Kindness is priceless. Love is the greatest treasure.
