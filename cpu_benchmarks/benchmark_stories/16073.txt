Once, there was an enormous box. Inside it, the world was waiting to be unpacked. One day, a little girl wanted to explore what was in the box, so she opened it. What she saw was amazing! She uncovered a world that was full of colors and shapes. She had never seen anything like it before.
The little girl spent all day playing in this world, unpacking different colors and objects until the box was empty. When she was done, she couldn't believe her eyes! This world was bigger than anything she had ever imagined. She had created an enormous world from that little box.
As the little girl explored her new world further, she noticed something strange. She could hear sounds coming from the box which had been empty a moment ago! She quickly returned and started unpacking the box again. To her surprise, this time the box contained tiny creatures that moved around and made noises. She knew right away, she had discovered something special!
