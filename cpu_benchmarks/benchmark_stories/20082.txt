Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with marbles. He had a big bag of marbles that he would play with every day. One day, Timmy's mom suggested that he clean his marbles. Timmy didn't want to clean his marbles because he thought it was boring. But his mom said that it was important to keep his marbles clean so that they would last a long time. So, Timmy took out all of his marbles and cleaned them one by one. When he was finished, his marbles looked shiny and new again. Timmy was happy that he listened to his mom's suggestion and cleaned his marbles.
