Peter had a party with all of his friends. He was very honest and everyone had a great time. During the party the friends decided to separate into two groups. One group played tag while the other group made a big blanket fort.
Peter and his group made the most amazing blanket fort. They used blankets, chairs and cushions to build it. The fort was so big that everyone fit inside. 
Once the fort was finished all of the kids rushed inside and had so much fun, they all laughed and played together. It was so much fun that they forgot to separate back into the two groups! 
At the end of the day, Peter thanked all of his friends for coming to the party and said goodbye. Everyone promises to visit again soon and Peter said goodbye with a big smile.
