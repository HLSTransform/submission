Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to hop around in the grass and eat carrots. One day, Benny met a bossy squirrel named Sammy.
"Hey Benny, you should pass me one of those carrots," said Sammy.
Benny didn't like how bossy Sammy was, but he didn't want to be mean. So, he passed Sammy a carrot.
But as soon as Sammy took a bite of the carrot, he made a face and said, "This carrot is yucky! I don't like it."
Benny felt sad that he had given Sammy a bad carrot. But then, he had an idea. He hopped over to a different patch of carrots and found the juiciest, sweetest carrot he could find. He brought it back to Sammy and said, "Here, try this one instead."
Sammy took a bite and his eyes lit up. "Wow, this carrot is delicious! Thank you, Benny."
Benny felt happy that he was able to make Sammy happy, even though he was bossy at first. From then on, they were good friends and Benny always made sure to share his best carrots with Sammy.
