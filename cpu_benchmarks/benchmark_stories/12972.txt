Once there was a large sack that lived in the sea. It was full of interesting things. One day a little fish swam up to the sack and asked, "What is that?" The sack replied, "This is my home.” But the little fish said, "I want to play with you!”
The sack was unhappy, because it was worried that the fish would get hurt. It said, "No, it's too dangerous in the sea. You must go away." But the fish refused.
In frustration, the sack said, "If you won't go away, I will have to push you away!" But the little fish was brave and refused to move. The sack had to push the fish away.
The fish was sad, and the sack felt bad. So the sack gave the fish a big hug and said, "I'm sorry, but it's not safe in the sea." The little fish nodded, laughed and swam away. The large sack was happy that it had helped the fish stay safe.
