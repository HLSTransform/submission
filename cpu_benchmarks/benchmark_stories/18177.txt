Once upon a time, in a small town, there was weird weather. The sun was hot, and then it was cold. The rain came, and then the snow. People did not know what to wear. They were sad.
One day, a little girl named Lily went for a walk. She saw a big tree with a small door. She opened the door and found a magic room. In the room, there was a big button. The button said "return."
Lily pushed the button, and the weather changed. The sun was warm, and the air was cool. The rain and snow went away. The people in the town were happy again. They played outside and had fun.
Every time the weather got weird, Lily would return to the magic room and push the button. The town was always happy because of Lily. They knew they could count on her to fix the weather. And they all lived happily ever after.
