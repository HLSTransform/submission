Once upon a time there was a nice swan. It lived by the lake. Every day it would swim in the lake.
One day the swan was flying around the lake. Suddenly, it lost its balance and fell into the lake. The swan splashed and kicked its legs to stay afloat.
A little nearby girl saw what happened and ran over to the lake. She asked the swan in a worried voice "Are you okay?"
The swan replied, "Yes, I am okay. Thank you for asking." And then it swam away. The girl was happy to see that the nice swan was safe.
