Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved cars and dreamed of having his own automobile one day. One day, Timmy saw a humble car in the street and he asked his mom, "Can we get that car, please?"
His mom replied, "We can't get that car, it's not for sale."
Timmy was sad, but his mom suggested they go to the park instead. When they got to the park, they saw a man fixing his car. Timmy went up to the man and asked, "Can I help you fix your automobile?"
The man was surprised and said, "Sure, that would be great!"
Timmy and the man worked on the car together and soon it was fixed. The man was so grateful that he gave Timmy a ride in his automobile. Timmy was so happy and thanked the man for the ride.
From that day on, Timmy realized that even though he didn't have his own automobile, he could still help others and enjoy cars in different ways.
