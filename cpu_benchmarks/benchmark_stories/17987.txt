Once upon a time, there was a cool cat named Tom. Tom lived in a big temple with his friend, a dog named Max. They played all day and had lots of fun. One day, they found a big ball in the temple. They both wanted to play with it, but there was only one ball.
Tom and Max started to fight over the big ball. They pushed and pulled, but neither could win. They were both very strong. Tom had an idea. He told Max, "Let's find a way to play with the ball together!"
The next day, Tom and Max found a long rope. They tied the rope to the ball and played a new game. They pulled the rope and the ball rolled back and forth. Tom and Max were happy they didn't fight anymore. They learned to share and play together, and they were the best friends in the cool temple.
