Once there was a young girl. She was three years old and liked playing all day. One day, she decided to use her useful lip and sell something. She went to the market and tried to sell her items. She asked people to buy their presents but nobody wanted to buy them. 
The girl was sad and started to cry. Suddenly, a lady saw her and felt sorry for the girl. The lady said she would buy her lip. The girl was so happy and thanked the lady. The lady said she could use the item to make something nice for someone else. 
The girl thought about it for a bit, and then decided to sell her lip for two treats. She quickly ran off to the store to buy some treats and soon returned to the market. She sold her lip and was so happy that she got something special for herself. 
The girl felt much better after her successful sale. She remembered what the lady said- that buying and selling could be useful. She used her money wisely and enjoyed her treats. From then on, she earned a little money by selling things at the market and was always happy for her successful sales.
