Once upon a time, there was a quiet little town. In this town, there was an old house. In the old house, there lived a kind man named Tom. Tom had a magic touch that could heal people.
One day, a sad girl named Lily came to Tom's house. She had a big boo-boo on her arm. "Can you help me?" asked Lily. Tom smiled and said, "Yes, I can heal your boo-boo." Tom touched Lily's arm, and her boo-boo was all better.
Lily was so happy that she told all her friends about Tom's magic touch. Soon, many people came to Tom's house to be healed. The quiet town was not so quiet anymore, but everyone was happy and healthy. The end.
