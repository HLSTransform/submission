Once upon a time, there was a clumsy bear. He lived in a small cave, but he wanted to travel. He opened the door and saw the outside world. Excited, he started walking around.
He saw a rabbit sitting near some green plants. "Hello!" the bear said to the rabbit. "Hello!" replied the rabbit.
The bear asked the rabbit, "Can you help me travel? I want to explore this world."
The rabbit smiled and said, "Sure, I can help you! Follow me, and I'll show you the way."
The bear thanked the rabbit and gladly followed him. The rabbit showed him beautiful places he had never seen before.
The bear was so happy with the adventure and thanked the rabbit again. Together, they opened the door back to the bear's cave.
The bear waved goodbye to his new friend, not knowing that this wasn't the only adventure he was about to have.
