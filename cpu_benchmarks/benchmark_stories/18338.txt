Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy lived in a big city with his mommy and daddy. They had a nice house with lots of toys to play with.
One day, Timmy and his mommy went shopping. They went to a fancy store with lots of expensive things. Timmy saw a shiny toy car that he really liked. He recognized it from a TV show he watched.
But mommy said it was too expensive and they couldn't buy it. Timmy felt sad, but mommy gave him a big hug and said they could go have ice cream instead. Timmy smiled and forgot about the toy car. He was happy to be with his mommy in the big city.
