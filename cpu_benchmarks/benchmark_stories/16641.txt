Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy car that was her favorite. One day, her friend Max came over to play. Max saw the toy car and said, "Can I play with it, please?"
Lily thought about it for a moment and then said, "Okay, but let me watch you play with it." Max happily played with the car and Lily watched him carefully. After a while, Max said, "Thank you for letting me play with your toy car, Lily. You are so helpful."
Lily smiled and said, "It's okay, Max. I'm happy to share my toys with my friends." Max smiled back and said, "You're a good friend, Lily. Can we play together again soon?" Lily replied, "Of course! The toy car is mine, but I'm happy to let you play with it anytime."
