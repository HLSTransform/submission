One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mommy. They saw a bee buzzing around the flowers. Lily said, "Mommy, can we get some honey like the bee?" Her mommy said, "Sure, we can buy some at the store."
When they got home, Lily's mommy made her a sandwich with honey on it. Lily said, "This is incredible! I love honey!" Her mommy said, "I'm glad you like it. Tomorrow, you have to study for your test at school." 
The next day, Lily went to school and her teacher asked, "Did you study for your test?" Lily said, "Yes, I studied a lot. But I also had an incredible sandwich with honey yesterday!" Her teacher smiled and said, "That sounds yummy. Good luck on your test!"
