Mum and Dad were walking in the park. Dad pointed to a rose bush and said, "Look, there is a rose."
Mum smiled and said, "It's so pretty."
Dad plucked the rose and handed it to Mum. She said, "It's so clean. I love it."
Mum then pointed to a bench and asked if they could sit down. Dad agreed and they sat down.
Mum leaned against Dad and said, "This is such a nice day, isn't it?"
Dad smiled and said, "Yes it is. We can enjoy the rose together."
They looked at the rose in Mum's hands and smiled. This day was special and they were happy.
