Once upon a time, there was a violin. It was delicate and shiny and it made a sound like no other. Every day, the violin rolled around the house, and wherever it went, it sang a happy song. 
One day, a little girl came to the house. She was three years old and she loved the sound of the violin. She followed it around the house, dancing and singing along. The little girl begged the violin to come and play with her. 
The violin could roll around the room and the girl could keep up with it. They rolled together, back and forth, and they had so much fun! The little girl laughed and the violin made music. 
When it was time to say goodbye, the violin rolled away, but the little girl still remembered the happy music it made. The delicate, shiny violin had made her day so special.
