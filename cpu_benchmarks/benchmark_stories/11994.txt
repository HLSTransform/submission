Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, Timmy's mom asked him to help her carry groceries from the store. Timmy was happy to help, so he hopped in the shopping cart and they went to the store.
At the store, Timmy saw a big, filthy dog outside. He said to his mom, "Look at that dirty dog!" His mom replied, "Yes, he needs a bath." They finished shopping and went back to the cart. Timmy's mom asked him to push the cart to the car. Timmy was happy to help again and pushed the cart all the way to the car.
When they got home, Timmy's mom thanked him for his help. Timmy replied, "You're welcome, Mommy. Can we play with my cars now?" His mom said yes and they played with Timmy's toy cars until it was time for bed. Timmy fell asleep dreaming of racing his cars in the shopping cart.
