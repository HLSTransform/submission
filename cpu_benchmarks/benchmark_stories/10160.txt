Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and make crafts. One day, she wanted to make a pretty picture with some glue and sparkly things. She asked her mom for help, but her mom was busy cooking dinner.
Lily got frustrated and started to cry. Her big brother, Jack, heard her and came to see what was wrong. "Why are you crying, Lily?" he asked. "Mom won't help me make my picture," she answered.
Jack said, "I can help you! Let's make a picture together." Lily was happy and they started to work on their project. But then, Jack accidentally spilled the glue on the table and it made a big mess. Lily got upset and said, "You're crazy! You ruined our picture!" 
Jack felt bad and said sorry. They cleaned up the glue and started over. In the end, they made a beautiful picture together and Lily was very happy.
