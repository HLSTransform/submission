Sara and Ben were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make fancy food. Sara found a big white cauliflower in the fridge. She wanted to make a cauliflower cake.
"Ben, help me cut the cauliflower," Sara said. "We need to make it small."
Ben took a knife and tried to cut the cauliflower. But it was too hard and he could not do it. He almost cut his finger.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Ben cried. "The cauliflower is too hard. I can't cut it."
Sara saw that Ben was hurt. She put down her knife and ran to him. She took his hand and kissed it.
"Don't cry, Ben. I will support you. We can make a different cake. How about a banana cake? Bananas are soft and easy to cut."
Ben smiled and nodded. He liked bananas. He hugged Sara and said, "Thank you, Sara. You are a good sister. I will support you too. Let's make a banana cake. It will be a fancy cake."
Sara and Ben put the cauliflower back in the fridge. They took some bananas, flour, eggs, and sugar. They mixed them in a bowl and poured them in a pan. They put the pan in the oven and waited for the cake to bake. They were happy and proud. They had made a fancy cake. And they had supported each other.
