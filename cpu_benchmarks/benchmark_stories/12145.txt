Once upon a time there was a girl named Sarah. She wanted to bring her sheep to the barn. 
Sarah said to her mummy, "I ready to bring sheep to barn?"
Her mummy said, "Yes, you can do it. Get your wagon and the sheep will follow you."
Sarah was so happy! She got her wagon and her sheep quickly followed. She brought the sheep to the barn and they were safe and warm.
Sarah said, "I bring sheep to barn. Now they can play." 
She was so proud of herself! She did a great job of bringing the sheep to the barn.
