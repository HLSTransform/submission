Once there was a little boy named Sam. One day Sam went to school and heard a really weird lecture. The teacher was speaking so fast that Sam could not understand anything. But then all of a sudden he saw something strange. He saw a little bird flying through the window and it was flying so fast! It passed over the teacher and Sam was so surprised. 
The teacher said "That was a very weird bird, but it passed quickly so we can continue with our lecture". The kids all laughed and Sam started to feel better. He stopped worrying so much and focused on the lecture. Soon he started understanding the lesson and he was very happy because he had figured it out.
Sam felt very proud of himself and he couldn't wait to tell his mom about the weird passage of the bird!
