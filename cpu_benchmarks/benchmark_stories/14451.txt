Once upon a time there was a group of zero friends who lived together in a rare house. They often wondered if they belonged in the house or not. 
One day when they were out playing they heard a voice coming from the sky. It said, "You all belong here, in this rare and special house together." 
The friends were so happy to hear this. From then on they never worried about belonging and enjoyed living in their rare home. 
The end.
