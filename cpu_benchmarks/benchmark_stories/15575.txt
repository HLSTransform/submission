Lily was confused. Yesterday, she had a big hug from her mom and dad. They said they loved her and they would see her soon. Then they put her in the car with her aunt and uncle. They drove for a long time and stopped at a new house. Lily did not know this house. She did not know the people inside. They smiled at her and gave her a toy, but she missed her mom and dad.
"Why are we here?" Lily asked her aunt.
"Your mom and dad had to go away for a little while," her aunt said. "They have some work to do. But they will come back soon. They asked us to take care of you. You can stay with us and play with your cousins. They are very nice."
Lily did not like this answer. She did not want to play with her cousins. She wanted to play with her mom and dad. She felt sad and scared. She started to cry.
"Shh, it's okay, Lily," her uncle said. He picked her up and gave her a hug. "We know you miss your mom and dad. We miss them too. But they are safe and they will call us every day. They will be very happy to hear your voice. And we will have fun here. We have a lot of games and books and snacks. You can choose what you want to do."
Lily sniffed and looked at her uncle. He had kind eyes and a warm voice. He reminded her of her dad. She hugged him back and felt a little better. Maybe this new house was not so bad. Maybe she could make some new friends. Maybe her mom and dad would come back soon. She hoped so. She loved them very much.
