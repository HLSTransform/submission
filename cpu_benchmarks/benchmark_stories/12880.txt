Once upon a time there were two people - a mom and a dad. They were very busy. One day the mom said to the dad, "Let's mix some things." The dad said, "What kind of things?" The mom said, "Let's mix different colors together." So they got out their special gun and chased through the house mixing colors together. They mixed red and blue and yellow and lots of other colors. The dad said, "This is fun!"
Next, the mom said, "Let's mix some music." So they got a different gun and danced around the house mixing music notes together. They mixed loud and soft and high and low sounds. The dad said, "This is the best day ever!"
The mom and dad continued to mix things together all day long. They mixed colors and music, food and clothes and more. When it got dark and the stars were out, the mom said, "Time to stop. Look at how much fun we had!" The dad said, "Yes! I am so happy we mixed together!"
