Once upon a time there was a charming little girl named Sarah. She was only three years old and loved to explore around her house. One day, Sarah decided to open the refrigerator, which had so many interesting things inside. 
When she opened it, suddenly a friendly voice said, “Hello Sarah, what can I do for you?” Sarah was so surprised she stepped back and looked around. 
“Who said that?” Sarah said. 
The voice answered, “I did, I am your refrigerator.” Sarah was so excited to talk to her refrigerator and asked, “What can I get from you?” 
The refrigerator answered, “You can get whatever food and drinks you like. What would you like?” 
Sarah thought for a minute and said, “Can I have a juice please?” So, the refrigerator gave her a tasty juice and she thanked it. 
Sarah and the refrigerator had a lovely conversation and she realized that the refrigerator was really charming. From that day onward, Sarah and her refrigerator talked to each other whenever she opened the refrigerator door.
