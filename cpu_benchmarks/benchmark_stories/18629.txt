Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to dig holes and play underground. One day, Benny found an original carrot that was bigger than any carrot he had ever seen. He was so excited to eat it!
But then, his friend, a squirrel named Sammy, came along and said he disagreed with Benny eating the carrot. "That carrot is too big for one rabbit to eat," said Sammy. "We should share it."
Benny thought about it and agreed with Sammy. They decided to split the carrot in half and share it together. They both happily munched on their pieces of the original carrot, feeling full and content. From then on, they always shared their food and disagreed less often.
