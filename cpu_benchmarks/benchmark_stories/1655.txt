Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to watch the motorcycles go zooming by on the road. One day, Timmy saw a big, shiny motorcycle and he wanted to follow it. 
"Mommy, can we follow that motorcycle?" Timmy asked, pointing to the shiny bike.
"No, Timmy. It's not safe to follow motorcycles," his mommy replied, feeling nervous.
But Timmy really wanted to follow the motorcycle. He thought it would be so much fun. Suddenly, the motorcycle stopped and the rider looked back at Timmy.
"Hey there, little guy! Do you want to come for a ride?" the rider asked.
Timmy's eyes widened with excitement. "Yes, please!" he exclaimed. And with that, Timmy hopped on the back of the motorcycle and they rode off into the sunset.
