Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat cereal for breakfast every day. He would pour the cereal into his bowl and add milk until it was ready to eat. 
One day, Timmy's mommy asked him if he wanted to own his very own cereal box. Timmy was so excited! He had never owned anything before. Mommy took him to the store and they picked out a box of his favorite cereal. 
Now, Timmy had his very own cereal box that he could eat whenever he was ready. He felt so grown up and proud to own something of his own. Every morning, he would pour his cereal into his bowl and eat it all up. Timmy was the happiest little boy in the world.
