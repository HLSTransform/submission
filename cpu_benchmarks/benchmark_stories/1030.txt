Once upon a time, there was a bear that wanted to find something good. One day, the bear decided to go on an adventure and arrived at a pond. As soon as the bear arrived, a frog hopped to the edge of the pond and asked the bear why he was there. The bear explained that he was there to find something good. The frog then pointed to a drain nearby and said it would be a good place to look. 
The bear was excited and cautiously arrived near the drain. To his surprise, he found an old carrot stuck in the drain. The bear was very pleased and used his big paws to grab the carrot. The carrot looked and smelled so good that the bear happily nibbled away. 
After finishing his snack, the bear thanked the frog for helping him find something good and said goodbye. He was so happy that he had found something delicious to eat on his adventure. The bear waved goodbye and embarked on a new journey.
