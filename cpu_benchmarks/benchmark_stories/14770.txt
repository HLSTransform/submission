Mira and Sam were playing with their blocks in the living room. They liked to build towers and bridges and castles with the colorful blocks. They were having fun and making a lot of noise.
Mom was in the kitchen, making lunch. She was happy to see her children playing, but she also needed some quiet time to finish her work. She had a modest job as a writer, and she had to send an article to her boss today. She asked Mira and Sam to play more softly, so they would not disturb her.
Mira and Sam tried to be quiet, but they still wanted to play. They whispered to each other and moved their blocks gently. But then, Sam had an idea. He wanted to make the biggest tower ever. He stacked more and more blocks on top of each other, until the tower reached the ceiling. He was very proud of his tower, and he wanted to show it to Mira.
"Look, Mira, look at my tower!" he said loudly.
Mira looked up and gasped. She saw the tower, but she also saw something else. She saw a big crack on the ceiling, right above the tower. The crack was getting bigger and bigger, and pieces of plaster were falling down.
"Sam, Sam, look at the crack!" she shouted.
Sam looked up and screamed. He saw the crack, and he saw the tower. He knew he had made a mistake. He had put too much weight on the ceiling, and he had disturbed it. He wanted to run away, but it was too late. The ceiling collapsed, and the tower fell down. The blocks flew everywhere, and the dust filled the air.
Mom heard the noise and ran to the living room. She saw the mess and the children. She was shocked and angry. She grabbed Mira and Sam and hugged them. She was glad they were not hurt, but she was also very upset.
"What have you done?" she asked. "Why did you disturb the ceiling? Why did you make such a big crack?"
Mira and Sam looked at each other and then at Mom. They felt sorry and scared. They did not mean to cause trouble. They only wanted to play.
"We are sorry, Mom," they said. "We did not know. We were just playing."
Mom sighed and shook her head. She knew they were sorry, but she also knew they had to learn. She decided to forgive them, but she also decided to teach them. She told them to help her clean up the mess, and to be more careful next time. She told them to respect the house, and to be modest with their blocks. She told them to love each other, and to not disturb each other.
Mira and Sam nodded and hugged Mom. They said they loved her, and they thanked her. They helped her clean up the mess, and they learned their lesson. They still played with their blocks, but they played more softly and more modestly. They did not disturb the ceiling, or the crack, or Mom. They were happy and good children.
