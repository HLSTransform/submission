Once upon a time there was a tiny angel. She was very small and her wings were green. Every day she flew around the world, looking for something to do.
One day, she saw a big pot of soup on the stove. It smelled good and made her stomach rumble. She flew down and landed beside the pot. Then she began to stir the soup with her tiny wing.
The soup began to steam and it started to bubble. The angel stirred and stirred until it was ready. Then she tasted the soup and it was delicious!
The angel was so happy and she flew away, with her wings glimmering green in the sun. The soup was the best she had ever tasted!
