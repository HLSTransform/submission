Once upon a time, there was a big, strong man named Tom. Tom had a huge hammer. He used his hammer to fix things in his town. Everyone loved Tom because he was always ready to help.
One day, a little girl named Sue saw Tom with his huge hammer. Sue wanted to help Tom, but she was very small. Tom saw Sue and said, "Sue, you can help me too." He gave Sue a small hammer. Sue was very happy.
Together, Tom and Sue went around the town, fixing things and helping people. The people saw that even though Sue was small, she could still help. Everyone learned that no matter how big or small you are, you can always help others. And that made the whole town a better place to live.
