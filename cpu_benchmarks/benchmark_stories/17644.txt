Once upon a time, there lived a happy little girl. Her name was Sally and she loved to learn new things. Every day, her mommy would give her a quiz to do. Sally always got excited to do her quiz because she knew it would help her learn something new.
One day, Sally was extra excited because her mommy had a special quiz for her. It was a quiz about zipping! Sally had never zipped before, so her mommy taught her how it was done.
First, Sally learned how to zip up her jacket. She was so happy when the zipper closed tightly on her jacket. Then, Sally learned how to zip up her backpack. She was giggling and laughing as she zipped up her backpack.
When Sally was done with her quiz, her mommy gave her a big hug. She was so proud of her daughter for learning how to zipper. Sally smiled and hopped off to go play with her friends. She was so happy that she had learned how to zip!
