There were two kids brother and sister who had gone to the ranch for a fun afternoon. They were really excited. As they explored the ranch, they saw a big red barn and quickly ran up to it.
The brother yelled to his sister "Let's play!" But the sister replied "Wait! I heard something!" 
They both stopped and listened. Suddenly, they heard a loud scream coming from the barn. The brother was scared, but the sister was brave and ran towards the barn.
The brother stayed back, afraid, while the sister opened the door to the barn. Suddenly, out flew a family of birds! The two were so excited and chased the birds around the barn. 
The sister gasped, "Look at the pretty birds". The brother jumped for joy, "Let's follow them". 
And so the two kids followed the birds, chasing them around the ranch. They screamed with excitement, and the birds flew with the wind. 
The brother and sister were very happy and had the best afternoon ever.
