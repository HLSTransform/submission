Tommy liked to whistle. He whistled all the time. He whistled at home, at school, and on the bus. He did not care if people told him to stop. He was stubborn.
One day, he whistled on the bus so loud that the driver got angry. The driver said, "Tommy, stop whistling or you will have to sit in the front seat with me."
Tommy did not stop. He whistled louder and louder. He thought it was fun to make the driver mad.
The driver got so mad that he slammed on the brakes. The bus stopped very fast. Tommy flew out of his seat and hit his head on the window. He felt a lot of pain. He started to cry.
The driver said, "I told you to stop whistling, Tommy. Now you are hurt and you have to go to the hospital. You are a very bad boy."
Tommy wished he had listened to the driver. He wished he had not been so stubborn. He wished he had not whistled so much. He learned a hard lesson.
