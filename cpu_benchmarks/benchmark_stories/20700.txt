Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. Sarah was only three years old and liked to explore the world around her.
One day, Sarah decided to go to the beach with her mom. Sarah saw the big waves and ran to the shore. She started playing in the sand and the waves washed it away.
But suddenly, Sarah got scared. She saw how the waves were getting bigger and bigger. Sarah started to worry and looked for something to hold on to. Then Sarah spotted an anchor and grabbed it with her tiny little hand.
Sarah held on to the anchor tight with all her strength. The anchor kept her safe, but the waves kept coming. Sarah was so weak and the anchor was so heavy!
Eventually, the waves calmed down and Sarah let go of the anchor. She hugged her mom and was happy that she was safe. From then on Sarah never worried when visiting the beach.
