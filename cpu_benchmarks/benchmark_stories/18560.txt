Once upon a time, there was a big bear. He liked to eat honey from a jug. One day, the jug was closed and the bear couldn't get any honey. He got very angry and started to fight with the jug. But the jug was too strong and didn't break. The bear was sad because he really wanted some honey. So, he asked his friend, a little rabbit, to help him open the jug. The rabbit was very clever and found a way to open it. The bear was very happy and they both ate honey together. They became good friends and promised to always help each other. The end.
