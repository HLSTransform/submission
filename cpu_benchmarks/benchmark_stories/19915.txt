Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie loved to sing and whistle. Every day, the birdie would sing and whistle in the forest. 
One day, the birdie saw a big, juicy worm. The birdie wanted to eat the worm, but it was too hard to catch. The birdie struggled and struggled, but it couldn't catch the worm. 
The birdie didn't give up though. It was persistent and kept trying to catch the worm. Finally, after a lot of struggling, the birdie caught the worm and had a delicious meal. From then on, the birdie knew that if it kept trying, it could overcome any struggle.
