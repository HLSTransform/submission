Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy pistol. One day, Timmy went to the park to play with his friends. They played hide and seek and tag. Timmy's friend, Johnny, found Timmy hiding behind a tree. Johnny said, "Wow, Timmy, you are a great hider! Let's applaud for Timmy!" All of Timmy's friends clapped and cheered for him. Timmy was so happy and proud.
