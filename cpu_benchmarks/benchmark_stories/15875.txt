John was a little boy. He had two shoes and wore them everywhere. One day he was walking outside when he saw a pigeon. The pigeon was big and fluffy with a grey and white pattern in its feathers. 
John said, "Hello little pigeon."
The pigeon cooed at him and hopped on the ground. It was a bit rough and John thought the pigeon might be lost. He looked around at all the buildings to see if there was anywhere for the pigeon to go. 
John said, "Do you need help? I can help you if you'd like."
The pigeon cooed again and then started walking. John followed to see what the pigeon wanted. Suddenly, the pigeon hopped up on a big building with a pond in the middle. 
John said, "Oh, that looks perfect. Have a nice home, little pigeon." 
The pigeon cooed one last time and flew away. John smiled and clapped his hands in excitement. He was glad he could help the pigeon find a new home.
