Once upon a time, there was a cute parrot named Polly. She was so colorful and fun-loving!
One day, Polly was sitting in her cage that was placed on a window sill. She could see the people outside walking, cars driving, and children playing. She wanted to join them, so she started to act.
Polly started to do funny things by flapping her wings, hopping up and down, and making funny noises. The people outside noticed and stopped to watch. They couldn't believe what they were seeing! They laughed and thought Polly was really cute.
One little girl couldn't help but marvel at Polly and her funny antics. She said out loud, “I wish I could take Polly home and play with her.”
At this, Polly stopped and looked at the little girl. Then, she made some cooing noises so that the little girl could understand. It was as if she was saying, “Yes, let’s play together.”
The little girl opened up the gate, hugged Polly, and took her home. From then on, they played together every day and made happy memories.
