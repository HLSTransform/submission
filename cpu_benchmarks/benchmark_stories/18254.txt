Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to put on her apron so she wouldn't get dirty. Lily put on her apron and felt very grown up.
Suddenly, Lily's daddy came in and said, "Hurry up, we need to go to the store!" Lily's mommy told her to stay in the kitchen and finish helping with dinner. 
Lily looked at her mommy and said, "I want to go too!" Her mommy said, "Not this time, sweetie. Maybe next time." 
Lily watched her mommy cook and noticed that her daddy's head was bald. She asked her mommy, "Why is daddy's head bald?" Her mommy said, "Some people just lose their hair as they get older. It's normal." 
Lily felt happy to be helping her mommy and learned something new about her daddy. She couldn't wait to tell him when they got back from the store.
