Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They saw a big basket under a tree. The basket was old and dirty. It had holes and rips. Lily and Tom were curious. They went to the basket and looked inside.
"Wow, look at this!" Tom said. He pulled out a shiny red car. It had four wheels and a horn. It looked amazing. "Can I play with it?"
"Sure, but be careful. It looks old too," Lily said. She found a soft yellow doll. It had a dress and a hat. It looked amazing. "Can I play with it?"
"Sure, but be gentle. It looks fragile too," Tom said. They smiled and played with the car and the doll. They had fun.
After a while, they heard a voice. It was an old man. He was walking to the tree. He had a cane and a hat. He looked sad.
"Hello, children. What are you doing with my basket?" he asked.
Lily and Tom were scared. They thought they did something bad. They dropped the car and the doll and ran to the man.
"We're sorry, sir. We didn't know it was yours. We just wanted to play," Lily said.
"We didn't break anything, sir. We were careful," Tom said.
The old man looked at them. He saw their faces. They looked sorry and honest. He smiled.
"It's okay, children. I'm not angry. You can play with my basket. It was my son's basket. He gave it to me when he was little. He had a car and a doll too. He loved them. But he grew up and left. He never came back. I miss him. I keep his basket to remember him. But it's old and dirty. No one wants it. It makes me sad," he said.
Lily and Tom felt sorry for the old man. They wanted to help him. They had an idea.
"Sir, we can help you. We can restore your basket. We can make it new and clean. We can fix the holes and rips. We can wash the car and the doll. We can make them shine. We can make you happy," Lily said.
"Really? You would do that for me? That would be amazing. Thank you, children. You are very kind and sweet," the old man said.
Lily and Tom nodded. They took the basket and the toys. They ran to their house. They worked hard. They restored the basket. They made it new and clean. They fixed the holes and rips. They washed the car and the doll. They made them shine. They made them amazing.
They ran back to the park. They found the old man. He was sitting on a bench. He was waiting for them. They gave him the basket and the toys. He looked at them. He was surprised and happy.
"Wow, look at this! You did it! You restored my basket. You made it new and clean. You fixed the holes and rips. You washed the car and the doll. You made them shine. You made them amazing. Thank you, children. You are wonderful and smart," he said.
He hugged them. He cried. He was happy. Lily and Tom hugged him back. They smiled. They were happy too. They made a new friend. They learned a new word. They restored.
