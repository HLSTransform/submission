Once upon a time, a cow entered a big, green field. She was looking for some food to eat. Suddenly, the most compassionate little boy she had ever seen came walking across the field. The little boy had the biggest, warmest smile.
He walked up to the cow, reached out his hand and offered her some kind words. The cow felt so happy and safe around the boy. Even though she wasn't sure what he was saying, it still made her feel good inside.
The little boy then opened up his bag and pulled out some delicious hay. He tossed it over to the cow and she was so happy! She gobbled it up and said thank you with a smile and a big moo.
The compassionate little boy smiled back and gave her a pat on the back. She then happily trotted off, feeling so lucky to have been welcomed by such a sweet boy.
