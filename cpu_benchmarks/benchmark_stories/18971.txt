Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tim. Tim loved to soar high in the sky. One day, he saw a big ball of wool on the ground. Tim was very curious about it.
Tim flew down to see the wool. He met a sheep named Sally. Sally said, "That is my wool. I lost it when I was playing." Tim wanted to help Sally. He had an idea. "I can take your wool back to you," said Tim.
Tim tried to lift the wool with his beak, but it was too heavy. So, he thought of using a fake beak made of wood. He put the fake beak on and tried again. This time, he could lift the wool. Tim soared high with the wool and gave it back to Sally. Sally was very happy and thanked Tim. They became best friends and played together every day.
