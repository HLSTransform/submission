Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and run around in the park. One day, she found a caterpillar and decided to take it home. She put it in a jar and watched it wiggle around.
Her mom came in and saw the jar. "What's in there?" she asked.
"It's a caterpillar," Lily replied. "I want to keep it and watch it turn into a butterfly."
Her mom smiled. "That's a great idea, Lily. But we need to test if the caterpillar can live in the jar. We don't want it to be frightened or hurt."
Lily nodded and they worked together to make sure the caterpillar had enough air and food. After a few days, the caterpillar made its cocoon and eventually turned into a beautiful butterfly. Lily was so happy and learned that it's important to care for life and not to be frightened to ask for help.
