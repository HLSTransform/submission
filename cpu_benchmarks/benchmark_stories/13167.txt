Once upon a time, there were two friends, Ben and Bob. Ben was sick and felt very poorly. Bob was worried about his friend and wanted to help him. He went on a journey to find something that would heal Ben.
One day he came across a strange loop. It was made of colourful strings and had magical powers. Bob stuck his hand inside, and it began to glow. He knew it must be special, so he took it with him. 
When Bob returned to Ben with the loop, he wrapped it around him. Instantly, Ben began to feel better. Bob was sure that the loop had healed him. 
Ben was so glad that he was feeling better that he jumped up and down and shouted with joy. Bob was so pleased that he had been able to help his friend heal. Together the two friends went on a lazy walk in the park and enjoyed the sunshine. 
 
The end.
