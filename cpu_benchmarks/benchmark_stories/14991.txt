Once upon a time, there were two friends. Their names were Sarah and Bill. Sarah had an idea. She wanted to borrow a towel from Bill.
Bill said, "No,Sarah. That is a dangerous thing to do." He was scared that it would be too difficult for her.
Sarah disagreed. She really wanted to borrow the towel.
"Please, Bill," she begged. "I just need it for a little while."
Bill sighed. He knew that Sarah really wanted the towel. Finally, he said, "OK, but you have to be careful. Towels can be dangerous."
So Sarah borrowed the towel from Bill. She was very careful, and she had a lot of fun with it. Finally, she returned the towel safely to Bill.
The end.
