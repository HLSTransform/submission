Tim and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toys in their room. But sometimes they fight over the toys. One day, Tim sees a huge sack in the corner of the room. He runs to the sack and opens it. He finds many new toys inside. He is very happy.
"Wow, look at all these toys!" Tim says. "They are mine, mine, mine!"
Sam hears Tim's voice and comes to the room. He sees Tim with the sack and the toys. He is very angry.
"No, they are not yours!" Sam says. "They are for both of us! Share with me!"
Tim does not want to share. He hugs the sack and the toys. He says, "No, go away! These are my toys!"
Sam tries to grab the sack and the toys. Tim pushes him away. They start to fight. They pull and tug and shout. The toys fall out of the sack. They break and tear and scatter.
Mom hears the noise and comes to the room. She sees the mess and the boys. She is very sad.
"What are you doing?" Mom says. "Why are you fighting? These toys are not for you. They are for the poor kids. I was going to give them away. You have enough toys. You should be kind and generous, not greedy and selfish."
Tim and Sam feel ashamed. They say sorry to Mom. They say sorry to each other. They help Mom to pick up the toys and put them back in the sack. They hug and make up. They learn their lesson. They decide to share their toys and be nice to each other. Mom is proud of them. She gives them a kiss and a hug. They are happy.
