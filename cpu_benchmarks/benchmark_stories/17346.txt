Anna and Ben are hungry. They want to eat something yummy. They look in the kitchen. They see a big pot of rice. Rice is boring. They do not want to eat rice.
"Let's plan something fun," Anna says to Ben. "We can make the rice into shapes. We can use cookie cutters and cheese and ketchup."
"Good idea," Ben says. "I want to make a star. And a heart. And a dinosaur."
They take some rice and put it on a plate. They press the cookie cutters into the rice. They make different shapes. They add cheese and ketchup to make them colorful. They are happy. They have made rice art.
"Look, Mom," Anna and Ben say. "We made rice fun. Do you like it?"
Mom comes to the kitchen. She sees the rice shapes. She smiles. She is proud of Anna and Ben. They have used their imagination.
"I love it," Mom says. "You are very creative. And you have planned a nice surprise for me. Thank you. Now let's eat your rice art. I'm sure it's delicious."
