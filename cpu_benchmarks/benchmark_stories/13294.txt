Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max loved to whistle. He whistled all day long. One day, Max went for a walk and found a filthy seat. He thought it was a good place to rest.
Max sat on the filthy seat and whistled a happy tune. A little girl named Lily heard Max's whistle and came to see who was making the lovely sound. She saw Max sitting on the filthy seat and said, "Hi there, little dog! I like your whistle!"
Max looked up and wagged his tail. He whistled back at Lily. Lily giggled and said, "You're so funny, Max! But why are you sitting on that filthy seat? Let's find a clean place to sit and play together."
Max agreed and jumped off the filthy seat. Together, Max and Lily found a clean spot under a big tree. Max whistled and Lily sang, and they played all day long. They became best friends and promised to meet under the tree every day to whistle, sing, and have fun.
