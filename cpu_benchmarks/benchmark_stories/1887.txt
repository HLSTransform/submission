Once upon a time there was a family who lived in a house. One day their sink started making funny noises and a small leak began. The father was very frustrated and he did not know what to do.
The father called the plumber to come and take a look. When the plumber arrived, he said to the father: "to fix this, I will need to add a few new parts to the sink". The father agreed and the plumber started to work.
After a few hours, the plumber finished and he said "all fixed". The leak had stopped and the sink was working again. The father was very happy and relieved.
He thanked the plumber and they said goodbye. The family went back to their happy life and they never had a leak again.
