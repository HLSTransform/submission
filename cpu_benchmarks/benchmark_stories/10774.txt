Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a big castle. She was not happy. She wanted to go outside and play, but she was not ready. She had a big dress and fancy shoes that made it hard to run and jump.
One day, she decided to talk to her mom, the queen. "Mom, I want to play outside, but I can't in this big dress. Can I wear something else?" The queen said, "No, my dear. A princess must always look her best."
The princess was sad, but she had an idea. She took off her big dress and fancy shoes and put on her play clothes. She ran outside and started to play. She was so happy!
But then, a big storm came. The wind blew and the rain poured down. The princess got very wet and cold. She ran back inside, but she slipped on the wet floor and fell down.
The queen was not happy. She told the princess that she should have listened and stayed inside. The princess was sad and knew she should have listened to her mom. From that day on, she always listened to her mom and never went outside without being ready.
