Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a messy cave. A small bear lived in the cave. One day, a tiny bird entered the cave. The bird was lost and scared. The small bear saw the bird and said, "Why are you in my messy cave?"
The tiny bird said, "I'm lost. I can't find my mom." The small bear wanted to help the tiny bird find its mom. But the bird was scared of the bear. The bird said, "You are big. I am scared."
The small bear felt sad. He wanted to show the bird that he was nice. So he said, "Don't be scared. I will help you find your mom." The tiny bird felt better. They both left the cave to find the bird's mom. Soon, they found her. The bird and her mom were happy. The small bear felt happy too, because he made a new friend.
