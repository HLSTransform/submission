Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to sail on his toy boat in the bathtub. One day, he asked his mom if he could sail his boat in the big lake. His mom said, "Be patient, Timmy. You're not big enough yet."
Timmy was sad, but he waited and waited. Finally, he grew big enough to sail his boat in the big lake. He was so excited! The day was perfect - the sun was shining and the water was calm.
Timmy sailed his boat for hours, but then the wind picked up and the waves got bigger. Timmy didn't know what to do. Suddenly, a big wave came and flipped his boat over. Timmy tried to swim, but he couldn't. Sadly, he drowned in the lake.
The end.
