Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to watch planes fly in the sky. One day, Timmy's mommy took him to the airport to see the planes up close. Timmy was so excited!
As they were watching a plane take off, Timmy saw a bird flying in the sky. He tried to catch it, but he couldn't. Then, Timmy started to spin around and around, and he got so dizzy that he fell down.
Timmy was sad because he couldn't catch the bird, but his mommy hugged him and said they could try again another day. Timmy felt better and they went to get some ice cream. The end.
