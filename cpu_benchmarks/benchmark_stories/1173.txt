One day, a little girl named Mia went for a walk in the woods. She saw a beautiful flower and wanted to pick it. But when she tried, a tiny spirit came out of the flower.
The spirit said, "Please don't pick the flower, it's my home." Mia felt sad because she wanted the flower, but she didn't want to make the spirit sad too. So, Mia asked the spirit, "What can I do to have a beautiful flower like this without making you sad?"
The spirit thought for a moment and said, "I can help you grow a beautiful flower just like this one." Mia was happy and said thank you to the spirit. They worked together to plant a new flower. Soon, Mia had her own beautiful flower, and the spirit still had its home.
