Once upon a time, there was a little girl. Her name was Jane. She lived on a farm with her Mama and Papa. Jane loved her farm very much.
One day, Mama and Papa gave Jane a new puppy. When she saw it, Jane was very excited. She named the pup Blue. Blue and Jane were soon the best of friends.
But not everyone was happy to see Blue. The chickens were very afraid of the pup. Whenever Blue came near them, they would run away.
One day, Jane and Blue were outside playing when they made a mess in the backyard. They had knocked over the pots and pulled out the flowers. Mama came outside and saw the mess. She was not happy. She told Jane to tidy it up. Jane tried her best, but it was too hard for her.
Mama saw that Jane was struggling. She came and helped her. As they were tidying up the backyard, Mama said "Jane, I recognize how hard you are trying. You are a very helpful girl."
Blue looked happy and proud too. Jane knew that her Mama recognized how much she loved Blue and how much care she took of the animals on the farm. With Mama's help, the backyard soon looked neat again.
