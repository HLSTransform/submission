Alice had a special mission. She was going to study at the park. She brought her pencil and paper, and was excited to find out what she would learn. She walked to the park and saw lots of different plants and birds. She wanted to know what each one was called.
Alice sat by a tree and started drawing pictures of the animals. She studied the the leaves and shapes of each one. She also looked at the colour of the feathers on the birds.
Alice noticed something else in the park. It was full of children playing and laughing. She soon realized that the park was a useful place to learn as well! She watched how the children played with each other and came up with games and stories of their own.
Alice was glad she came to the park. She had learned so much about plants, animals and making friends. Her day of studying had been fun and useful.
