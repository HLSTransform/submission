One day, a boy named Tim went to a restaurant with his mom. They were hungry and wanted to eat. The restaurant was big and had many tables. Tim saw a door with a lock on it. He was curious and wanted to open the lock.
Tim asked his mom, "Mom, can I open the lock on the door?" His mom said, "No, Tim. The lock is there for a reason. We should not open it."
Tim did not listen to his mom. When she was not looking, he tried to open the lock. It was harsh and hard to open. Suddenly, the door opened, and out came a big cat. The cat ran all around the restaurant, making a mess.
The people at the restaurant were not happy. Tim's mom said, "Tim, this is why we should listen and not touch things that are not ours."
From that day, Tim learned to listen to his mom and not to touch things that are not his. He knew that it was important to respect other people's things.
