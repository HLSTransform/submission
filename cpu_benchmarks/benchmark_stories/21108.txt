One day, a little animal was playing in the rain. It was a lot of fun, but soon the animal got wet and cold. The animal was upset and wanted to be dry again.
The animal saw a big tree and went under it. There, the animal met a bird who was also hiding from the rain. The bird said, "Hello, little animal! Are you upset because you are wet too?" The animal nodded and said, "Yes, I want to be dry again."
The bird had an idea. It said, "Let's flap our wings and shake our bodies to make the water go away!" So they flapped their wings and shook their bodies together. Soon, the rain stopped, and they both became dry. The animal was happy and not upset anymore. They both went out to play in the sun and became good friends.
