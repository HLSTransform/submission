Once upon a time, there was a huge nail. It was so big that it almost looked like a mountain. Every day, the nail was in the same place and never moved.
One night, when all the birds were asleep, the huge nail suddenly vanished! It was gone. No one knew where it went. 
All the animals searched and searched for the huge nail. They looked everywhere, but they couldnâ€™t find it. 
One day, a little bird flew over a tall tree and saw something shiny in a hole. As it got closer, it saw the huge nail! The animals were so happy to find the huge nail, and they never forgot that it could vanish.
