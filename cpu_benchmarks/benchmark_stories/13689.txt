Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He was very restless and didn't like to wear his clothes. One day, his mom said, "Timmy, put on your clothes or we can't go outside to play." Timmy didn't want to wear his clothes, so he said, "No, I don't want to."
His mom got upset and they started to fight. Timmy didn't want to give up, so he threw his clothes on the floor and ran away. He went outside without any clothes on and started to play. But then, it started to rain and Timmy got very cold. He ran back inside, but it was too late. He got sick and had to stay in bed for a long time. 
From that day on, Timmy always wore his clothes and never fought with his mom again. The end.
