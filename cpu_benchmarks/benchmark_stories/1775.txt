Jimmy was walking through the wide, open field. Suddenly, he heard a sound behind him. He shivered and quickly looked back. He saw a big, scary bear! Jimmy quickly turned around to run. The bear was roaring as it chased after him.
Jimmy ran as fast as he could, but the bear was much bigger and faster than him. Just as the bear was about to catch him, Jimmy saw a big tree with a hole in it. He quickly ran and jumped into the hole.
Jimmy scrambled to the back of the hole, feeling very scared and alone. Then he heard the bear passing by outside. He finally felt safe. After the bear had gone, Jimmy opened the hole and stepped outside.
He looked around the wide field, thankful that he was safe. Then, he quickly ran all the way home to his mom. Jimmy never wanted to go back there again!
