Lily was sad. She had a sour tummy and it hurt. She wanted to play with her dolls, but she could not. She lay on her bed and cried.
Mama heard her cry and came to her room. She saw Lily on her bed and felt sorry for her. She sat next to her and gave her a hug. "What is wrong, my sweet?" she asked.
Lily sniffed and pointed to her tummy. "It is sour, Mama. It hurts a lot. I want it to go away."
Mama kissed her forehead and said, "I know, my love. It is not fun to have a sour tummy. But it will go away soon. You just need to rest and drink some water. And I have something for you that will make you feel better."
She reached into her pocket and took out a small doll. It was made of cloth and had a red dress and yellow hair. It was Lily's favorite doll. Mama had made it for her when she was a baby. She had used a thread from her own dress to sew it.
"Look, Lily. It is your doll. She is here to comfort you. She loves you very much and she wants you to be happy. You can hold her and talk to her and she will listen. She will be your friend and keep you company."
Lily smiled and took the doll from Mama. She hugged it and felt its softness. She whispered, "Thank you, Mama. Thank you, doll. You are both very nice. I love you both very much."
Mama smiled and said, "You are welcome, Lily. I love you too. Now, try to sleep and let your tummy heal. I will be right here with you. And when you wake up, we can play with your dolls together."
Lily nodded and closed her eyes. She felt Mama's hand on her hair and the doll's warmth on her chest. She felt less sour and more comforted. She drifted into a peaceful sleep.
