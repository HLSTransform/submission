Tim and Sam are friends. They like to play baseball. They have a baseball and a bat. They go to the park to play.
At the park, they see a girl. She is sitting on a bench. She has a book. She looks sad.
"Hi, what is your name?" Tim asks the girl.
"My name is Lily. I am new here. I have no friends," the girl says.
"Do you want to play with us?" Sam asks.
"I don't know how to play baseball," Lily says.
"We can teach you. It is fun. Come on," Tim says.
Lily smiles. She puts down her book. She goes with Tim and Sam. They show her how to hold the bat and hit the ball. They take turns. They cheer for each other.
Lily likes to play baseball. She likes Tim and Sam. They are nice. They are her new friends.
The end.
Moral value: Be kind to others. You can make new friends by inviting them to play with you.
