Once upon a time there was a tiny bear named Max. He was always on a hunt for something special. One day, he had an idea. He decided to go on a secret adventure in the woods.
As he explored the woods, he came across a big surprise. It was a hidden cherry tree! Max was so excited. He wanted to be the first to pick the cherries from the tree.
Max had a great plan. He wanted to help the other animals in the woods. He suggested to the animals that they all take turns picking the cherries. That way everyone would have some.
The animals thought Max's suggestion was great! They all took turns picking the beautiful cherries. Everyone was happy and they enjoyed the sweet cherries together.
Max was glad that he had suggested that everyone had a turn. He was very proud and he went to bed with a smile on his face.
