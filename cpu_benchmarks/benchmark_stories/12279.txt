Once there was a mom and a dad and they had a little girl named Sarah. Sarah loved playing outside, especially in the garden. 
One day, Sarah wanted to play outside, so her mom and dad opened the gate for her. Sarah ran outside into the garden and began exploring. She saw a big, green hose and she picked it up. Mom and Dad had left the water on and, suddenly, water sprayed out of the hose! 
Sarah was so excited and she played with the spray for ages. It felt so fun and cool - it was definitely not boring! Finally, when she had had enough, Sarah's mom and dad put the hose away and closed the gate so she would stay safe in the garden. 
Sarah waved goodbye to the hose and then ran off to find something else to play with. After all, she was only three and she loved having fun!
