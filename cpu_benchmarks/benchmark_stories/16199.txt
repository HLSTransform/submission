Jimmy was playing with his toys when he realized that his dog, Molly, was outside. He slowly opened the door and saw that Molly looked filthy. A big shield was in front of her. 
Jimmy knelt down beside Molly and realized that her shield was broken. He knew he had to help. He carefully took the shield in his hands, and then Molly jumped up and ran into the house. 
Jimmy followed her and scrubbed her gently with a sponge. He saw that the dirt had gone away, and his dog was clean again! He hugged her and they were both very happy. 
Jimmy realized that it was important to protect Molly, and he promised to always be her shield.
