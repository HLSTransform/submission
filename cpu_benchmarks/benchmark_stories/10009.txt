Once upon a time, there was a cheerful little frog named Freddy. Freddy loved to hop around and play in the pond. One day, he met a little duckling named Daisy.
"Hi there," said Freddy. "Do you want to play with me?"
"Yes, please," said Daisy. "What do you want to do?"
"I want to follow you around the pond," said Freddy.
"Okay," said Daisy. "Let's go!"
So, Freddy and Daisy hopped and waddled around the pond together. They saw lots of fish and bugs and even a big turtle. They had so much fun together!
After a while, Daisy said, "I have to go back to my mommy now. Thank you for playing with me, Freddy."
"You're welcome," said Freddy. "I had a lot of fun too. Let's play again soon!"
And with that, Daisy said goodbye and waddled back to her mommy. Freddy hopped back into the pond, feeling happy and content.
