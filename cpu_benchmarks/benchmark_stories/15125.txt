Billy was very scared. He was walking through the woods, looking for something. He had a bag of salt in his hands. He stopped and looked around. He could feel something strange in the air.
Suddenly, he heard a voice. "Billy! Where are you?" It was his mom. "I'm over here!" he shouted back.
Mom walked up and hugged Billy tight. "What were you doing out here by yourself? You're so brave. You must have been very scared." She reached out and took the bag of salt from Billy's hands and smiled.
Billy smiled back at Mom. "I wanted to find something special," he said. "But I got scared, so I found some salt instead."
Mom hugged him again. "I'm glad you found something to remind you that I love you," she said.
