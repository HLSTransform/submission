Once upon a time there was a little girl called Penny. She wanted to find a friend to play with. So she moved around the garden, looking and searching. 
Suddenly, she saw a small, soft creature in the corner of the garden. It had big ears and whiskers. Penny wondered what it was. She moved closer and to her surprise, it was a little bunny.
The bunny hopped around, happy to see Penny. She was so excited to have a new friend. Penny reached out and gently touched its soft fur. She was delighted.
The two friends spent all afternoon playing together. They hopped and skipped and tickled each other. Penny couldnâ€™t believe her luck. She had found a soft, new friend to play with.
