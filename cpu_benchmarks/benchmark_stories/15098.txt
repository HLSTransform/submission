Once upon a time, there was a girl called Amy. She saw something curious one day. It was a little box, left open on the floor. She slowly touched it. Suddenly, a white smoke filled up the room. Amy was so surprised that she ran away.
When she came back, she saw her Dad. He was looking at the box. Amy said to him, “Daddy, did you touch the box?”
Her Dad smiled. “Yes honey, I did. I opened it to see what was inside but smoke came out. Do you know where it came from?” 
Amy shook her head. Then she asked, “Can I touch it now?”
Her Dad said, “No, let’s keep it open and see what happens. Maybe something funny will come out of it.” 
So Amy and her Dad watched the box to see what would happen.
