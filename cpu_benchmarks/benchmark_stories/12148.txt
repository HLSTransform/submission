John dreamed of travelling by plane. He would look up at the sky and watch the planes fly up high. He was gifted with an urge to explore, so his desire to fly grew stronger every day.
One day his mum noticed John watching the planes pass and said, "John, why don't we go on a plane?" 
John's eyes lit up and he said, "Really, mum? Can we go on a plane?"
Mum answered with a smile, "Yes, John, let's go on a plane!"
John was overjoyed. He raced around the house, excited for his first plane ride. Finally the day came and John and mum boarded the plane. John was all eyes as he looked out of the window, watching the clouds drift by. 
As the plane touched down, John felt the urge to explore and adventure turn into a reality. He was suddenly excited for all the new and exciting things that he could experience. 
Mum whispered in John's ear, "My gifted little explorer, our journey has only just begun."
