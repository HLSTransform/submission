Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her pink belt with sparkles on it. One day, she saw her brother wearing a heavy tool belt. 
"Wow, your belt is so heavy!" she said to him. 
"Yeah, I'm testing it out to see if it will hold all of my tools," he replied. 
Lily thought for a moment and then asked, "Can I help you test it?" 
"Sure, but be careful," her brother warned. 
Lily helped her brother test the belt and they found out that it was strong enough to hold all of his tools. She learned that sometimes it's important to test things before using them. The moral of the story is to always be safe and smart when trying new things.
