Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a big rock and a small glass. One day, he went to play with his friends in the park. Tim liked to rock the glass back and forth, making it go up and down. He thought it was fun.
While Tim was playing, a rude boy named Max came and took Tim's rock. Tim was sad and asked Max to give it back. Max laughed and said no. Tim's friends saw this and didn't like it. They wanted to help Tim.
Tim's friends came up with a plan. They found more rocks and gave them to Tim. Then, they all played rock and glass together. Max saw how much fun they were having and wanted to join. Tim said Max could play, but only if he said sorry and gave back the rock. Max said sorry, gave back the rock, and they all played together. From that day on, Max was not rude anymore.
