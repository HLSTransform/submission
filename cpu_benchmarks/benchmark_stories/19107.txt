Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to ride her bike with her friends, but one day she noticed her tire was flat. She tried to ride it anyway, but it was wobbly and hard to balance. 
Lily was sad because she couldn't ride her bike with her friends anymore. But one day, her dad came home with a new tire. It was available at the store and he bought it just for her. 
Lily was happy again and put the tire on her bike. She rode it all around the park with her friends. But then, she saw another little girl who didn't have a bike at all. Lily thought about how sad she was when she couldn't ride her bike and decided to share it with the other girl. 
The other girl was so happy to have a bike to ride and Lily felt good about helping someone else. She learned that sharing is important and it made her feel even more balanced and happy.
