Once upon a time there was a little girl. She was three years old and she loved helping her mom around the house. Every day, her mom would give her something to do like cleaning up her toys or making her bed. The little girl worked very hard. She was always busy!
One day, she was helping her mom when she saw something amazing. Her mom had made her a special surpriseâ€”a pink cupcake with sprinkles! She was so happy she gave her mom a big hug and thanked her for the treat.
The little girl never forgot that special day. Whenever she felt tired from doing her work, she thought back to that moment and it made her smile. She was very thankful for all the things her mom did for her.
The end.
