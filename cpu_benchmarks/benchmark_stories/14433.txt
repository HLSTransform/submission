Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play outside. One day, she saw a big bucket in her backyard. It was so big that she could fit inside it! She climbed inside and started to play.
Suddenly, her little brother Jack came outside and saw the bucket. "I want to play too!" he said. But Lily didn't want to share the bucket. "No, it's mine!" she said.
Jack started to cry and Lily felt bad. She knew she should share. "Okay, you can play too," she said. Jack was happy and they played together in the soft grass. They even pretended to bow to each other like they were in a royal kingdom. From that day on, they shared the bucket and played together every day.
