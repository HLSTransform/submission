Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to walk on the path in the park. One day, she wanted to go fast on her bike. So, she asked her mommy to help her. Her mommy said yes and they went to the park. 
Lily got on her bike and started to pedal really fast. She felt the wind in her hair and it was so much fun. Suddenly, she saw her friends arrive at the park. They were happy to see her and they all played together. 
After playing for a while, Lily and her friends went back on the path. They walked slowly and talked about their day. When it was time to go home, Lily said goodbye to her friends and promised to come back soon. She went home with a big smile on her face, happy to have had a fun day in the park.
