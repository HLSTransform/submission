Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. Tom was honest and he always tried his best to do the right thing. One day, Tom was walking past a gum store when he saw something special. He saw two separate pieces of wondrous gum!
Tom had never seen gum like this before. He knew he really wanted to try it. So he opened his pocket and pulled out all his money. He counted the coins and it was enough to buy the gum.
Tom took the gum and went home. He was so excited! But when Tom sat down on the couch, the gum slipped out of his hand and landed on the floor.
The pieces of gum had separated! Tom was sad. He didn't want the gum to be apart. Then, he remembered how honest he was. He had enough coins to buy the gum, so he ran back to the store and bought two more pieces.
When Tom came back, he put the pieces of gum together. He was so happy! The gum was back together, just like he wanted. From that day on, Tom was always honest and he never separated gum anymore.
