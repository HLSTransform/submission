Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy bear that she loved very much. One day, her friend Tommy came to visit her. Tommy wanted to play with the toy bear, but Lily didn't want to give it to him. 
Tommy urged Lily to share her toy, but she was too afraid that he would break it. They argued and Lily felt very sad. Suddenly, her mother came into the room and saw what was happening. 
She told Lily that it's important to share and be kind to friends. Lily realized that she was being selfish and decided to give Tommy the toy bear to play with. They played together and had a great time. Lily felt happy that she made her friend happy too. 
The moral of the story is that sharing is important and it can bring people closer together, even if they feel distant at first.
