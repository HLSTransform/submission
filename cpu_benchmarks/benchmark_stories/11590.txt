Once upon a time, there was a young girl. She had a box full of pastel crayons. The girl went outside one day to play. She wanted to leave her box of crayons and explore.
She went to the park and played in the sand. She made a beautiful sandcastle. After she finished, she decided to leave. Just as she was about to, she saw a young butterfly. She stopped and watched it flap its wings. She watched it fly away, leaving its colorful wings behind. 
The young girl was inspired. She grabbed her box of pastel crayons and drew a picture of the butterfly. She left the picture in the park. 
The girl ran back home and showed her family her drawing. They all smiled and applauded her work. 
The young girl was so proud of her picture. It was a reminder of her beautiful day at the park.
