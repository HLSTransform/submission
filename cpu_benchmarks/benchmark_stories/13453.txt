Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had to go to her class. She was very excited to go to school and learn new things. Her mom helped her pack her bag with her favorite books and pencils.
On the way to class, Lily met her friend Max. Max asked, "What's in your bag, Lily?" Lily replied, "My books and pencils. I packed them carefully so they don't break."
When they arrived at class, the teacher asked Lily to show everyone what she packed. Lily proudly showed her books and pencils to the class. The teacher said, "Lily, you packed your bag very carefully. Well done!"
Lily was happy that she did a good job packing her bag. She enjoyed her class and learned many new things that day.
