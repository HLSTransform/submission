Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to eat her breakfast on a big plate with colorful flowers on it. One morning, she peeked out the window and saw a little bird flying around. She wanted to share her mild cereal with the bird, so she went outside with her plate. The bird chirped happily and ate some of the cereal. Lily was so happy to share her breakfast with her new bird friend.
