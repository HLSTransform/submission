Louise was walking through the park with her mum. The sun was shining and the sky was blue. It was a beautiful day. Louise saw something amazing in the sky. It was a big, colourful rainbow! She pointed to it and said "Look mummy. What is that?" Her mum said "That, my darling, is a rainbow!"
Louise smiled, and laughed with delight. She wanted to get closer, so she ran to the end of the park. When she reached the edge, she spotted a regular old tree. Louise laughed again, but this time it was even louder!
Suddenly, it started to rain. Louise was still looking at the rainbow and smiling. She held out her hands and tried to catch the rain. Her mum said "Come on, it's time to go home now. We can still see the rainbow from our window."
Louise smiled and looked up at the sky one more time. She waved at the rainbow, then she followed her mum. She was sure she could still hear the rainbow laughing.
