One day, a fat bird named Billy was flying near the sea. He saw a big boat with a big anchor. The boat was colorful and pretty. Billy wanted to see it closer.
Billy flew down to the boat and saw a little girl. The girl saw Billy and said, "Hi bird, can you whistle a song for me?" Billy was happy to whistle a song. He whistled a happy song and the girl clapped her hands.
After whistling, Billy and the girl played near the anchor. They had lots of fun. When it was time to go, Billy flew back to his tree and the girl waved goodbye. They both had a great day.
