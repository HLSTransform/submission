Tom and Anna are friends. They like to play together in the park. One day, Tom has a gift for Anna. He gives her a big box with a bow.
"What is it?" Anna asks.
"Open it and see," Tom says.
Anna opens the box. Inside is a toy dinosaur. It is green and has sharp teeth. Anna thinks it is scary.
"Ah!" Anna screams. She drops the box and runs away.
Tom is sad. He likes the dinosaur. He thinks it is cool.
"Why are you scared?" Tom asks. "It is not real. It is just a toy."
Anna stops and looks at Tom. She sees that he is holding the dinosaur. He is not scared. He is smiling.
"Are you sure?" Anna asks.
"Yes, I am sure," Tom says. "Look, it can make noises. Roar!"
He presses a button on the dinosaur. It makes a loud roar. Anna jumps.
"Wow, that is loud," Anna says.
"But it is fun," Tom says. "Do you want to try?"
Anna is curious. She walks back to Tom. She takes the dinosaur from him. She presses the button. It roars again.
"Roar!" Anna says. She laughs.
Tom laughs too. He is happy. He admires Anna. She is brave.
"Thank you for the gift, Tom," Anna says. "It is scary, but it is also cool. I like it."
"You are welcome, Anna," Tom says. "You are my best friend."
They hug. They play with the dinosaur. They have fun.
