Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big flag on a pole. The flag is red and white and blue. It moves in the wind.
"Look, Mia, the flag is flexible!" Tom says. "It can bend and twist and wave."
"I want to touch the flag," Mia says. "It looks soft and pretty."
They run to the pole. But the pole is too high. They cannot reach the flag.
"Let's lie on the grass and look at the flag," Tom says. "Maybe we can see the shapes on it."
They lie on the grass and look up. They see stars and stripes on the flag.
"What are those shapes, Tom?" Mia asks.
"Those are stars and stripes," Tom says. "They are symbols of our country. My dad told me."
"What is a country?" Mia asks.
"A country is a big place where we live," Tom says. "There are many countries in the world. They have different flags and different names."
"Wow, that's interesting," Mia says. "I like our flag. It is flexible and beautiful."
They smile and watch the flag. They feel happy and proud. They are friends and they love their country.
