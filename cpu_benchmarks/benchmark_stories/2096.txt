Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the park with her friends. One day, Lily's mom gave her a new toy to play with. It was a shiny red ball that bounced really high.
Lily was so happy with her new toy that she wanted to show it to her friends. When she got to the park, she saw that her friends were sad because they couldn't find their treasure box. Lily wanted to help her friends, so she provided them with her new ball to play with.
Suddenly, one of Lily's friends noticed something shiny under a tree. It was the treasure box! They all ran over to see what was inside. They found a bunch of shiny coins and jewels. They were so happy and grateful to Lily for providing them with her new toy. From that day on, they all played together with Lily's shiny red ball and the treasure box. The end.
