Sara liked to play golf with her dad. He taught her how to hold the club and hit the ball. She had a pink club and a pink ball. She felt happy when she saw the ball fly in the air.
One day, they went to the golf course with her dad's friend, Ben. Ben was very good at golf. He hit the ball far and fast. He was graceful, like a bird. Sara wanted to be like him.
She tried to copy him, but she hit the ball too hard. The ball went out of the course and hit a window. She heard a loud crash and saw glass break. She was scared and sad. She thought her dad and Ben would be angry with her.
She ran to her dad and hugged him. She said, "I'm sorry, dad. I broke the window. I was bad. Please don't be mad at me."
Her dad smiled and kissed her. He said, "It's okay, Sara. You made a mistake, but you are not bad. I'm not mad at you. I forgive you. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. You just need to practice more and be careful."
He took her hand and walked to the window. He saw a man come out of the house. He said, "Hello, sir. I'm sorry about the window. My daughter was playing golf and she hit the ball by accident. We will pay for the damage."
The man looked at Sara and saw her sad face. He said, "Don't worry, little girl. I'm not mad at you either. I forgive you. You have a nice dad who loves you. Next time, just aim for the hole, not the window."
He laughed and shook hands with her dad and Ben. He said, "Enjoy your game, guys. And good luck, Sara. You have a lot of potential. You can be a graceful golfer one day."
