Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved the ocean and he loved to fish. One day, Timmy caught a big, colorful tuna. He was so happy that he ran home to show his mom. 
"Mommy, mommy! Look at the big fish I caught!" Timmy exclaimed.
His mom was amazed by the colorful tuna. "Wow, Timmy! That's a big one. What are you going to do with it?" she asked.
"I'm going to sell it to the fish market and make lots of money!" Timmy replied.
So, Timmy and his mom went to the fish market to sell the tuna. The fisherman was so impressed by the big, colorful tuna that he paid Timmy a lot of money for it. Timmy was so happy that he could buy lots of toys with the money. From that day on, Timmy loved fishing even more and dreamed of catching more colorful tunas to sell.
