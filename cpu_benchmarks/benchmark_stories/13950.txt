Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside, especially when it rained. One day, Lily saw a big puddle in the middle of the street. She wanted to jump in it, but her mom said it was too deep and she might get hurt. 
Lily's friend, Timmy, dared her to jump in the puddle anyway. Lily was unsure because she always tried to be honest and follow her mom's rules. But Timmy kept daring her and saying she was too scared to jump. The conflict inside Lily's head grew bigger and bigger. 
Suddenly, a car drove by and splashed water all over the puddle. Lily was so surprised that she fell into the puddle! She was wet and dirty, but she wasn't hurt. Timmy was laughing and saying how brave she was for jumping in. Lily realized that sometimes it's okay to take a small risk and have fun, as long as she's safe and honest about it.
