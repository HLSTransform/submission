Once upon a time, there lived two friends: Ben and Sam. They loved playing together and having lots of fun. One day, Ben found an incredible diamond in the park and was very excited! He wanted to share it with Sam, so he ran back to show him.
When Ben found Sam, he said, "Look! I found a diamond!" But when Sam saw the diamond, he said, "It's broken. It's no good." Ben didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, Ben had an idea! He said, "Let's try to repair it. We'll make it as good as new!" Sam was excited.
They spent the afternoon trying to repair the diamond, and after a lot of hard work, they succeeded! The diamond was as good as new.
Ben and Sam were so proud of their work. They smiled and hugged each other, happy that their incredible diamond was back and ready for them to share.
