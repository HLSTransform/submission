Once upon a time, there was a panda. He was very organized. Every day, he went out looking for something to settle in. 
He came across a big tree and he thought it was perfect. He decided to settle in the tree. 
He set up a home with lots of bamboo to eat. He felt safe in his new home and was very happy. 
He settled into a nice routine and took care of himself. He found friends who also lived nearby and they often played together. 
The panda was so organized that everyone in the forest admired him. He lived there for many years and was very content. 
The end.
