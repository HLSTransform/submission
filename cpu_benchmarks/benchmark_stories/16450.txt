Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play together. But sometimes they fought over their toys and games. Lily was bossy and wanted to decide everything. Tom was tired of listening to her.
Yesterday, they had a big fight over the puzzle. Lily said it was hers and she knew how to do it. Tom said he wanted to help and he had a good idea. Lily shouted at him and pushed him away. Tom got angry and threw a piece of the puzzle at her. Lily cried and ran to their mom.
Mom was not happy. She said they had to share and be nice to each other. She said they had to go to their room and relax. She said they could not come out until they said sorry and hugged.
Tom and Lily went to their room. They did not talk to each other. They sat on their beds and looked at the wall. They felt sad and bored. They missed playing together.
After a while, Tom said, "Lily, I'm sorry I threw the puzzle at you. That was not nice." Lily said, "Tom, I'm sorry I shouted at you and pushed you. That was not nice either." They got up and hugged. They said they loved each other.
They decided to play with the puzzle again. They took turns and listened to each other. They had fun and finished the puzzle. They were happy and proud.
Mom came to their room and saw them smiling and holding hands. She said, "Well done, Tom and Lily. You learned how to relax and get along. I'm proud of you." She gave them a big hug and a kiss. She said they could go and play outside. Tom and Lily ran to the garden and played with their ball. They were good twins.
