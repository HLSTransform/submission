Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the big, wide world. One day, she found a shiny rock on the ground. It was smooth and cool to the touch. 
Lily wanted to show her mom the rock, but when she got home, she found her mom speaking a language she didn't understand. She tried to ask her mom about the rock, but her mom seemed to not understand her. 
Lily felt frustrated and refused to give up. She went to her room and started drawing pictures of the rock. She drew it with all its rough edges and sparkly parts. 
The next day, she showed her mom the picture and her mom finally understood what she wanted to show her. Lily felt happy that she was able to communicate with her mom, even though they spoke different languages. From then on, she knew that even if things seemed hard, she could always find a way to make herself understood.
