Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they find a creek near their house. The creek has water and rocks and fish.
"Look, Anna, a fish!" Ben says. He points to a shiny fish in the water.
"I see it, Ben. It is pretty," Anna says. She wants to touch the fish.
"Can we catch the fish?" Ben asks. He looks for a stick or a net.
"I don't know, Ben. Maybe we can try," Anna says. She sees a big rock in the creek. She thinks it can be a bridge.
"Come on, Ben. Let's go to the rock. Maybe we can get closer to the fish," Anna says. She walks to the edge of the creek.
"OK, Anna. But be careful. The water is cold and deep," Ben says. He follows Anna.
Anna steps on the rock. It is wet and slippery. She almost falls.
"Whoa, Anna. Hold on. I will help you," Ben says. He reaches for Anna's hand.
"Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend," Anna says. She grabs Ben's hand. He helps her to the other side of the rock.
They see the fish again. It is swimming near them.
"Wow, Anna. We are lucky. The fish is still here," Ben says. He smiles.
"Yes, Ben. We are lucky. Maybe we can say hello to the fish," Anna says. She waves to the fish.
The fish sees them. It wiggles its tail. It looks like it is saying hello back.
"Hello, fish. We are Anna and Ben. We are friends. You are pretty," Anna says.
"Hello, fish. We are Ben and Anna. We are friends. You are shiny," Ben says.
The fish swims closer to them. It looks happy.
Anna and Ben are happy too. They have a new friend in the creek. They encourage each other to be kind and brave. They have fun playing with the fish. They are lucky.
