Once upon a time, there was a white cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to work at the store. Every day, Fluffy would help put things on the shelves.
One day, a little boy came into the store. He saw Fluffy and said, "Hi, Fluffy! Can you help me find a toy?" Fluffy nodded and led the boy to the toy shelf. The boy picked a red ball and said, "Thank you, Fluffy!"
Later, Fluffy saw a girl crying. Fluffy asked, "Why are you sad?" The girl said, "I lost my mom." Fluffy held her hand and helped her find her mom. The girl hugged Fluffy and smiled.
The people in the store loved Fluffy because he was always kind and helpful. The moral of the story is to always be kind and help others, just like Fluffy the white cat.
