Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was very happy and filled with glee.
She loved going out to pick oranges from the trees.
One day, when she was picking oranges, she heard a strange noise. It sounded like a cheering crowd saying the word, "Welcome!"
The little girl was so excited that she quickly ran towards the sound. When she arrived, she saw a big, orange tree with lots of sour oranges.
The little girl was so happy that she welcomed the orange tree with a big smile. She thanked it for the delicious oranges and quickly picked many of them.
The little girl then went home with her bag full of sour oranges. She shared the oranges with her family and everyone was so happy.
The little girl will forever remember to welcome the orange tree whenever she visited it.
