Once upon a time there was a small girl who was out playing in the park. She was having a great time when she fell and started to cry.
Just then, a big monster came out of nowhere. He was so scary that she screamed and ran away.
The monster chased after her, but before it could get too close, a brave hero swooped in and rescued her.
The hero asked the monster, "Why are you chasing this small girl?"
The monster said in a deep voice, "I am scared of the word peaceful. I want to hide in the park so nobody sees me."
The hero said, "There is no need to be scared. Being peaceful is a good thing! I will help you."
The hero stayed with the small girl and the monster until they were all safe. Then, the hero gave the monster a hug and said goodbye.
The small girl thought the hero was very brave and kind. She was so happy and thankful that he had come to her rescue.
