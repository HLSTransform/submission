Once there was a grumpy old man. He was always walking around and scowling at everyone. He had an old gun that he kept with him all the time. One day, he was walking down the road with the gun when he saw a curious little boy.
The man stopped and asked the little boy what he was doing. The little boy said he was just playing and having fun. The man was grumpy and said, "No, this is dangerous. You must not do this!" 
The little boy was scared and ran away. The man watched him go and shook his head. He hated to see little kids playing with dangerous things. He knew that guns were not toys and he was determined to do something to make sure that no one else got hurt.
