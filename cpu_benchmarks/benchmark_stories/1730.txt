Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and sing songs. One day, she was playing with her dolls when she heard a fierce noise outside. She went to the window and saw a big truck driving by.
Lily asked her mommy, "What is that noise?" Her mommy said, "That's a truck, Lily. It's carrying things from one place to another." Lily listened and heard the sound of the truck getting quieter as it drove away.
Later that day, Lily was playing with her mommy's nail polish. She accidentally spilled it on the carpet. Her mommy said, "Oh no, Lily! You spilled the nail polish. We need to clean it up." Lily helped her mommy clean the nail polish off the carpet.
As they were cleaning, Lily asked her mommy, "What does fierce mean?" Her mommy said, "Fierce means something that is very strong and powerful. Like a lion is fierce." Lily listened and learned a new word.
