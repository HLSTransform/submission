Once upon a time, in a big green field, there was a bush. The bush had many yummy berries. The berries were red, blue, and purple. Animals loved to eat the berries. The bush was the best place to find the yummiest berries available.
One sunny day, a rabbit, a squirrel, and a bird decided to gather berries from the bush. They wanted to have a big berry party. The rabbit hopped, the squirrel ran, and the bird flew to the bush. They all picked the berries they liked best.
After they gathered all the berries they could, they had a big party. They shared the berries with each other and had lots of fun. They laughed, played, and ate until they were full. The bush was happy to see the animals enjoy its yummy berries.
