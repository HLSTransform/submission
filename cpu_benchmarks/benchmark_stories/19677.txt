One day there was a regular tank. It was filled with water and it had a lid. The tank was very heavy and one day it dropped. The lid fell off and out came a stream of water. 
The water spilled out onto the ground and made a big puddle. All the water in the tank dropped onto the ground, so quickly that nobody saw it happen. 
Tiny fish were living in the tank. The fish were all so scared of the loud noise and the spilling of the water. 
But the fish were all ok. They found a big puddle and just stayed there. 
They were happy because the water in the puddle was just like the water in the tank and they could swim around. Even if the dropped tank was regular, it made a new home for the little fish.
