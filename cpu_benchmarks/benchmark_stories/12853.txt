Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Alice. She was three years old and loved to play outside. One day, Alice was in her backyard when she heard a noise.
Alice looked around, but she couldn't see where the noise was coming from. She asked her neighbor, "Where is the noise coming from?"
The neighbor smiled and said, "There's a puppy standing over there, near the tree. He looks safe."
Alice was so excited! Her eyes grew wide and she said, "Let's go say hello to him!"
Alice and her neighbor walked over to the puppy. He was standing very still, but when Alice said hello, he wagged his tail and licked her face!
Alice was so happy she had a new neighbor. She gave him lots of pets and then said goodbye. As she walked away, she looked back one more time, content that her new neighbor felt safe in his new home.
