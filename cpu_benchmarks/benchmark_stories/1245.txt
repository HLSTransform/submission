Terry was a tall boy. He had a special jacket. It was made for stretching. Every morning, Terry put on his special jacket and started stretching. He would stretch his arms above his head, reach down to his toes, and twist from side to side. He loved stretching in his favorite jacket.
One day, Terry saw his friend Jack stretching too. He asked Jack, "Why are you stretching?" Jack said, "I'm stretching because it keeps me healthy!" Terry thought that was a great idea and decided to stretch more with his special jacket.
As Terry stretched, he felt his body getting stronger and taller. He kept stretching each morning and saw that he was growing taller and taller each day. He even convinced his friends to join him and stretch together.
Terry became very good at stretching and was proud of his special jacket. He kept stretching his arms, reaching his toes, and twisting from side to side. Terry always remembered one thing: stretching in his special jacket made him feel strong, healthy, and most of all, tall!
