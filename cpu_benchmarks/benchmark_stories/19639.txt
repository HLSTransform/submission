Once there was a sailor who was always so tight. He never smiled and he looked very sad. Everywhere he went, he carried a large bag full of treasures he had found in his sailing trips. 
One day, the sailor was walking down the beach when he heard someone calling his name. He looked and spotted a small child. The child ran towards the sailor and hugged him very tight. 
The sailor was so surprised! He opened his bag and took out a beautiful present. He gave it to the little child and smiled. 
The child was so happy! He took the present and shook it loudly. It was full of surprises! 
The boy thanked the sailor and hugged him tightly. From then on, wherever the sailor went, the child followed him and always brought him a lot of joy.
