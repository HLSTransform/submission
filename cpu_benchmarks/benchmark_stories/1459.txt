Once upon a time, a little girl named Sarah wanted to visit her grandpa. She asked her mom if they could go on an adventure, and her mom said yes.
They got in the car and drove for a long time. As they drove, Sarah noticed the ground shaking. She asked her mom what it was, and her mom told her that it was an earthquake.
The car stopped in front of a big house. Sarah was so excited to see her grandpa. She knocked on the door and Grandpa opened it. His voice was soft and kind. He welcomed Sarah with a big hug.
They went inside, and Sarah couldn't believe how cozy it was. She saw a big kitchen and a soft bed. She played there with her grandpa all day, until it was time to go home. 
Before they left, Sarah gave her grandpa a big hug. It was the best visit ever!
