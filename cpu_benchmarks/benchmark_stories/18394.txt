Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Hop. Hop loved to jump and play all day long. One day, Hop found an unusual journal in the forest. It was filled with pictures and stories of other animals. Hop was so excited to have found such a special book! 
Hop decided to show the journal to all of his friends. They were all amazed by the unusual pictures and stories inside. They asked Hop where he found it, but Hop could not remember. 
From that day on, Hop loved to read the journal and share the stories with his friends. It was a special treasure that he would always keep close to his heart.
