Lily likes to listen to stories. She likes stories about animals, princesses, and pirates. Every night, her dad tells her a story before she goes to sleep.
One night, her dad tells her a story about a man who travels to many places. The man sees mountains, oceans, and deserts. He meets different people and learns new things. He has a big backpack with a map, a camera, and a hat.
Lily thinks the man is very interesting. She asks her dad many questions about the man and his adventures. She wants to know what he eats, what he wears, and what he does. She imagines that she is the man and travels with him.
Her dad smiles and answers her questions. He tells her that the man loves to explore and discover new things. He tells her that the man is curious, brave, and kind. He tells her that the man is his friend and that he met him when he was young.
Lily feels happy and excited. She tells her dad that she wants to be like the man when she grows up. She wants to see the world and make new friends. She hugs her dad and thanks him for the story. She closes her eyes and dreams of the man and his backpack.
