Anna was a shy little girl. She had a red cart, and she pushed it around the park. She noticed a stranger talking to someone. She was curious, so she slowly walked towards them. 
The stranger noticed her and said "Hello there. What's your name?".
Anna was shy, so she whispered "My name is Anna." 
The stranger smiled and said "I'm Bob. It's nice to meet you Anna. Do you want to talk with me?". 
Anna nodded her head. She liked to talk.
Bob and Anna talked for a while. She told him about her red cart, and he told her about his adventures. Soon, it was time for Anna to go home.
Anna smiled and said goodbye to Bob. She pushed her red cart around the park one more time, feeling excited about meeting someone new.
