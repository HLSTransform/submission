Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She was three years old and she had red bouncy curls. Lucy loved playing in the garden and exploring new things with her mommy.
One sunny day, Lucy was really excited because her mom had a surprise for her. She opened the box and she saw a pair of cool sunglasses! She jumped up and down and said, "Mommy, I love them!"
Her mommy looked at her with a smile and said, "I'm so happy you like them, Lucy. Now put them on carefully." Lucy put the sunglasses on and the bright sunshine dazzled her eyes.
Suddenly, a disgusting smell filled the air. Lucy began to cough and her mommy said, "Ah, that's too bad! What is that disgusting smell?"
Lucy looked around and then she noticed a pile of smelly rubbish on the ground. She said, "Mommy, I love you but I don't like this. Let's go somewhere else and play."
Her mommy scooped her up and said, "Lucy, you have such a kind, loving heart! Let's go somewhere far away from the stinky rubbish."
And so Lucy and her mommy went away, far away from the nasty, disgusting smell. They forgot all about it and had lots of fun with Lucy's new sunglasses, playing in the park and building sandcastles by
