Once upon a time, a little animal was walking in the forest. Suddenly, it started to panic because it could not find its mommy. It looked everywhere, but it was not available. It felt so scared and lonely. 
The animal kept walking until it heard a familiar noise. It was its mommyâ€™s voice! The animal ran as fast as it could towards the sound. When it got close enough, it realized that its mommy had been searching for it too. 
As soon as the animal saw its mommy, it felt much better. It smiled and hugged her tightly. From that day, the animal made sure not to wander off too far; it drew a line on the ground, so it would always be available when mommy was looking for it!
