Once upon a time there was a very lucky lady named Helena. Helena went for a walk one day, but realised she'd forgotten to attach her keys to her keyring. Oh no! Without her keys, she was locked out of her house!
Helena felt so helpless, until she saw a friendly looking little girl called Kayla. 'Hi Kayla,' Helena said, 'Do you think you could help me? I've lost my keys and can't get into my house!'
Kayla smiled and thought for a moment. 'I can help!' she said happily. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a bright red key. 'I found this key in the garden this morning. Maybe you can use it to get in!' 
Helena was so relieved, she thanked Kayla and tried the key. It worked! She was back in her house. Helena was so lucky - she would never have been able to get back in without Kayla's help!
