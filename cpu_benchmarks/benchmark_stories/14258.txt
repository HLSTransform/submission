Once there was a brave little girl. She lived in a house with her family. One day, her sisters wanted to have some fun so they decided to tease her. They started to tease her about the stove. But the brave little girl wouldn't let them get away with it. She stood up to them and said she wasn't scared of the stove! 
But they didn't want to listen. They kept on teasing her, telling her to go over to the stove. So the brave little girl decided to go over and show them that she wasn't scared. But the stove was very hot and she got burned. She was so scared and sad. 
The brave little girl was very brave but the teasing didn't have a good ending. She learned her lesson and never let her sisters tease her again.
