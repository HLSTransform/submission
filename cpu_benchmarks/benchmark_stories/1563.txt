Once upon a time, there was a young bird. It had just hatched from its egg and was very delicate. Its mommy bird took care of it and taught it how to fly. The young bird felt very happy when it finally learned how to fly.
One day, the young bird saw a big and juicy worm on the ground. It felt very hungry and wanted to eat the worm. But the mommy bird warned it that the worm might be dangerous. The young bird didn't listen and ate the worm anyway.
After a while, the young bird started to feel sick. It regretted not listening to its mommy bird. It realized that it should have been more careful and not eaten something that looked suspicious. From then on, the young bird promised to always listen to its mommy bird and be more careful in the future.
