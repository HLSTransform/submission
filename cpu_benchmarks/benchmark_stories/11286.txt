Once upon a time there was a mom and a dad that loved each other very much. One day, mommy said to daddy, "I think its time for us to trust our little girl and give her some sauce!" Daddy didn't think this was a good idea because he thought their little girl was too silly. Mommy said, "We can do it. I know our daughter can handle it."
So mommy and daddy decided to let their daughter try some sauce. She was very excited and smiled really big. She scooped some sauce on her spoon and tasted it. She smiled again even bigger after she tasted it and said, "I love it mommy and daddy! Thank you for trusting me!" Mommy and daddy were so happy that their daughter loved the sauce and that they showed her that they trusted her enough to try it.
