Once upon a time, there was a girl named Ella. She was three years old and loved to play. One day, Ella decided to go swinging. She carefully climbed onto the swing and grabbed the belt. She slowly pushed off the ground and began to swing. 
Ella started off slow, but she soon wanted to go faster. She pumped her legs as hard as she could and flew back and forth. The wind blew in her face and she could feel the sun on her skin. She was so happy to be swinging. 
After a while, Ella got tired and started to swing slower. She smiled as she looked out and saw a beautiful butterfly nearby. She enjoyed just sitting and swinging back and forth. 
Ella decided she was done with swinging and slowly stepped off the swing. She grabbed the belt and made her way back home. She had a wonderful time and smiled to herself, planning her next adventure.
