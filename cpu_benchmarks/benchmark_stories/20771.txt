Sam was playing in the garden one day when he saw something strange. He saw a small furry animal that had never been there before. Its eyes were wide and it looked very upset. Sam wanted to help the animal and he urged it to come closer to him. With careful steps, the animal eventually reached Sam. He stroked its small head and cupped its face in his hands. The animal's mouth opened and it made a funny sound. Sam soon realized that the animal was asking for food. So he took it inside to his mum and asked her to feed it. His mum was a bit surprised at first, but she eventually agreed and gave the animal a small bowl of food. The animal was happy and it jumped around with joy. Its upset had been replaced with a deep contentment. Sam was glad he had managed to help the animal. It was the happiest moment of his day.
