One day, a little boy named Tim found a letter on the floor. He picked it up and looked at it. He could not read, so he asked his intelligent big sister, Jane, to help him.
Jane read the letter out loud. "Dear Tim, I am your friend, Mr. Cat. I lost my toy. Can you find it? Love, Mr. Cat." Tim wanted to help his friend, so he and Jane looked everywhere for the toy.
They looked under the bed, behind the door, and even in the garden. Finally, they found the toy in a tree. Tim was so happy, he screamed, "We found it, Jane!" They gave the toy back to Mr. Cat, and he was very thankful.
