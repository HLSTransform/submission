Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside with her yellow ball. One day, she went to the store with her mommy. Her mommy told her to pick out a toy, but Lily saw a big bag of apples. She asked her mommy, "Can I get apples instead?" Her mommy said, "Sure, but let's check the price first." 
Lily looked at the price and said, "It's too much!" Her mommy said, "We can still get some, just not the whole bag." As they were walking home, Lily took a bite out of an apple. She said, "Mmm, it's yummy!" 
When they got home, Lily shared her apple with her little brother. He took a bite too and said, "It's sour!" Lily laughed and said, "That's okay, I still love it."
