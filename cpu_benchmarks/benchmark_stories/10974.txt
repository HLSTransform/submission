Once upon a time, in a distant land, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim had a special spoon that he loved very much. He took it everywhere he went. One day, he lost his spoon and became very sad.
Tim asked his mom, "Mom, where is my spoon?" His mom did not know, so she replied, "I don't know, Tim. Let's look for it together." They looked all around the house, but they could not find the spoon.
Finally, they looked outside in the yard. There, under a big tree, Tim found his spoon! He was so happy. He picked it up and said, "I found you!" Tim and his mom went back inside, and Tim ate his dinner with his special spoon. And they all lived happily ever after.
