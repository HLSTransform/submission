One day, Mommy and Johnny were sitting on the sofa. Mommy was reading a newspaper and Johnny was playing with his toys. Suddenly, Johnny looked up and said, "Mommy, why are you reading a newspaper?" 
Mommy smiled and said, "I'm reading a newspaper to get some news about the world." 
Johnny asked, "What's news?"
Mommy replied, "News is like stories about things happening in the world. It's like reading a storybook but about real life!"
Johnny nodded thoughtfully. He looked around the room and noticed some of the toys were very messy. He said, "Mommy, can I read a newspaper too?" 
Mommy smiled. She said, "Oh sweetheart, newspapers are for grown-ups. Maybe one day when you get older, you can read the newspaper too."
Johnny thought about it for a moment and then ran off to play with his toys. But he kept thinking about the newspaper, and what it said.
