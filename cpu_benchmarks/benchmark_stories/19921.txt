Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park with her friends. One day, Lily's uncle came to visit her. He was a tall man with a big smile. Lily was happy to see him.
Uncle Jack asked Lily if she wanted to play a game. He said, "Let's count the number of birds we see in the park." Lily loved this idea and they started to count. They saw one bird, two birds, three birds and so on.
After a while, Lily started to feel cold. She told her uncle that she wanted to go home. Uncle Jack picked her up and carried her home. Lily felt warm and cozy in her uncle's arms. She was happy to have him as her uncle.
