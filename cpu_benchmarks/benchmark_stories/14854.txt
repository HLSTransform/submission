Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved going to the beach with his family. One day, while Timmy was playing in the sand, he saw a man waving at him. Timmy waved back and smiled.
Suddenly, Timmy's dad came over with a strip of sour candy. Timmy loved sour candy, so he happily took a piece and ate it. It made his face scrunch up and he made a funny noise.
After finishing his candy, Timmy went back to playing in the sand. He built a big castle and waved to his family to come see it. They all came over and were amazed by Timmy's castle. They all sat down and enjoyed some more sour candy together. The end.
