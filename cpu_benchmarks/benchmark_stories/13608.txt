Ben and Lily were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make yummy food. They used pots and pans, spoons and forks, and anything they could find.
"Look, Lily, I have a teaspoon!" Ben said, holding a small metal spoon. "I can use it to stir the soup."
"That's not a teaspoon, silly!" Lily said, holding a bigger spoon. "This is a teaspoon. Yours is too small. It's a baby spoon."
"No, it's not!" Ben said, feeling angry. "It's a teaspoon, and it's mine. Give me yours!"
Ben tried to grab Lily's spoon, but she pulled it away. They started to tug and pull, making a lot of noise.
"Stop it, you two!" Mom said, coming into the kitchen. She saw the mess they had made and the spoons they were fighting over. "What are you doing?"
"We're playing chefs, Mom," Lily said. "But Ben wants my teaspoon. He says his is a teaspoon, but it's not. It's a baby spoon."
Mom looked at the spoons and smiled. She had an idea. She took both spoons and put them on the table. Then she took a large wooden spoon from a drawer and gave it to Ben.
"Here, Ben, this is a teaspoon," she said. "A very large teaspoon. You can use it to stir the soup. And Lily, you can have this one. It's a tablespoon. A very small tablespoon. You can use it to taste the soup."
Ben and Lily looked at the spoons and their eyes widened. They had never seen such big and small spoons before. They felt happy and curious.
"Wow, thank you, Mom!" Ben said, taking the large spoon. "This is a great teaspoon. It can stir a lot of soup."
"Thank you, Mom!" Lily said, taking the small spoon. "This is a cute tablespoon. It can fit in my mouth."
They hugged Mom and went back to playing. They used their new spoons to make delicious soup. They learned that spoons can be different sizes and shapes, and that they can all be fun. They also learned to share and not fight. They had a good time in the kitchen.
