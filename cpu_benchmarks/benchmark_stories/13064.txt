Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lisa. She loved to dance and twirl around her house. One day, she asked her mom for a special belt she saw in the store. Her mom said to be patient and that it would be a surprise for her birthday. 
A few days later, on her birthday, Lisa was so excited when she saw her mom had gotten her the belt. She quickly put it on and went to her room to show her doll. 
When Lisa's mom came into the room, she saw Lisa had put the belt on the wrong way and she quickly pointed out the mistake. Lisa felt guilty and asked her mom if she was angry. 
Her mom told her it was okay and gave her a big hug. Lisa knew her mom still loved her, even if she made mistakes. She was so happy and thanked her mom for the special belt.
