Once upon a time there was a rabbit called Bob. Bob was a modest rabbit. His biggest dream was to go to the university. 
One day, Bob was hopping along in the forest. Suddenly, he came across an old building. It looked like the university! Bob hopped closer to have a better look.
Then, he saw a group of rabbits in gowns. They were wearing hats on their heads and were carrying books in their paws. Bob realised that this must be the university. He was so excited.
Bob hopped up to the group of rabbits and asked "Do you go to university?" 
One of the rabbits smiled. "Yes, we all go to university" he said. 
Bob was so happy, he wanted to join them. The rabbits said that he had to pass an eating test first. As the test went on, Bob ate and ate until he passed.
At the end of the test, they all cheered. And Bob was accepted into the university. He was so happy and so proud.
Bob couldn't wait to start learning at the university. And he lived happily ever after.
