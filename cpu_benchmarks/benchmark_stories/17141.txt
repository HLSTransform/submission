Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the garden. One day, Timmy's mommy gave him a rake to help clean up the leaves.
Timmy was very excited to use the rake. He started to rake the leaves into a big pile. Suddenly, he saw a little worm in the pile of leaves. Timmy picked up the worm and put it on a leaf.
"Are you okay, little worm?" Timmy asked.
"Yes, thank you," the worm replied.
Timmy was happy to help the little worm. He continued to rake the leaves into a big pile. When he was finished, he jumped into the pile of leaves and laughed.
Timmy's mommy came outside and saw the big pile of leaves. "Wow, Timmy, you did a great job! You are so strong," she said.
Timmy smiled and felt proud of himself. He knew that he had done a good job.
