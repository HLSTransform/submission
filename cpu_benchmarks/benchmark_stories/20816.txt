Once there was a fish who loved to listen. He swam around the ocean for hours without stopping to take a break. He loved listening to the sounds of the sea.
One day, a big net appeared in the water. The fish was very scared and he tried to escape. Unfortunately, he was too slow and he was caught in the net.
The fish was brought to a boat and put into a bucket. He was so sad and scared. He kept asking the owners of the boat to let him go, but they were not kind. They just laughed at him and kept him in the bucket.
The fish tried to escape many times, but he could not. All his efforts were in vain. In the end, he had no choice but to stay in the bucket forever. That was the bad ending for the fish who loved to listen.
