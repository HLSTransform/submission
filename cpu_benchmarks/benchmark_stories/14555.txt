One day a little girl was playing in the garden when it was time for the sunset. She grabbed her blanket and settled down in the grass to watch. The sky was a beautiful mix of oranges and pinks. The sunset was so pretty and the air was mild. 
Suddenly, a furry creature arrived in the garden. It was a big, big bunny! The little girl was very excited and followed the bunny as it hopped around. She laughed and laughed as the bunny hopped away. 
The bunny led her to a big hill in the garden. End of the hill was a big surprise. A huge rainbow had appeared in the sky! The little girl was amazed and enjoyed watching the rainbow until it disappeared as the sunset. 
The bunny and the little girl waved the sunset goodbye and then it was time for the little girl to go to bed. She said goodbye to the bunny feeling happy and content. She had seen a beautiful sunset and an even more beautiful rainbow!
