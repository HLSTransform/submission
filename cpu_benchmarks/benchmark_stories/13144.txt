Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Pat. She had a favorite toyâ€”a tiny pony. Every day, she loved to squeeze and hug it.
One day, Pat was playing in the garden when the toy pony flipped and landed away from her. Pat was scared at first, but then she became very persistent and kept looking for it. She searched everywhere and finally spotted the toy under a huge bush.
Pat was so happy that she quickly ran to the pony and gave it a big squeeze. She hugged it tightly and never wanted to let it go.
From then on, Pat never forgot to be careful with her beloved toy pony and they became best friends forever.
