Once upon a time, there was a prince and he was very brave. He liked to rescue things. One day, he got a call for help. Someone needed rescuing! So the prince put on his special clothes and he raced to help.
When he arrived, he saw a big dessert stuck in an even bigger tree. It was squeezed so tight, the prince couldn't get it out. The prince was determined to rescue the dessert so he got out his long ladder and climbed up the tree.
The prince worked hard and finally, he freed the dessert! He climbed down the ladder with the dessert in his arms and thanked the tree. Then he ran all the way home to his family, so they could eat the rescued dessert. Everybody was very happy and they enjoyed the sweet treat!
