Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, something special happened. She found a shiny penny on the ground! It was so pretty and made her very happy. 
Lily decided to show her mommy the penny. She ran to her mommy and said, "Look mommy! I found a penny!" Her mommy smiled and said, "That's great, Lily! It's so shiny and orange." 
Lily was so proud of her special penny. She kept it in her pocket all day and showed it to all of her friends. They all thought it was very cool. From that day on, Lily loved looking for pennies and finding special things that happen in her day.
