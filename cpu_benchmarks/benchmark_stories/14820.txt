Sara and Ben love to play outside in the sunshine. They run and jump and laugh and have fun. Sometimes they spin around and around until they feel dizzy. Then they fall down on the grass and look at the sky.
One day, Sara and Ben see a big cloud in the sky. It is gray and dark and scary. It covers the sunshine and makes everything cold and sad. Sara and Ben do not like the cloud. They want the sunshine back.
They have an idea. They decide to send a letter to the sunshine. They find some paper and crayons and write: "Dear sunshine, we miss you. Please come back soon. Love, Sara and Ben." They draw a picture of themselves smiling and holding hands. They fold the paper and put it in an envelope.
They look for a way to send the letter. They see a bird on a tree. They ask the bird: "Can you please take this letter to the sunshine?" The bird nods and takes the envelope in its beak. It flies away, high and fast.
Sara and Ben watch the bird until it disappears in the sky. They hope the sunshine will get their letter and come back. They wait and wait and wait. Then, they see something. The cloud starts to move. A bright ray of sunshine peeks through. Sara and Ben smile and clap. The sunshine got their letter! It came back to play with them. They run and jump and laugh and have fun again. They are happy.
