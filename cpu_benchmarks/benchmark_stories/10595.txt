Once upon a time, there was a lively little bunny who lived in the forest. 
One day, the bunny noticed a battery lying beside a tree. He asked his forest friends, "What is this?"
One of them said, "That's a battery! It can store energy."
The bunny was so excited and wanted to keep the battery. He said, "Great! I will store it in my home."
So the bunny took the battery back to his home and kept it safe. Every time he looked at it, he smiled and felt very happy. 
The end.
