Once there was a lonely marble resting at the top of a hill. It watched the day pass and all the other marbles rolling around together having fun. The lonely marble wished it had someone to play with too. 
Until one day, a person came and poured a bucket full of marbles right next to the lonely marble. Now the lonely marble was no longer alone. 
The two marbles rolled around together and enjoyed the sunny day. They chatted about the things they had seen in the world around them and made lots of good memories. 
The marbles stayed friends for a long time and every day, more and more marbles from the bucket joined them in playing. They were so happy to be together. 
The lonely marble was no longer lonely and no two marbles were ever happier!
