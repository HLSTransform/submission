One day, two little girls were at the park. They were both very excited to see the swans swimming in the icy water. They were both full of energy and wanted to go near the swans but their mum warned them to stay back.
The two girls slowly stepped closer and closer to the edge of the pond. Then they saw a little baby swan all alone. Its mommy and daddy had gone away and it looked so sad.
The two girls wanted to help the little baby swan. So they used the bread from the picnic basket to support him. They carefully threw the pieces towards the icy water, and the little swan was so excited.
The two girls smiled and felt proud that they had been able to support their little baby swan. They waved goodbye as the little swan happily found his family.
