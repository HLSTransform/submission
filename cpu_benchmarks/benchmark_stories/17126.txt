Once upon a time, there was a big elephant called Ellie. Ellie was very heavy because she ate a lot of food. One day, Ellie went to her friend's house to play. 
Ellie's friend was a little mouse called Mickey. Mickey was surprised to see Ellie because she was enormous! "Wow, Ellie! You're so big!" said Mickey. "Yes, I know. I'm very heavy too," replied Ellie. 
Mickey wanted to play dress up with Ellie. "Let's dress up, Ellie! I have a pretty dress for you," said Mickey. Ellie was excited to try on the dress. "This is a lovely dress, Mickey. Thank you!" said Ellie. 
Ellie and Mickey had a great time playing together. They ran around and had fun. Even though Ellie was enormous and heavy, she was still a great friend to little Mickey.
