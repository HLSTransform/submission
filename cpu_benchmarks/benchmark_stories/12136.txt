Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to explore his backyard at night with his flashlight. One night, he found a mysterious box buried in the ground. 
Excitedly, Timmy ran inside to show his mom. "Mommy, look what I found!" he exclaimed, holding up the box. 
His mom smiled and said, "Let's see what's inside." Together, they opened the box to reveal a humble treasure - a shiny rock. 
Timmy was disappointed at first, but his mom explained that sometimes the most precious things are simple and humble. Timmy agreed and added the rock to his collection, feeling proud of his discovery.
