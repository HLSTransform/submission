Tom and Lily were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big dog. The dog was wild. It had no collar and no leash. It barked and ran around.
"Let's go see the dog!" Tom said. He was brave and curious.
"No, Tom, it's too wild. It might bite us. Let's stay away." Lily said. She was scared and careful.
But Tom did not listen. He ran to the dog. The dog saw Tom and ran to him too. It jumped on Tom and licked his face. Tom laughed and petted the dog. He liked the dog.
"Lily, come here! The dog is nice. He just wants to play." Tom called to Lily.
Lily was still scared. She did not want to go near the dog. She stayed on the bench. She watched Tom and the dog.
"Tom, it's time to go home. Mom will be worried." Lily said.
"OK, Lily. But can we take the dog with us? He has no home. He can be our pet." Tom said.
"I don't know, Tom. Mom might not like a wild dog. And the dog might not like our home. He might miss the park." Lily said.
Tom thought for a moment. He liked the dog, but he also liked his home. He did not want to make the dog unhappy. He decided to let the dog go.
"Bye, dog. You are a good friend. But you belong to the park. Maybe we will see you again." Tom said. He gave the dog a hug and a treat. Then he led Lily to the gate. They waved to the dog and left.
The dog wagged his tail and barked. He was happy to meet Tom and Lily. He was also happy to stay in the park. He ran to find more friends and more fun.
