Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted to win. She was determined to be the best, so she set out on a quest. Everywhere she went, she looked for a chance to win.
One day, she came across a wild wolf. She had to be brave, but she wanted to win the challenge. She slowly approached the wolf and put out a delicious snack of berries and honey. The wolf accepted the snack and smiled.
Soon the girl was on the wolf's back, riding through the forest. She held on tight and the wolf ran faster and faster until they were the first to reach the village. The girl had won!
The villagers cheered, and the little girl was so proud of herself. She had won and she knew she could win again.
