Tom likes to play with his tank. His tank is big and green and has a long gun. He can make it go fast and make loud noises. He owns his tank and does not like to share it.
One day, Tom goes to the park with his tank. He sees a girl with a doll. The girl is nice and smiles at him. She asks him if he can play with his tank. Tom says no. He says it is his tank and he owns it. He does not want the girl to touch it.
The girl is sad and walks away. Tom feels a little bad, but he still plays with his tank. He makes it go up and down the hill. He makes it shoot at the trees. He has fun.
But then, he hears a loud snap. He looks at his tank and sees that the gun is broken. It is hanging from a thin wire. He tries to fix it, but he cannot. He is very sad. He loves his tank and now it is ruined.
He sees the girl again. She is still holding her doll. She sees his tank and sees that it is broken. She comes over and says she is sorry. She says she knows how it feels to lose something you love. She says she once had a teddy bear that her dog tore apart. She says she can help him fix his tank. She says she has some glue and tape in her backpack.
Tom is surprised. He thinks the girl is very kind. He says he is sorry too. He says he was mean to her and did not share his tank. He says he would like her to help him fix his tank. He says he would also like to play with her doll.
The girl smiles and nods. She takes out her glue and tape and helps him mend his gun. She says it will be as good as new. She gives him her doll and says he can hold it. She says it is soft and cuddly.
Tom holds the doll and feels its hair. He says it is nice. He gives her his tank and says she can drive it. He says it is fast and loud.
They play together with the tank and the doll. They have fun. They become friends. They share what they own. They are happy.
