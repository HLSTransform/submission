Once there was a little boy called Tom. One day Tom wanted to play cricket with his friends. He took out a bat and ball from his house, and he ran to the park to meet his friends. 
When he arrived at the park, he saw his friends standing together. He ran to them, but they didn't move. "Why aren't you ready to play?" Tom asked. 
His friends pointed to the ground and said, "We will play, when you find the missing cricket ball. We've been looking for it everywhere." 
Tom was very impatient. He searched and searched, but he couldn't find the ball. He had a feeling that he would never find it. 
Suddenly, he noticed something shining in a nearby bush. He rushed over and there it was, the cricket ball! Tom was so excited, he almost jumped with joy. 
His friends cheered when they saw him holding the cricket ball. "We knew you could do it," they said. 
Tom was very proud of himself. From that day onwards, he was careful to never lose anything again.
