Sam liked to bounce. He bounced on his bed, on the sofa, on the floor. He bounced with his ball, with his teddy, with his pillow. He bounced all day long.
One day, Sam saw a big dish on the table. It was shiny and round and had a lid. Sam wondered what was inside. He climbed on a chair and reached for the dish. He lifted the lid and saw a cake. It was brown and sweet and had nuts on top. Sam wanted to eat the cake.
Sam took the dish and bounced down from the chair. He bounced to the sofa and put the dish on the cushion. He bounced to the kitchen and got a fork. He bounced back to the sofa and opened the dish. He cut a big piece of cake and put it on his fork. He bounced the fork to his mouth and ate the cake. It was yummy.
But Sam ate too much cake. His tummy felt full and heavy. He could not bounce anymore. He felt sick and sleepy. He lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes. He forgot about the dish and the cake.
Mom came home and saw the dish on the sofa. She saw the cake with a big hole. She saw Sam with crumbs on his face. She was angry and sad. She said, "Sam, you are a bad boy. You ate the cake that I made for Dad. You did not ask me. You did not share. You made a mess. You are not fit to bounce." She took the dish and the cake and put them away. She cleaned the sofa and the floor. She picked up Sam and put him in his bed. She said, "You need to rest and say sorry. Maybe then you can bounce again."
