Ben and Lily went to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and giraffes. But their favorite was the seal pool. The seals were big and shiny, and they could swim and jump very fast.
"Look, Mom, the seal is doing a trick!" Lily said, pointing to a seal that balanced a ball on its nose.
"That's right, Lily, it's very clever. Do you want to record it with my phone?" Mom asked, handing Lily her phone.
"Yes, please!" Lily said, and pressed the button to record the seal. She smiled and waved at the seal, hoping it would see her.
Ben wanted to record the seal too, but he was too small to hold the phone. He felt sad and angry. He wanted to do what Lily did. He tried to grab the phone from Lily, but Lily held it tight.
"Stop, Ben, it's my turn!" Lily said, pulling the phone away.
"No, it's mine!" Ben said, pushing Lily.
"Hey, hey, stop fighting, you two!" Dad said, coming over. "You can both record the seal, but you have to take turns and share. Lily, you can record for one more minute, then give the phone to Ben. Ben, you can wait for your turn, and say sorry to Lily. OK?"
Lily and Ben nodded, and said sorry to each other. They hugged and made up. Then they took turns to record the seal, and showed Mom and Dad their videos. The seal was mighty and fun, and they were happy to watch it. They thanked Mom and Dad for taking them to the zoo, and said they loved the seal.
