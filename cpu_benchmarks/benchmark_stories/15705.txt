One day, Mommy said it was time for a party. Little Jimmy was so cheerful! He couldn't wait. He asked if he could write invitations so all his friends would come. Mommy said yes and helped him write the invitations. She wrote their names and the date of the party while Jimmy decorated them with markers. When they were done, they put them in the mail.
A few days later, Little Jimmy was so excited. He could still feel the cheerfulness in the air. Finally, the day of the party had arrived and all his friends had come! Everyone had so much fun playing together. They played so much, they were all so tired by the end.
Mommy said, "It looks like you all had a good time. You must have been very cheerful to enjoy yourselves so much". Little Jimmy smiled, he knew his party was a success.
