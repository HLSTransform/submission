There was a basketball. It was red and round. The basketball was fragile, so it had to be looked after very carefully.
One day, the basketball was taken outside. It was put on the ground. Then, something very bad happened. The basketball broke! The red ball fell into two pieces.
The little boy was very sad. The beautiful basketball was gone. He wanted to play with it, but now he couldn't.
The little boy's mommy said that it was ok. She would buy him a new basketball. They went to the shop and found a perfect new one. The little boy was happy again and ready to play!
