Molly was curious about the moon. She wondered what it looked like up close. That night, Molly decided to take a nap so she could go meet the moon. She closed her eyes and soon she was flying right up to it.
The moon was so big and beautiful. Molly was amazed. She laughed with joy as she explored the bright surface. Molly was so happy to be meeting the moon.
After playing on the moon for a while, Molly started to feel tired. She lay down, cuddled up, and closed her eyes. Before she knew it, Molly was fast asleep, dreaming of her moon adventure. 
The next morning, Molly opened her eyes and realized it had all been just a dream. But she knew that she would meet the moon soon enough. Until then, she would just keep on being curious.
