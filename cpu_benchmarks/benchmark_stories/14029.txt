Once upon a time, there was a lazy cat named Tom. He loved to sleep all day and did not want to do any work. Tom had a friend named Sue, who was a smart bird. Sue wanted to teach Tom how to fly.
One sunny day, Sue said to Tom, "I can teach you how to fly if you want to try." Tom was not sure, but he wanted to try something new. So, they went outside to start the teach.
Sue tried to show Tom how to flap his paws like wings, but Tom was not very good at it. He kept falling down, but he did not give up. After many tries, Tom managed to fly a little bit. He was happy and said, "Thank you, Sue!"
Sue was proud of Tom for not being lazy anymore. They played together in the sky, flying and having fun. From that day on, Tom was not a lazy cat anymore, and he loved to fly with his friend Sue.
