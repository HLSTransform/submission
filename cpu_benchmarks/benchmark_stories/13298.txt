One day, a busy mom was looking for a shirt to wear. She opened her drawer and saw a red shirt and a blue shirt. She did not know which one to pick. She asked her little boy, "Which shirt should I wear today?"
The little boy thought for a moment and said, "Wear the red one, mommy!"
The mom smiled and put on the red shirt. She thanked her little boy and gave him a big hug. They both felt happy and went to play outside in the sun.
