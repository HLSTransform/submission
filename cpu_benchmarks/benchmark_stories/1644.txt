Once upon a time, there was a kid named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy's mom took him to the store to buy some candy. But when they got there, Timmy couldn't find his favorite candy.
Timmy started to weep because he was so sad that he couldn't find his candy. His mom tried to help him find it, but they looked everywhere and couldn't find it. Timmy was confused and didn't know what to do.
But then, Timmy's mom had an idea. She suggested they try a different store to find the candy. Timmy was happy again and they went to another store. And guess what? They found the candy! Timmy was so happy that he stopped weeping and gave his mom a big hug.
