Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily had her birthday. She was very happy and excited because she was going to have a big party with all her friends. She wanted to have a big cake and lots of balloons.
But when her mom went to buy the balloons, she found out they were all sold out. Lily was sad and started to cry. Her dad tried to cheer her up and said, "Don't worry, we can still have fun. Let's play a game where we fly like birds!" Lily loved the idea and started to flap her arms like wings.
Her dad was very flexible and could do lots of tricks. He showed Lily how to do a somersault in the air. Lily tried and tried, but she couldn't do it. She started to cry again and said, "I can't do it! This is the worst birthday ever!"
Her dad hugged her and said, "It's okay to feel frustrated, but we can keep trying until we get it right. And remember, even if we can't fly like birds, we can still have fun together." Lily smiled and hugged her dad back. They spent the rest of the day playing and laughing together.
