Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream very much, especially the different flavors. One day, she went to the ice cream truck and asked for a scoop of strawberry cream. 
The ice cream man said, "Sorry, we don't have strawberry today. Would you like to try a different flavor?" 
Lily thought for a moment and said, "Okay, I'll try chocolate." 
As she was enjoying her ice cream, her friend Timmy came over. "What flavor did you get?" he asked. 
"I got chocolate," Lily replied. 
Timmy said, "I don't like chocolate. Can I try a different flavor?" 
Lily smiled and said, "Sure, let's go ask the ice cream man what flavors he has." 
Together, they went to the ice cream truck and found a flavor they both liked. They were happy to have come up with a solution that made them both happy.
