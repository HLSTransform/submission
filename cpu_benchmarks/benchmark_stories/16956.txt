Tim and Lily went to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and elephants. Tim liked the elephants best, because they had big trunks and ears. Lily liked the monkeys best, because they made funny noises and jumped around.
Then they came to the ostriches. Ostriches are big birds with long necks and legs. They can run very fast, but they cannot fly. Tim and Lily wanted to feed the ostriches, so they bought some seeds from a man. The man told them to be careful, because ostriches can be stubborn and peck.
Tim and Lily walked to the fence, where some ostriches were waiting. Tim held out his hand with some seeds, and an ostrich came closer. It ate the seeds from his hand, and Tim laughed. He said, "Hello, ostrich. You are nice."
Lily wanted to try too, but she had a different idea. She took her cup of water, and poured it on the ostrich's head. The ostrich was not happy. It shook its head, and made a loud noise. It pecked at Lily's cup, and made it fall. Lily cried, "Ow, ostrich. You are mean."
Mom and Dad heard Lily cry, and ran to her. They saw what happened, and were not pleased. They said, "Lily, why did you pour water on the ostrich? That was not nice. You scared the ostrich, and made it angry. You should say sorry to the ostrich, and to the man."
Lily felt bad. She said, "Sorry, ostrich. Sorry, man. I was silly. I will not pour water on you again." The ostrich looked at her, and nodded. The man smiled, and gave her a new cup of water. He said, "It's okay, Lily. Ostriches can be stubborn, but they can also be friendly. Next time, just give them some seeds, and they will like you."
Tim and Lily learned a lesson. They fed the ostriches some more seeds, and the ostriches ate them happily. They said, "Bye, ostriches. You are cool." The ostriches said, "Bye, Tim and Lily. You are kind." Tim and Lily hugged Mom and Dad, and went to see more animals. They had a fun day at the zoo.
