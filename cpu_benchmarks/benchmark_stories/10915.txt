Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had an old teddy bear that she loved very much. One day, Lily went outside to play and saw a big, bright light in the sky. She looked up and saw a shooting star! She made a wish and closed her eyes tight.
Later that day, Lily went to her grandma's house. Her grandma had made cookies that smelled so good. Lily took a bite and could taste the chocolate chips. "Yum!" she said. Her grandma told her that the recipe was very old and had been passed down in the family for generations. Lily felt special knowing that she was eating something that her ancestors had enjoyed too.
