Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to draw with his pen. He drew a picture of a car with his pen. Then, he got tired and wanted to sit down. 
Timmy's mom saw him and asked, "Are you tired, Timmy?" 
Timmy said, "Yes, Mommy. I want to seat down." 
His mom said, "Okay, let's find a seat for you." 
They found a big chair and Timmy sat down. He looked at his picture and smiled. "I like my car," he said. 
His mom smiled too and said, "You did a great job with your pen, Timmy. I'm proud of you." 
Timmy felt happy and not tired anymore. He hugged his mom and said, "Thank you, Mommy."
