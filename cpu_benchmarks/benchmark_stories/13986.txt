Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore new places. One day, she went on an adventure to the east, where the sun rises. She walked and walked until she found a brilliant flower. It was the most beautiful flower she had ever seen.
Lily picked up the flower and held it in her hand. Suddenly, a mean dog appeared and started barking at her. Lily got scared and ran away, but the dog chased her. She tried to hold onto the flower, but it slipped out of her hand and fell on the ground. The dog caught up to her and bit her leg. Lily cried out for help, but no one was around to hear her.
Eventually, Lily managed to escape from the dog and run back home. Her leg hurt badly and she was sad about losing the brilliant flower. Her mom asked her what happened and Lily told her the whole story. Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm so glad you're okay, but next time, don't go on an adventure alone." Lily learned her lesson and promised to always be careful.
