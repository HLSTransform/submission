Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride the subway with his mommy. One day, they got on the subway and Timmy saw a balloon. He wanted it so badly, but his mommy said they couldn't buy it.
Timmy was sad, but then he saw another boy who looked sad too. The boy had dropped his toy car and it rolled away. Timmy picked it up and gave it back to the boy. The boy was happy and thanked Timmy.
Suddenly, the subway stopped and the doors wouldn't open. Everyone was scared, but Timmy's mommy told him to release his seat belt and they could escape through the window. Timmy was scared, but he did it and they all got out safely. Timmy felt fit and strong for helping the other boy and for being brave on the subway.
