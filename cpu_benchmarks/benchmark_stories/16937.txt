Sara and Ben liked to play pirates. They had a big box that they pretended was a chest full of gold and jewels. They hid the chest under a blanket in their room and made a map to find it.
One day, their mom said they had to clean their room. She said they had to remove all the toys and books from the floor and put them away. Sara and Ben did not want to do that. They wanted to play with their chest.
They had an idea. They took the blanket off the chest and put it on the floor. Then they put all their toys and books on top of the blanket. They thought their mom would not see the chest.
They were wrong. Their mom came in and saw the big pile of stuff on the floor. She was not happy. She told them to remove the blanket and show her what was under it. Sara and Ben felt scared. They knew they were in trouble.
They removed the blanket and showed their mom the chest. Their mom looked at it and smiled. She said she liked their playful imagination. She said they could keep the chest, but they had to put away the toys and books first. Sara and Ben were happy. They hugged their mom and said they were sorry. They cleaned their room and then played with their chest. They had fun being pirates.
