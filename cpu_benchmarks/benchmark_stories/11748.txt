One day, Toby the Tiger was packing for his big trip. He was so excited! Toby was going to the Jungle Adventure to compete for a shiny gold medal. He was filled with joy!
As he packed, Toby's mommy gave him some advice. "Be careful. You know you are a bit clumsy!"
Toby nodded. He knew that he was not the most graceful of tigers, but he was determined to make his mom proud.
Finally, Toby finished packing and was ready to go. He said goodbye to his family and hurried off to the Jungle Adventure. 
As he arrived, Toby noticed some of his friends and competitors. He was nervous. What if he didn't win the gold medal? 
But Toby kept his courage. He climbed each obstacle and felt more confident with each step. Finally, Toby won the gold medal! Feeling proud and relieved, he ran back to show his family. 
Sure enough, Toby's mom was beaming with joy when she saw the shiny medal in Toby's paws! She was proud of her clumsy, brave tiger for winning such a big prize.
