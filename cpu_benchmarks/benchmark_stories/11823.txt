Once upon a time, there was a girl called Sara. She had a huge pen that she loved. Every day, she went for a walk with it.
One day, she was walking with her pen and she saw a huge rabbit. She was so excited and ran towards it. Before she could get close, the rabbit hopped away.
Sara chased the rabbit, with her pen in her hand. Eventually she got too close and the rabbit got scared. The rabbit became very angry and ran at Sara.
The rabbit was too fast and knocked the pen out of Sara's hand. The pen rolled away and stopped at a cliff. Sara tried to get her pen back, but she was too slow. The pen fell over the edge and vanished.
Sara was so sad. She had lost her huge pen forever.
