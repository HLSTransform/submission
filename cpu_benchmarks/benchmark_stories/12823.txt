Once upon a time, there were two best friends, Tommy and Jack. Tommy loved to dance. Every day, he would twirl and spin and jump. But Jack wanted to make sand castles at the beach.
One day, Tommy and Jack went to the beach. Tommy started dancing right away but Jack wanted to build a sandcastle. They started to argue and finally, Tommy said "Let's make a big sandcastle and when the tide comes in, we can dance in the purple water!"
Jack thought it was a great idea. They worked together to carefully stack the sand just right. When the purple tide came in, they both jumped with joy. They laughed as they felt the purple water splash beneath their feet.
Before long, they had so much fun dancing that they forgot all about the sand castle they had made. The purple tide started to go back out and the sand castle was gone. 
Tommy and Jack hugged and agreed to never forget to play together. Even if they do different things, they'll always be best friends.
