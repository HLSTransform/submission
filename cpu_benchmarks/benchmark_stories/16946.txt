Anna liked to draw with her crayons. She had many colors to choose from. She drew a big house, a happy sun, and a green tree. She was proud of her picture.
But then she saw a mistake. She had drawn a blue cloud instead of a white one. She wanted to fix it. She looked for her eraser. She had a pink eraser with a unicorn on it. She loved her eraser.
She found her eraser under her bed. She picked it up and went back to her picture. She rubbed the blue cloud with her eraser. But the eraser did not work. It only made the paper dirty. She tried harder, but the paper tore. She was sad and angry.
She threw her eraser on the floor. She cried. "Bad eraser! You ruined my picture!"
Her mom heard her cry. She came to her room. She saw the torn picture and the eraser. She hugged Anna and said, "It's okay, sweetie. It was an accident. You can make another picture. And you can choose a different eraser. Look, I have a new one for you. It's yellow and has a star on it. It's a brilliant eraser. It can erase any color. Do you want to try it?"
Anna stopped crying. She looked at the new eraser. It was shiny and pretty. She smiled. She said, "Yes, please. Thank you, mom. You are brilliant, too." She took the new eraser and started to draw again. She was happy.
