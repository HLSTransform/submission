Once upon a time, there was a naughty crane. He liked to play tricks on his animal friends. One day, he saw a pretty butterfly and wanted to catch it. He tried to bow down to catch it, but the butterfly flew away. 
The crane felt sad and decided to apologize to his friends. He went to the pond and saw his friend, the duck. The crane bowed his head and said sorry. The duck forgave him and they played together. 
From that day on, the crane was not naughty anymore. He learned to be kind to his friends and they all had fun together. The butterfly even came back and they all watched it fly around. The end.
