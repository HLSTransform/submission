One day, a boy named Tim went to the park with his kite. He was very excited to play with it. The sky was blue and the sun was shining. It was a perfect day to fly a kite.
When Tim got to the park, he saw his friend, Lily. She was looking at a flower. "I examine the flower," said Lily. "It is weak and needs water." Tim looked at the flower too. He agreed with Lily. They decided to find some water to help the flower.
They found a small cup and filled it with water from a nearby fountain. They went back to the weak flower and gave it water. The flower looked better now. Tim and Lily smiled at each other. They were happy to help the flower.
Now, it was time to fly the kite. Tim and Lily ran across the grass, holding the kite. It went up into the sky, dancing with the wind. They laughed and played until the sun began to set. It was a fun day at the park for Tim and Lily.
