Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was very smart and loved to play. One day, Spot was outside playing when he saw lightning in the sky. Lightning is very bright and moves very fast. Spot was scared and ran inside to hide under his blanket. 
But then, Spot had an idea! He remembered that his friend, a toy robot, had a light on his head. Spot thought that if he could turn on the light, it would make him feel safe. So, Spot went to his toy box and found the robot. He turned on the light and it made him feel better. 
From that day on, Spot and his smart robot friend played together all the time. They would run and jump and the robot's light would move all around. Spot was happy to have such a good friend who could help him feel safe when he was scared of the lightning. The end.
