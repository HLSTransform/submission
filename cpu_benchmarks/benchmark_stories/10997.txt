Tom and Anna like to play with their toys. They have cars, dolls, blocks and books. But their favorite toy is a rocket. The rocket is big and red and has a window. They pretend to be astronauts and fly to space.
One day, they ask their mom if they can raise the rocket. They want to see how high it can go. Mom says yes, but they have to be careful. She gives them a string and a balloon. They tie the string to the rocket and the balloon to the string. The balloon is full of air and makes the rocket go up.
"Wow, look at our rocket!" Tom says. "It is so high!"
"Yes, it is!" Anna says. "Maybe it can reach space!"
They watch the rocket fly in the sky. They see birds, clouds and the sun. They wave to the rocket and pretend to talk to it.
"Hello, rocket!" Tom says. "How is space?"
"Space is fun!" Anna says in a funny voice. "I see stars and planets!"
They laugh and have fun. They are happy with their rocket. They hope it will come back soon. They love to play with their rocket.
