Sara and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big sack on the grass. They ran to the sack and opened it. Inside the sack, they found many toys and books.
"Wow, look at all these things!" Sara said. "Who left them here?"
"I don't know, maybe someone forgot them," Ben said. "Can we play with them?"
Sara nodded. They took out some toys and books and started to play. They had a lot of fun.
But then, a man came to the park. He looked angry. He saw the sack and the children.
"Hey, what are you doing with my sack?" he shouted. "That's mine! Give it back!"
Sara and Ben were scared. They dropped the toys and books and ran away. The man chased them.
"Stop, you little thieves!" he yelled. "I'll catch you!"
Sara and Ben ran as fast as they could. They saw a woman sitting on a bench. She had a kind face and a long neck. She was reading a book.
"Help us, please!" Sara and Ben cried. "That man is after us!"
The woman looked up. She saw the man and the sack. She was wise. She understood what happened.
"Don't worry, children, I'll help you," she said. She stood up and blocked the man's way.
"Leave them alone, sir," she said. "They didn't know the sack was yours. They were just curious and wanted to play. They didn't mean any harm."
The man stopped. He looked at the woman and the children. He felt ashamed.
"I'm sorry, ma'am, I overreacted," he said. "I was worried someone would steal my sack. It has some gifts for my grandchildren. I should have been more careful."
He picked up his sack and walked away. He said sorry to Sara and Ben.
The woman smiled. She hugged Sara and Ben.
"It's okay, children, you're safe now," she said. "But remember, don't touch things that don't belong to you. Always ask first."
Sara and Ben nodded. They thanked the woman. They learned a lesson. They went back to their parents and told them what happened. They were happy and grateful.
