Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in her garden. One day, she found a big rock. It was easy for her to pick up and she held it in her hand. She wanted to reach the top of the hill with the rock. 
Lily started to walk up the hill. She climbed and climbed. The rock felt heavy in her hand. But she didn't give up. She kept going until she reached the top of the hill. She was so happy! 
Lily looked around and saw a beautiful view. She saw the trees, the flowers, and the blue sky. She decided to put the rock down and sit on it. She felt proud of herself for reaching the top of the hill with the rock. From that day on, Lily would always remember how she climbed the hill with the big rock, and how it made her feel strong and happy.
