A happy little girl named Emma was walking in the park. She was feeling curious, so she looked around at the different creatures. Suddenly she saw a bird with a broken wing. Emma felt very sad and wished she could help it.
"I hate seeing birds with broken wings," she said.
Suddenly a kind old lady appeared. "I know what you can do," she said.
The old lady said they should care for the bird and find a way to help it. Emma was so thankful, and with the old lady's help she was able to care for the bird and give it something to eat. 
Soon enough, the bird was healthy and flew away into the sky.
The moral of the story is that no matter how small you are, you can still make a difference. With a little bit of kindness, even the most difficult of times are possible to overcome.
