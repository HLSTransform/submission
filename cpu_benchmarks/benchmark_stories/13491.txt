Once upon a time, there was a big brown bear named Bobby. Bobby was very hungry and wanted to eat a honeycomb. So, he went to the beehive and saw that the bees were very busy making honey. Bobby waited patiently until the bees were ready with the honey.
When the bees were done, Bobby asked if he could have some honey. The bees agreed and gave him a wide jar full of honey. Bobby was so happy and wanted to take the honey home. The bees helped Bobby wrap the jar with a cloth so that it wouldn't break on the way home.
Bobby thanked the bees and went home. He enjoyed the honey very much and was very grateful to the bees for their kindness. From that day on, Bobby would often visit the bees and they became good friends.
