John and his dad were walking in the park. When they got to the sunniest spot they saw their friend Bill. Bill was up high in a tree and he waved to them. John's dad nodded at Bill, then they kept walking. After a while they came to a lake, and they saw something else. It was an old man with a blanket. The old man was sitting on the side of the lake. He had news for them.
John's dad listened carefully and he nodded again. The old man said that his daughter had gone missing near the lake. Dad looked very worried and started walking around the lake, searching for clues. But nothing could be found.
John tried to reach high and look around but he couldn't see anything. Dad was tired from walking around the lake and they had to go back home.
John and his dad left the park sad and worried. The news they had was bad, and they would never know what really happened to the old man's daughter. They nodded at each other, and knew they'd have to keep searching.
