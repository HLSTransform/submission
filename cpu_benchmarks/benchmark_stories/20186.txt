Tim and Liz are friends. They like to play in the park. They like to slide and swing and run. They are happy.
One day, they see a big jar of sauce on a bench. The sauce is red and shiny. It looks yummy. Tim and Liz are hungry. They hope no one is looking. They run to the bench and grab the jar.
But the jar is not easy to open. Tim and Liz twist and pull and shake. The jar is very tight. They try harder and harder. They are angry.
Then, the jar pops open. But the sauce flies out. The sauce goes everywhere. It goes on Tim and Liz. It goes on the bench. It goes on the slide and the swing and the grass. It goes on a dog and a bird and a man.
The dog barks. The bird flies away. The man yells. He is the owner of the sauce. He is very mad. He runs to Tim and Liz. He grabs the jar. He scolds them. He tells them to go away. He tells them they are bad.
Tim and Liz are sad. They are sorry. They are messy. They have no sauce. They have no fun. They walk away. They are not friends anymore.
