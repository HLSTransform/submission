Morty and his mommy were playing in the park. It was a sunny day and there was a lot to do and see.
Mommy said, "Look! There's a cop!"
Morty was impressed. He asked, "What's a cop, Mommy?"
Mommy explained, "A cop is an intelligent person who helps people in the park."
Morty thought that sounded fun and he asked, "Can I visit the cop?"
So Morty and Mommy walked over to the cop. Morty said, "Hello! I'm Morty. I wanted to visit you."
The cop smiled and said, "It's nice to meet you, Morty. I'm here to help people if they need it. So if you ever need help, just let me know."
Morty thanked the cop and then he and his mommy went back to playing in the park. Morty had had a special visit and he wouldn't forget it anytime soon.
