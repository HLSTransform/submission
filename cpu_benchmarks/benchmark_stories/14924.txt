Once upon a time there was a mighty man. He had a big bike with a big wheel and a strong pedal. The man decided to push his bike to the top of the hill. He pushed with all of his might and he huffed and he puffed. He pushed and he pushed until finally he made it to the top. The man was so proud of the pedal he had pushed! Then the man roared in excitement. "Wheeee!" He shouted, enjoying the view from the top of the hill. He was so glad he pushed his bike uphill.
