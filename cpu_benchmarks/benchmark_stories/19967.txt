Anna loved to play dress-up with her big sister, Lily. Lily had many costumes in her closet, like a fairy, a pirate, a princess, and a doctor. Anna liked to try them on and pretend to be different people.
One day, Lily had a friend over, and they wanted to play dress-up too. Anna wanted to join them, but Lily said no. She said Anna was too little and would ruin the costumes. Anna felt sad and angry. She went to her room and cried.
She decided to make her own costume. She found a big cardboard box and some crayons. She cut out a hole for her head and two holes for her arms. She drew a face on the front of the box and wrote "ROBOT" on the back. She put the box over her body and went to show Lily and her friend.
Lily and her friend were playing with the fairy and the pirate costumes. They saw Anna coming and laughed. They said her costume was silly and ugly. They said she was not a robot, but a box. Anna felt hurt and embarrassed. She ran away.
She bumped into her mom, who was in the kitchen. Her mom saw her costume and smiled. She said it was very creative and clever. She said she was proud of Anna for making her own costume. She said she looked like a friendly robot. She gave her a hug and a cookie.
Anna felt happy and loved. She thanked her mom and ate the cookie. She decided she did not need Lily's costumes. She had her own costume and her own imagination. She went to the living room and played with her toys. She pretended to be a friendly robot who helped people and animals. She had fun.
