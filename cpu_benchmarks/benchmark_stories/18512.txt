Lila and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big loop on the grass. It is shiny and red.
"Let's spin in the loop!" Lila says. "It looks fun!"
"OK!" Tom says. "You go first!"
Lila runs to the loop. She puts her feet inside and holds the sides. She pushes with her legs and spins around. She feels happy and dizzy. She laughs.
"Wow, you are fast!" Tom says. "Can I try?"
"Yes, of course!" Lila says. She stops spinning and gets out of the loop. She gives it to Tom.
Tom gets in the loop. He spins too. He spins faster and faster. He feels the wind on his face. He smiles.
"This is awesome!" Tom says. "Thank you for sharing!"
"You're welcome!" Lila says. "You are a friendly friend!"
They spin in the loop together. They have a lot of fun. They are happy.
