Lily and Ben are friends. They like to go to the park and play. One day, they see a big board near the slide. The board is red and shiny. It looks fun.
"Let's go on the board!" Lily says. She is playful and curious.
"OK!" Ben says. He is playful too. They run to the board and climb on it.
The board is not a board. It is a car. A bad man is in the car. He sees Lily and Ben on his car. He is angry and mean.
"Hey, get off my car!" he yells. He starts the car and drives away.
Lily and Ben are scared. They scream and cry. They want to go back to the park. They want to see their moms and dads. But the bad man does not stop. He takes them far away.
The end.
