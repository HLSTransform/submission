One day, a doctor set out to help people who were sick. He walked down the street with his bag of tools. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.
As he walked, he saw an empty park. The doctor thought it was a good place to take a break. He sat on a bench and ate his lunch. He saw some kids playing and smiled.
After his break, the doctor set off again to help more people. He went to their houses and made them feel better. At the end of the day, the doctor was happy because he helped many people. He went home and took a rest.
