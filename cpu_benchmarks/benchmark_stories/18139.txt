Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a big house with a garden. Lily's mommy and daddy were very rich, so they could buy her lots of toys. Lily loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. She also had a big foot, which she used to stomp around the house.
One day, Lily wanted to own a new toy. She asked her mommy and daddy, but they said she already had enough toys. Lily was sad, so she went outside to play in the garden. She saw a butterfly and started to chase it. Suddenly, she saw a shiny coin on the ground. She picked it up and ran back inside to show her mommy and daddy. They were very happy and proud of her. They said she could use the coin to buy a new toy. Lily was very happy and hugged her mommy and daddy with her big foot.
