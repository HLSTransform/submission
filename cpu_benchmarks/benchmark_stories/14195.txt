Once upon a time, there was a black bird that loved to soar in the sky and feel the wind on its wings. One day, the bird flew close to a lake, but it was so taken by the beautiful lake that it forgot to watch where it was going. As a result, the bird flew right into the lake, getting wet in the process.
The black bird was so embarrassed, it decided to never fly close to the lake again. Instead, it made sure to look where it was going and to always be careful.
This is an important lesson â€“ when you are enjoying something, it is important to remember to be cautious and mindful of your surroundings and of possible dangers. If you do, you will be able to stay out of trouble and keep having fun!
