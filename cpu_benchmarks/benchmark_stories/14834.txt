Tom and Anna are friends. They like to play on the farm. The farm has many animals. There are cows, pigs, sheep, chickens and a dog.
One day, Tom and Anna want to take the dog for a walk. They ask the farmer if they can.
"Can we take the dog for a walk, please?" Tom says.
"Sure, but be careful. The dog likes to run and chase things. Don't go too far," the farmer says.
Tom and Anna nod. They put a leash on the dog and say goodbye to the farmer. They walk with the dog around the farm. They see the cows, the pigs, the sheep and the chickens. The dog barks and wags his tail. He is happy.
"Look, the dog is happy. He likes the farm," Anna says.
"Yes, he does. And so do we. The farm is fun," Tom says.
They walk and play with the dog for a long time. They are happy too. They love the farm and the animals. They are good friends.
