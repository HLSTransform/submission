John was a careless boy. He never studied for his exams. He was always running and playing about, whether it was in the park or at school.
One day, a big exam was coming up. But John didn't care. He slept late at night, not worrying about the exam.
His father was angry with him. He tried to tell John to study and be careful. But John didn't listen.
The day of the exam came and John wasn't prepared. When he went to take the exam, he was so tired that he made careless mistakes.
John's father was disappointed with him. He said, "If you don't work hard, you are sure to spoil the exam!"
