Once upon a time there was a happy fox called Jack. Every morning he would jog around the big forest where he lived so that he could get strong and healthy. One morning as Jack was running he saw an ink bottle that was lying on the ground, so he decided to pick it up and have a look.
Inside the bottle was a giant ink blob. Jack stared at the blob in amazement and said out loud: "How strange! What can I do with this blob of ink?" Just then, he heard a little voice from behind a nearby bush.
Jack was very surprised and he looked around to see who was speaking. A little leprechaun emerged from the bush and said to Jack: "I know what you can do with my ink! You can make beautiful pictures with it!"
Jack was very excited. He asked the leprechaun: "Where can I get some paper to make pictures with this ink?" "Don't worry," replied the leprechaun, "I can make paper available for you. It is waiting for you up the hill."
Jack thanked the leprechaun and started to jog to the top of the hill. When he arrived, he saw that the leprechaun was right - there was a big pile of paper waiting for him.
Jack was very happy. He grabbed some paper and some ink and he started to make beautiful pictures. From then on, every morning
