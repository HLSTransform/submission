Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to play in the field. She would run and jump and pick flowers. One day, while playing, she stumbled and fell down. Ouch! She hurt her knee.
Lily cried and cried, but then she saw a gentle lady walking by. The lady saw that Lily was hurt and came over to help. She gave Lily a band-aid and a hug. Lily felt better and thanked the gentle lady.
But then, Lily noticed that her favorite flower was too far away to reach. She wanted it so badly but didn't know how to get it. The gentle lady saw how sad Lily was and offered to help her get the flower. Together, they walked to the flower and picked it. Lily was so happy and grateful to have a new friend. From that day on, they played in the field together and had lots of fun.
