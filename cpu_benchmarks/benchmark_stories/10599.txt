Once upon a time, there were two friends, Pete and Ben. Pete was rich while Ben was poor. Pete invited Ben over to his house to share his tea.
Ben was so excited to have a rich friend that could invite him to his own house! When Pete and Ben were together, they liked to shoot things with their toy guns. One day, Pete noticed that Ben's gun was broken. Pete had an extra gun and offered it to Ben.
Ben was very grateful to Peter and thanked him, but Pete said, "No, this is a sharing time. If I give you my gun, then I have nothing of my own left to share with you." Ben understood what Pete meant and so he said, "That's okay, which toy shall we shoot together with your gun?"
This was a moral lesson for both Ben and Pete. No matter the differences between the two friends, both can share the same things if they truly look out for each other. All the tea in the world cannot make up for the value of true friendship!
