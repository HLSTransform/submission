Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine and run around with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends found a track in the dirt. They followed the track and it led them to a little bird.
The bird looked sad and thoughtful. Lily whispered to her friends, "I think the bird needs our help." They all agreed and decided to make a little nest for the bird out of sticks and leaves.
After they made the nest, they gently picked up the bird and put it inside. They watched as the bird snuggled into the nest and looked much happier. Lily and her friends were so proud of themselves for helping the little bird.
The moral of the story is that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.
