Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Bubbles. Bubbles lived in a tank with his friends. One day, Bubbles saw a big rock and he wanted to play with it. But the rock was too heavy and Bubbles struggled to move it.
Bubbles said, "I can't move this rock. It's too heavy!"
His friend, Goldie, said, "Be careful, Bubbles. The tank is fragile. We don't want to break it."
Bubbles tried and tried to move the rock but he couldn't. Suddenly, the tank started to shake and Bubbles realized he had accidentally hit the tank with the rock. The tank cracked and water started to spill out. 
Bubbles felt sad and said, "I'm sorry, Goldie. I didn't mean to break the tank."
Goldie replied, "It's okay, Bubbles. We can fix it together. Let's ask our owner for help." 
So, Bubbles and Goldie asked their owner for help and together they fixed the tank. Bubbles learned that even though he struggled to move the rock, he should always be careful and think about the fragility of things around him.
