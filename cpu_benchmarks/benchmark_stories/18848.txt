Sara liked to question everything. She always asked why, how, and what. She wanted to learn new things and understand the world. Her mom and dad liked her curiosity, but sometimes they got tired of answering so many questions.
One day, Sara saw a cake on the table. It was round and brown and had white cream on top. It looked yummy, but it was different from the cakes she had before. She wondered what it was made of and how it tasted. She asked her mom, "What is this cake?"
Her mom smiled and said, "This is a chocolate cake. It is made of flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and cocoa. Cocoa is a powder that comes from a plant and gives the cake a brown color and a sweet flavor. Do you want to try a piece?"
Sara nodded eagerly. She loved sweets and wanted to try new things. Her mom cut a small slice and gave it to her on a plate. Sara took a bite and felt the soft cake and the smooth cream in her mouth. She liked the taste very much. It was sweet and rich and different from the other cakes she had before. She said, "Mmm, this is good. Thank you, mom."
Her mom hugged her and said, "You're welcome, Sara. I'm glad you like it. You can have another piece later, but first you have to eat your lunch. Do you have any more questions?"
Sara thought for a moment. She still had many questions, but she decided to save them for later. She said, "No, mom. I'm ready to eat my lunch. But can I ask you something later?"
Her mom nodded and said, "Of course, Sara. You can always ask me anything. I love your questions. They show me how smart and curious you are."
