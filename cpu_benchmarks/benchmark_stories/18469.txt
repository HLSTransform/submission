Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys, especially his toy cars. One day, Timmy's dad brought home a new toy car that was very cool. It had big wheels and could go very fast.
Timmy wanted to test out his new toy car, so he brought it outside to play. He put the car on the ground and watched it go. It went so fast that it hit Timmy's arm! Timmy wasn't hurt, but he knew he needed to be careful when playing with his new toy.
From that day on, Timmy always made sure to keep his arms out of the way when testing out his cool toy cars.
