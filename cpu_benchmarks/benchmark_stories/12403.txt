Once upon a time, there were two friends - a rabbit and a bear. They were very excited as today was their special day - a day to celebrate!
The bear grabbed the rabbit's paw and said, "Let's go and watch the ugly television to make our special day even more fun!"
They hopped excitedly all the way to the bear's house and quickly turned on the television. They were so mesmerized by the colorful moving pictures, they couldn't pull their eyes away.
It was so much fun that they decided to celebrate their day together every year.
The bear and the rabbit laughed and cheered and had the best time. They would always remember this special day and all the fun they had. They even promised to watch the ugly television to celebrate every year.
