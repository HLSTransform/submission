Once upon a time, there was a boy who was very nervous. He was nervous because he had to stand up in front of a lot of people. He was scared to say the word. He felt his heart beating faster and faster.
The boy went to his mum to give him courage. Mum said, “Remember, you can do it. It's OK to be a bit scared, just take a few deep breaths.”
The boy felt better. He took a few deep breaths and then he walked up to the microphone. He felt a little bit less scared.
When it was his turn, he said the word! Everyone clapped and cheered and the boy felt very happy. He wasn't so nervous anymore.
From then on he always tried to be brave when he felt a bit scared. He knew that if he could say that one word, he could do anything!
