Once upon a time there was a girl named Jenny. She was very eager to go outside and play. She put her shoes on and ran to the door. But, the door wouldn't open.
Jenny saw a cord hanging down from the top of the door. She tugged it gently and the door suddenly opened! She shouted with joy.
But then, a rude man stepped in front of Jenny. He said that she had to hurry out, as he was in a rush. Jenny was sad, but she quickly ran out of the door.
Outside, Jenny could go wherever she wanted! She was so happy that she had found the cord to open the door.
