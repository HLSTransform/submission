Once there was a bird who loved to fly. He flew above the trees and up into the sky. He felt free as he soar in the air. One day while he was flying he saw a match on the ground. He wondered how he could get to it. Suddenly he had an idea! He swooped down and picked it up with his beak.
He took the match to an organized area and made a game of it. He used sticks and leaves to make a track. He put the match on the track and then flew quickly around it. The match twirled around and around, zig zagging back and forth. The bird had a lot of fun watching the match fly!
