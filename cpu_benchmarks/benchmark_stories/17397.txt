Tom likes to wander in the park. He likes to see the birds, the flowers and the big trees. He likes to run and jump and play with his ball. He is very fit and has strong muscles.
One day, he wanders too far. He does not see his mom or his dad. He does not see the bench where they sit. He does not see the path where they walk. He sees a big pond with ducks and frogs. He wants to go closer and look.
But he does not see the sign that says "No Swimming". He does not see the mud that is slippery and wet. He steps on the mud and falls into the pond. He is scared and cold and wet. He cries for help.
His mom and his dad hear him cry. They run to the pond and see him in the water. They are scared and worried and angry. They pull him out of the pond and hug him tight. They tell him he is safe and they love him. They tell him he was naughty and he should not wander away.
Tom is sorry and sad. He says he is sorry and he loves them. He says he will not wander away again. He says he will listen and obey. He says he will be a good boy. He is still fit and has strong muscles. But he learns to be careful and smart.
