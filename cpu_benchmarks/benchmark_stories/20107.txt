Ben and Lily liked to play in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. One day, they saw something unusual in the pond. It was an otter. The otter was brown and furry. It had a long tail and whiskers.
"Look, Lily, an otter!" Ben said.
"Wow, Ben, it is so cute!" Lily said.
They went closer to the pond. The otter saw them and swam to them. It had something in its mouth. It was a letter. The letter had a stamp and an address.
"Hello, otter, what do you have?" Ben asked.
The otter made a funny noise and gave them the letter. Ben and Lily opened the letter. It was from their grandma. She wrote that she missed them and sent them a picture of her and her cat.
"Thank you, otter, for mailing us this letter!" Lily said.
The otter nodded and smiled. It splashed in the water and waved goodbye. Ben and Lily waved back. They were happy to get a letter from their grandma. They were also happy to meet an unusual otter. They decided to write a letter back and mail it to their grandma. Maybe the otter would help them again.
