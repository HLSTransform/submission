Once upon a time there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was three years old and he was always curious about the world outside his home. One day Tom decided he wanted to see what the world was really like. He opened the door and walked outside.
It was daytime and the sun was shining on Tom. Everything was so light and bright that Tom was amazed. He started walking and soon he saw a big, green tree. Tom had never seen a tree before! He wanted to take a closer look.
Tom approached the tree, but as soon as he got close, a bug bit him! Tom screamed and ran back home. He was scared and did not want to go back outside.
Tom's mom heard him screaming and came to help him. She told him that the bug just wanted to taste him, to make sure he was not a snack! She said that the bug was only being friendly. From then on, Tom respected the bugs and all the animals he found outside the safety of his home.
