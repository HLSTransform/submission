Once upon a time, there lived two boys who were best friends. They always played together and had so much fun.
One day, the boys went outside to play and they decided to explore a cave. When they went inside, they saw a bright spirit. It was buzzing with energy and looked very special.
The boys were very curious and wanted to touch it, but the spirit said to them, "You must not touch me! I am too important and must stay here."
The boys were disappointed, but they said, "Ok, we understand. We will not touch you."
But then one of the boys had an idea. He suggested that if they asked nicely, the spirit would allow them to touch it. The other boy thought this was a great idea and so they asked the spirit nicely if they could touch it.
The spirit allowed them to touch it and the boys felt a great joy that they had never felt before. The spirit was so important that it made them feel special. They thanked the spirit and continued to explore the cave. From that day on, they would often come back to the cave and talk to the spirit.
