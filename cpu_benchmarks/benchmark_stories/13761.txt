Ben and Mia like to play with their toy box. They have many toys, like cars, dolls, blocks and animals. But their favorite toy is a big truck. The truck has wheels, a horn, a door and a screw.
One day, Ben and Mia want to play with the truck. But they see that the screw is loose. The screw holds the door of the truck. If the screw falls out, the door will fall off too. Ben and Mia do not want that to happen.
"Let's fix the screw," Ben says. He takes a tool from the toy box. It is a small hammer. He tries to hit the screw with the hammer. But it is difficult. The screw is too small and the hammer is too big. Ben misses the screw and hits his finger. "Ow!" he cries.
"That is not the right tool," Mia says. She takes another tool from the toy box. It is a small wrench. She tries to twist the screw with the wrench. But it is difficult. The screw is too tight and the wrench is too slippery. Mia slips the wrench and scratches the truck. "Oh no!" she says.
Ben and Mia are sad. They do not know how to fix the screw. They do not want to break the truck. They look at the toy box. They see one more tool. It is a small screwdriver. They have never used it before.
"Maybe this is the right tool," Ben says. He takes the screwdriver and puts it in the screw. He turns it slowly. The screw moves. It is not difficult. Ben smiles. He turns the screw until it is tight. The door of the truck is fixed.
"Yay! You did it!" Mia says. She hugs Ben. They are happy. They spend the rest of the day playing with the truck. They make noises, drive around and pretend to go on adventures. They love their truck and their screwdriver. They put them back in the toy box when they are done. They say thank you to their toys and to each other. They are good friends.
