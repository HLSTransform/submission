Once there was a harmless little mouse named Mike. Mike had decided he wanted to explore the world, so he left his home and set off into the wilderness. As he was travelling, he met a friendly dog who mentioned a mysterious tank deep in the forest. Mike was excited about the tank and couldn't wait to find out what was inside.
Mike eventually arrived at the tank and peered inside. There were many colourful fish swimming around, and he thought they were beautiful. He decided to take a closer look, and carefully climbed into the tank. He swam around with the fish and played with them, until it was time to go home.
Mike jumped out of the tank and waved goodbye to the fish. He thanked the friendly dog for mentioning the mysterious tank and he was very happy with his adventure. Mike looked forward to telling his family all about the harmless and wonderful fish he had seen.
