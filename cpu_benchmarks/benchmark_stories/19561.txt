Mia was looking out the window. She was wearing her favorite dress, and she loved to twirl around in it. In her hand was a special makeup stick, her mom had given it to her. She stood there and gazed out at the garden gate, it was so long and tall. 
Suddenly, Mia got an idea. She ran to get her box of colored markers, and quickly went back to the window. She began to draw on the glass - adding eyes, a mouth and bright colors! Mia had made a beautiful face - and it was looking back at her. 
Mia smiled and then went back to her makeup box. She quickly grabbed her purple lipstick and squeezed it onto her lips. Mia looked at her reflection in the window and admired the artwork she had made and the long beautiful dress that twirled around her. 
Mia giggled and admired her look. She was so happy with her design and the way it made her feel - beautiful and confident. Mia smiled and raced off to show all her friends.
