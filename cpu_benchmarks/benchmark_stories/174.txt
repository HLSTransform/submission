Once upon a time, there was a rabbit named Bob. Bob was very lazy and never wanted to do anything. One day, Bob's friend, a squirrel named Sally, came to visit him. Sally brought some vegetables to share with Bob.
Bob looked at the vegetables and said, "No, thank you. I don't want to eat vegetables. They're yucky."
Sally replied, "But vegetables are good for you. They make you strong and healthy."
Bob thought about it for a moment and decided to try some vegetables. He realized they were actually quite tasty! From that day on, Bob started eating vegetables and became stronger and healthier.
The moral of the story is that it's important to share and try new things, even if we don't think we'll like them at first.
