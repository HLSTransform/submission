Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside on his swing. He would swing back and forth, up and down, and it made him very happy. 
One day, Timmy's mom asked him to help serve dinner. Timmy knew this was an important job, so he happily agreed. He set the table with plates, forks, and cups. 
After dinner, Timmy went back outside to swing. He felt proud of himself for serving his family and doing an important job. As he swung higher and higher, he smiled and felt grateful for the fun and love in his life.
