Once upon a time, there was a big animal called a rhinoceros. He had a big horn on his nose and he loved to eat grass. One day, he was walking in the jungle when he felt the ground tremble. He was scared and didn't know what was happening.
Suddenly, he saw a group of small animals running towards him. They were very enthusiastic and happy to see him. They told him that there was going to be a big party in the jungle and they wanted him to come. The rhinoceros was very happy and decided to go with them.
At the party, the rhinoceros had a lot of fun. He danced and ate lots of food. He was very happy that he had made new friends. When it was time to go home, the rhinoceros said goodbye to his new friends and went back to his home in the jungle. From that day on, he was never scared of the ground trembling again.
