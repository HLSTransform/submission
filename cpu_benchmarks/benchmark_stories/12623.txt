Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to reach for the salt on the top shelf. But Lily was too short to reach it. She tried standing on her tippy toes, but she still couldn't reach it.
Lily's mommy said, "Oh no, we need the salt for our fancy dinner tonight. What are we going to do?" Lily thought for a moment and then said, "I have an idea! I can climb on the chair and reach it!" Her mommy was worried, but she helped Lily climb on the chair and she was able to reach the salt.
But then, as they were cooking, Lily accidentally spilled the salt all over the floor. Her mommy was upset and said, "Oh no, now we have a big mess to clean up!" Lily felt bad and said, "I'm sorry mommy. I'll help you clean it up." They worked together to clean up the salt and the kitchen was spotless again.
