Tim and Lily were twins who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big slide that looked very fun. Tim wanted to go on the slide, but Lily was scared. She said, "No, Tim, the slide is too high and too fast. I want to stay on the swings."
Tim said, "Don't be silly, Lily. The slide is not scary. It is fun. Come with me. I will hold your hand."
Lily shook her head. She said, "No, Tim, I don't want to. You go. I will remain on the swings."
Tim was angry. He said, "Fine, Lily. You are a baby. I will go on the slide by myself. You will miss the fun."
Tim ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. He looked down and saw how high and steep the slide was. He felt a little scared, but he did not want to show it. He said to himself, "I am brave. I can do this."
He pushed himself off the ladder and slid down the slide. He went very fast and felt the wind in his hair. He was having fun, until he saw a big rock at the end of the slide. He tried to stop, but he could not. He hit the rock with a loud thud and fell off the slide. He hurt his knee and his elbow and his head. He cried out loud.
Lily heard Tim's cry and looked up. She saw him lying on the ground, bleeding and crying. She felt sorry for him. She ran to him and hugged him. She said, "Tim, are you okay? I'm sorry you got hurt. I love you."
Tim hugged her back. He said, "Lily, I'm sorry I was mean to you. You were right. The slide was too high and too fast. I love you too."
They both learned a lesson that day. They learned to respect each other's will and feelings. They also learned to be careful and slow when they play. They went home with their mom and dad, who gave them hugs and kisses and band-aids. They were happy and safe.
