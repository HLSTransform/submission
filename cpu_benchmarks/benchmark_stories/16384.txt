One day, a little boy named Tom was very sad. He cried all day because he lost his toy. His mom saw him cry and wanted to help.
Mom gave Tom a lecture. She told him, "Do not cry. We will find your toy." Tom stopped crying and started to look for his toy with his mom.
They looked in the house and in the yard. Finally, they found the toy under a big tree. Tom was happy again and stopped being sad. He hugged his mom and they played together all day.
