Once upon a time, there was a musician. He had been playing music for a very long time, and loved it. He always had a smile on his face when he was playing.
One day, he made a mistake. He was so sad and wished he could take it back. He went to a friend to ask for help. His friend kindly told him to forgive himself. He was so glad to hear this!
The musician thanked his friend and followed his advice. He stopped feeling sad and started to feel better. Now, every time he plays, he is always glad!
