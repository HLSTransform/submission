Once upon a time there lived a little frog. One day, while wandering around, he saw an enormous palm tree off in the distance. He hopped towards it to take a closer look. 
When he got there, he noticed a big hole in the trunk of the tree. He decided to investigate. As the little frog hopped inside, he heard a strange noise coming from the depths of the tree.
He moved closer, and suddenly a huge parrot burst from the darkness. The parrot warned the frog to get out of the tree, as a monster lived deep inside and was not happy with visitors.
The little frog was scared at first, but then he realised what he had to do. He thanked the parrot for his warning and quickly hopped away from the enormous palm tree. The frog never went back to that tree again.
