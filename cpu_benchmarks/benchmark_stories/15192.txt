Once upon a time, there was a toy named Tim. Tim was a busy toy. He lived in a big toy box with many other toys. They all liked to play together.
One day, Tim thought he wanted to go on an adventure. He climbed out of the toy box and went to the garden. In the garden, he saw a big tree and a pretty flower. Tim was very happy.
Tim met a bug named Ben in the garden. They played together and had lots of fun. Ben showed Tim how to find food under the rocks. Tim thought it was the best day ever. When it was time to go home, Tim said goodbye to Ben and went back to the toy box. He could not wait to tell his toy friends about his adventure.
