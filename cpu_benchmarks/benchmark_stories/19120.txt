Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy's mom and dad had to go to work every day, so Timmy stayed with his grandma. One day, Timmy's grandma was troubled because she couldn't snap the buttons on her shirt. Timmy saw that his grandma was having trouble, so he decided to help her. 
Timmy went to his room and found a toy car that he had to snap together. He remembered how it worked and brought it to his grandma. He showed her how to snap the buttons on her shirt just like he snapped the toy car together. 
His grandma was so happy and proud of Timmy for helping her. From that day on, Timmy knew that he could help others when they were troubled.
