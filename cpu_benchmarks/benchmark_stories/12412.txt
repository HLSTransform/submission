Once there was a naughty boy who lived in a small town. He loved to play pranks on people and one day he decided to put a rock in the mailbox. He thought it would be funny, so he laughed and grinned.
The mailman saw the naughty boy and he knew what the boy was doing. He was very angry and he ran to get the town mayor. The mayor was angry too and he ordered the naughty boy to leave the town.
The naughty boy was very sad. He didn't want to go and he tried to explain it was only a joke, but the mayor wouldn't listen. He shrugged his shoulders and sadly said goodbye.
The naughty boy never saw his town again. He was never allowed back and no one would ever forgive him for what he did. He had a bad ending and he never learned his lesson.
