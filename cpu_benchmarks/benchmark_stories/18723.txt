Once upon a time, there was a big guard who looked after a castle. He was very tired from staying up all night. One day, a little mouse came to the castle and scared the guard. The guard was surprised and jumped up in the air. The mouse was very small and not scary at all, but the guard was still scared. The mouse went away and the guard felt better. From that day on, the guard made sure to get enough rest so that he wouldn't be scared by little mice anymore.
