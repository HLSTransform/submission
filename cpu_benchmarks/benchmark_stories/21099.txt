One day, a little girl named Lily went for a walk. She saw a tidy house with a pretty garden. In the garden, there was a twisty path. Lily walked on the path and found a cross at the end. She was very curious.
Lily heard a voice and turned around. "Hi, I am Tom," said a little boy. "Do you like my twisty path and cross?"
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, I like it a lot. Your house and garden are very tidy too."
Tom was happy to hear this. "Thank you! I work hard to keep it clean. Do you want to play with me?"
Lily nodded her head. They played together all day long. They became good friends and loved to explore the twisty path and the cross in the tidy garden.
