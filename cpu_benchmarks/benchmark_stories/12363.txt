"Mommy, why don't I have a velvet cushion like we saw in the shop yesterday?" asked Sally.
"It was too dangerous, Sally. If you had it, it might have ended up being ripped," replied Mommy.
"But why is it dangerous?", asked Sally.
Mommy explained, "It is dangerous because it is so soft and smooth and you could easily drop something on it and it might get damaged."
Sally answered, "Oh, I see. I understand now. I won't put anything dangerous on your velvet cushion."
Mommy was happy. She said, "That's a good idea, Sally. Now let's go home and play."
So, Sally and Mommy went home, happy to have avoided ending up with a damaged velvet cushion.
