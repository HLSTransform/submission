Once upon a time, there was a bright, light sun. It waved in the sky, sending warmth and light to everyone on Earth.
In a garden nearby, there was a little girl called Lucy. She waved to the sun and the sun waved back. Whenever she waved, a bright little sparkle of light would appear.
Lucy loved to play in the garden, and she especially loved to pick flowers. Every day before lunch, she would pick the brightest, lightest flower she could find. She would examine it to make sure it was perfect, and then she would wave it in the air and make a wish.
Lucy believed that as long as she waved her flower and made a wish, it would come true one day. She did not know what her wish was yet, but she was sure it had something to do with her future. She was sure that one day she would make her wish, and the sun's light would help make it happen.
