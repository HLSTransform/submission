Anna likes to crawl. She crawls under the table, under the sofa, under the bed. She pretends she is a mouse or a cat or a snake. She makes funny noises and giggles.
One day, she crawls under the window and sees a big aeroplane in the sky. It is white and shiny and has wings and a tail. It makes a loud noise and flies very fast. Anna is amazed and excited. She wants to see more aeroplanes.
She crawls out of the window and into the garden. She looks up and sees many aeroplanes. Some are big, some are small, some are red, some are blue. They fly in different directions and make different noises. Anna thinks they are busy. They must have many places to go and many things to do.
She crawls to the fence and waves at the aeroplanes. She hopes they see her and wave back. She says hello and goodbye and thank you and please. She thinks they are friendly and nice.
She crawls back to the window and sees her mum. Her mum smiles and picks her up. She hugs her and kisses her and says she loves her. She asks her what she was doing. Anna tells her she was crawling and watching the aeroplanes. She says they are busy and friendly and nice. Her mum says she is clever and curious and brave. She says they can watch the aeroplanes together. Anna is happy and proud. She loves her mum and the aeroplanes.
