Once upon a time there were two friends, Jack and Jill. Jack had a small shirt that he really liked. One day, as they were playing in the park, Jill asked Jack to give her the shirt. 
Jack said, "No, I like this shirt."
But Jill kept insisting that she wanted it, until Jack said: "Alright, okay, I'll give it to you." 
Jill was very excited and quickly spoke, "Give it to me now!" She started to hold out her hand. 
But Jack just smiled, and he said, "No, not now. When I need it back." 
At first, Jill was confused and asked what Jack meant. Jack then said, "You will see. Hold on to it and when I need it, I'll let you know." 
Jill was slightly annoyed but she reluctantly agreed and took the small shirt from Jack. She carefully folded it, even though it was so small. 
A few days later, Jack was heading to a very special occasion and he remembered his shirt. He asked Jill to bring it to him and when she did, they both laughed. Jill's eyes lit up with understanding. Jack had planned ahead and given her his shirt so she could look fancy at the event!
