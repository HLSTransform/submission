Jill and Tom were friends. They liked to play with toys and draw pictures. One day, Jill saw a cute thing in the store. It was a fluffy bunny with big ears and a pink nose. Jill wanted the cute thing very much.
"Can I have the cute thing, Mom?" Jill asked.
"No, Jill. You have many toys at home. You don't need the cute thing," Mom said.
Jill was sad. She looked at the cute thing and wished it was hers. She did not listen to Mom. She took the cute thing and hid it in her bag. She thought Mom would not see.
When they got home, Jill ran to her room. She took out the cute thing and hugged it. She felt happy. But then she heard Mom call her name.
"Jill, come here. I need to talk to you," Mom said.
Jill felt scared. She knew Mom was angry. She put the cute thing under her bed and went to Mom.
"Jill, what is this?" Mom asked. She showed Jill the tag from the cute thing. It said how much it cost.
Jill looked at the tag. She felt bad. She knew she did a wrong thing. She took the cute thing without paying.
"I'm sorry, Mom. I wanted the cute thing so much. I took it from the store," Jill said.
Mom was very upset. She said Jill had to go back to the store and say sorry. She said Jill had to give back the cute thing. She said Jill had to learn to be honest and not steal.
Jill cried. She did not want to give back the cute thing. She loved the cute thing. But she knew she had to do what Mom said. She regretted taking the cute thing. She wished she had listened to Mom. She learned a hard lesson.
