Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a big skeleton. The skeleton was very icy and cold. He liked to turn around and dance all day. All the kids in the town were scared of him because he was so big and icy.
One day, a little girl named Lily went up to the skeleton and said, "Hi, Mr. Skeleton! Why are you so icy and cold?" The skeleton looked at her and said, "I don't know, little girl. I have always been like this."
Lily thought for a moment and said, "Do you want to be warm and happy like me?" The skeleton nodded his head. So, Lily held the skeleton's hand and they danced together. As they danced, the skeleton started to feel warm and happy. He was not icy anymore. The other kids saw this and they all joined in the dance.
From that day on, the big skeleton was not icy and cold anymore. He was warm and happy because he had friends to dance with. The kids in the town were not scared of him anymore. They all learned that even someone who looks scary can be a good friend if you give them a chance.
