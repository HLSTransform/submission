Once upon a time, there was a boy named Mark. He had a big garden with lots of different flowers and big green bushes. But something was missing. He wanted a hose to water the garden. 
One day, Mark's mom got him a hose. It was a long and curvy hose with lots of different colors. Mark was so happy!
Mark hooked up the hose to the faucet in the front of his garden and started watering the plants. As he watered them, he noticed something strange. The water tasted really bitter. Mark tried to ignore it, but the water kept tasting worse and worse. 
Mark felt really sad. He thought his new hose was broken! He asked his mom what to do. "Maybe there's something in the hose," she said. 
After a few minutes, she found the problem. It was a little frog peeking out of the hose! She quickly pulled it out and the water tasted much better.
Mark smiled with joy. He was so glad his hose wasn't broken after all!  From then on, he called his hose his "lucky hose" and took care of it in his garden.
