Once upon a time, there was a helpless girl. She was walking in a meadow and she saw a big envelope. She was surprised, and went close to have a look. Suddenly, a big wind came and scattered the envelope all around. The helpless girl was very sad and felt like she had lost something very important.
But then, a big bird came flying from the sky and started picking up the pieces from the envelope. He put them back together, carefully, and dropped it off in the same place. The helpless girl was very happy and could not believe it. She hugged the envelope tightly and thanked the bird for his help.
Soon enough, the girl opened the envelope and found a great surprise. Inside, there was a toy for her to play with. Her eyes lit up and she was happier than ever! From that day onwards, the little helpless girl and the big bird were best friends.
