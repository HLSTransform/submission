Once there was a blue zoomer. It zoomed around all day long! Everywhere it went, people smiled and laughed. 
One day it zoomed to a park where a little boy was playing. The zoomer circled the boy and made him laugh! When the boy opened his mouth, the zoomer saw that he was missing a tooth! 
So the zoomer zoomed to the tooth fairy. The tooth fairy was very surprised to see the fly. She asked why it had come.
The zoomer told the tooth fairy about the little boy and his missing tooth. The tooth fairy smiled and said she would help. 
The next day the little boy awoke to find a shiny new tooth in place of the old one! He opened his mouth in amazement and saw the tooth was even shinier than before. 
The little boy knew it was the zoomer who made it happen and smiled with gratitude. He thanked the zoomer for its help and then they zoomed away together, smiling and laughing.
