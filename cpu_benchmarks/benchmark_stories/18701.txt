Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she found a plastic ball in the grass. It was dirty, but Lily didn't mind. She played with it anyway.
After a while, Lily got tired and wanted to rest. She looked around and saw a bench. She went over to it and sat down. The bench was also dirty, but Lily didn't care. She was happy to rest and watch the other kids play.
As she sat on the bench, Lily noticed that the ball she was playing with had a hole in it. It wasn't good anymore. She decided to throw it away in the trash can. Then she went back to playing with her friends. The end.
