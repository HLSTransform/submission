Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the springtime. One day, she found a wallet on the ground. She picked it up and looked inside. There was a lot of money in it!
Lily was excited at first, but then she felt frustrated. She didn't know what to do with the wallet. She decided to ask her mom for help.
"Mommy, I found a wallet outside. What should I do with it?" Lily asked.
Her mom replied, "You should bring it to the police station. They can help find the owner."
Lily was happy to have found a solution. She ran to the police station with the wallet and gave it to a police officer. The officer thanked her and said that she did the right thing.
Lily felt proud of herself for doing the right thing and helping someone else. She continued to play outside in the beautiful spring weather.
