The rabbit and the chipmunk were friends. One day, the chipmunk showed the rabbit his special track that he had been working on for days. The rabbit was very envious. The chipmunk had worked so hard and the rabbit wanted to be like him.
The next day, the rabbit took the chipmunk's track without asking. He put it in his home and thought he was the best for having it.
But the chipmunk found out. He was sad and angry that the rabbit had taken his track without asking. He showed the rabbit what he thought of him by not saying a word and walking away.
The rabbit didn't understand why the chipmunk was so sad and angry. He thought the chipmunk should be happy that he wanted his track. But the chipmunk didn't share the same feeling.
The rabbit and the chipmunk were no longer friends after that day. The rabbit was sad but also a bit envious of how the chipmunk was able to stand up for himself.
