Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She loved to chew! She would chew all day and all night!
One day, the girl was sitting at her white table when she saw a very interesting looking thing. It was round and colourful, and it was trying to escape. It was a piece of chewing gum!
The little girl was so excited that she immediately started to chew. She chewed and chewed and chewed, until eventually the gum was all gone.
The girl was very happy. She picked up the white table and danced around the room with it. The girl was so pleased that she could chew. She made sure that her table was nice and clean after her chewing session.
The end.
