Once upon a time, there was a little pig. He was happy living on his farm. One day it was very windy. The wind was blowing dirt all over the farm. The pig didn't like it because it was dirty.
The pig was trying to sleep, but the wind was disturbing him. He was trying to sleep but the wind kept blowing the dirt in his face. He was very tired, so he decided to go inside the house.
The pig saw that the house was very safe and quiet. He settled into his house and went to sleep. He was relieved because the wind was no longer disturbing him. The pig slept peacefully, nice and warm in his house.
