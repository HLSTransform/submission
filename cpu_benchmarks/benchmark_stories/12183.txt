Once upon a time, a little girl called Lucy was feeling very sleepy. She looked up at her mommy and said,"Mommy, I want to find some new clothes." Her mommy smiled and said, "OK, let's get dressed."
So, mommy and Lucy put on their warm coats and went out. They look around the shops, but couldn't find what Lucy wanted.
Suddenly, mommy said, "Oh look! There is something special in that shop." Lucy rushed over and saw a pretty dress with sparkly bits on the front. She was so excited she wanted to put it on right away.
Mommy bought the dress and they went home. Lucy was so excited she ran into her bedroom and put the dress on. She looked in the mirror, smiled and said, "Mommy I look beautiful!"
This made mommy happy and she gave Lucy a big hug. Lucy was so happy she forgot how sleepy she was. 
The end.
