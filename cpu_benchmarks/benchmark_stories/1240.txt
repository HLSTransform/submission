Once, there was a little girl. She was very sad, because she didn't have a wagon. She had asked her mom and dad for one, but they couldn't afford to get her one.
Every day she would look out her window, hoping to see a wagon appear. She looked for a long time, but a wagon never seemed to show up.
One day, something very exciting happened. When the little girl looked out her window, she suddenly saw a wagon appear! She was very happy and ran to tell her mom and dad.
They looked out the window, and saw that it was a very old wagon. But it was just what the little girl needed!
The little girl's mom and dad fixed up the wagon, and the little girl was so happy to have it! She ran outside and started playing with it right away.
All her sadness quickly disappeared as she played with her new wagon.
