Once upon a time there was a girl called Mary. Mary wanted to write something very special. She had a contest and everybody was invited to write. Mary said, “Whoever writes the prettiest story wins!”
She was very excited but also a little scared. It was a dangerous contest. Would she win?
Mary worked very hard, writing the story all day. All the other children did too, some of them wrote stories even better than hers.
But then, one boy wrote the most beautiful story anybody had ever seen. Everyone shouted, “He wins!”
Mary was sad, but then the boy came up to her and said, “You tried hard and I like your story.”
Mary smiled. She was happy that the boy had tried his best – even if he didn’t win.
