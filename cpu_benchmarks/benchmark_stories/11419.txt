Tony was walking home. He was so excited because it was Christmas Eve! Suddenly, Tony saw something in the corner of his eye. He stopped and looked. Wow! A big red wrap with a bow! Tony ran over and picked it up. Inside was something that looked like a toy. It was moving fast! 
Tony looked at the person next to him and said, "What is this?" The person smiled and said, "It's a toy race car. You can take it for a drive!"
Tony looked so happy. He ran home and couldn't wait to show his parents. They all looked at the race car, and Tony said he wanted to take it for a drive.
His dad smiled and said, "I think that's a great idea. Let's take it for a spin!" Tony got behind the wheel and started to drive. He looked so happy and excited as he went faster and faster down the street.
When they came back home, Tony was so happy that it was Christmas! He had the best present ever.
