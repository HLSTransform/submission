Once there was a kangaroo who was very nice. He liked to share with his friends. One day the kangaroo found a box of treats. He thought they smelled so good, so he wanted to share them with his friends. He hopped around to find them. But there were no friends to be found.
The kangaroo was sad, so he went to sit under a shady tree. There was a mild breeze and it cooled him from the warm sun. He had a sudden thought! The kangaroo hopped back to the treats and broke some of the treats in half.
He soon found his friends and shared the treats with them. Everyone was so happy! They enjoyed the treats and thanked the kangaroo for sharing with them. Ever since then, the kangaroo has been spreading the joy of sharing wherever he goes.
