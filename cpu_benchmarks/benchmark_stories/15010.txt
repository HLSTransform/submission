Once upon a time there was a clumsy bear. His name was Mr. Bear. One day, he wanted to explore a cave. He asked his friends if they wanted to go with him.
His best friend, Mrs. Fox, said, "Yes! Let's go!"
So they both went to the cave together. When they arrived, they saw that it was filled with rocks. Mr. Bear said to Mrs. Fox, "Let's rock this cave!" So they both got down on their hands and knees and started moving the rocks around the cave.
As they were moving the rocks, Mr. Bear noticed something shiny in the corner of the cave. He picked it up, and it was a big, shiny diamond! He shouted out to Mrs. Fox, "Look what I found!" 
Mrs. Fox was so excited!
They decided to keep the diamond as a reward for their hard work. From that day on, Mr. Bear was no longer clumsy. He was very brave, and he loved exploring caves.
