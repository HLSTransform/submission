Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together. One day, they find a big box in the garage. Inside the box, there are many things. There are hats, scarves, shoes, and a microphone.
"Wow, look at this!" Ben says. He picks up the microphone. It is black and shiny. He presses a button and makes a loud noise. "Hello, hello, hello!"
Anna laughs. She sees a furry hat. It is pink and fluffy. She puts it on her head. She feels warm and cozy. "I like this hat!" she says. She picks up a scarf. It is blue and long. She wraps it around her neck.
"Let's play a game!" Ben says. He has an idea. "We can pretend we are singers. We can sing songs and dance. Do you want to play?"
"Yes, yes, yes!" Anna says. She likes to sing and dance. She nods her head.
"OK, then. Let's gather some more things. We can make a stage. We can use the box and some blankets. We can invite Mom and Dad to watch us. It will be fun!" Ben says.
Anna and Ben gather some more things. They make a stage. They put on some shoes. They hold the microphone. They are ready to sing and dance. They are happy. They are singers.
