Anna and Ben like to play in the garden. They see a big brown vine on the wall. It has many green leaves and red flowers.
"Look, Ben, how many flowers are on the vine?" Anna asks.
"Let's count them!" Ben says. He points to each flower and says a number. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!"
"Wow, that's a lot of flowers!" Anna says. She claps her hands. "Can we pick some?"
"No, Anna, we can't pick the flowers. They are not ours. They belong to the vine. The vine needs them to grow and be happy." Ben says.
"Oh, I see. Then let's just look at them and smell them. They are very pretty and sweet." Anna says. She leans closer to the vine and breathes in the fragrance.
"Yes, they are. Maybe we can draw them later. Do you have crayons?" Ben asks.
"I do! I have red, green, and brown crayons. We can make a picture of the vine and the flowers." Anna says.
"Great! Let's go get them and find some paper. Then we can show our picture to Mom and Dad." Ben says.
They run to the house, holding hands. They are happy to have found the vine and to have counted the flowers. They love to play and learn together.
