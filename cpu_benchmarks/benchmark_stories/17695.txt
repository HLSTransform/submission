Maria and Mark went to the doctors together. Mark had hurt his arm and it was very sore. Maria looked at Mark and noticed he was very sad. The doctor looked at Mark's arm and said that he should get an x-ray. Maria was a little jealous that Mark was getting an x-ray, but she was happy too.
The X-ray showed that Mark's arm was broken. The doctor said she had to fix it right away. she put a plaster on it to help it heal. When it was all done, Mark's arm felt better. He was very happy and he gave Maria a big hug. He thanked her for being with him and not being jealous. She was very glad that he was OK.
