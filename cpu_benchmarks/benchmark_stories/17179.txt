Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man who loved his garden. He had many plants in his garden, but his favorite was a small, green plant that he had grown from a seed. Every day, he watered the plant and watched it grow bigger and stronger.
One day, the man noticed that the plant had a small, yellow flower on it. He knew that this was a sign that something special was going to happen. He waited and waited, and finally, the flower opened up to reveal a shiny, red fruit.
The man was so happy and excited! He picked the fruit and took it inside to show his family. They were all amazed by the beautiful fruit that the plant had grown. From that day on, the man knew that his little plant was truly special, and he continued to take care of it with love and care.
