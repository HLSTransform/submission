Once upon a time, there were two little boys called Sim and Tim. Sim and Tim loved to play and have fun outdoors. One day they were playing in the park when they saw a bottle of wine on the ground.
Sim said: "let's start to drink it!" 
But Tim said: "No, no Sim! That's not for us!"
Sim replied: "Why not? It's so warm and it looks so nice!"
But Tim stayed firm and said: "No, Sim! We shouldn't drink it. It's not for us, it can make us sick!"
Despite Tim's warning, Sim started drinking the wine. He felt an immediate warmth and he liked it. But then he started coughing and feeling very bad.
The next day, Tim went to visit Sim and was very sad when he saw Sim in bed, coughing and feeling sick.
The moral of the story is: when you are young and curious, it is always best to listen to your elders and do as they say. Don't get tempted by things which can harm or hurt you.
