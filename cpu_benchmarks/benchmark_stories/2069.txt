Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She liked to wear pretty dresses and shiny shoes. One day, she went to school and her teacher read a poem. Lily liked the poem very much and she clapped her hands.
After school, Lily went to play with her friends. They played tag and hide-and-seek. But then, Lily fell down and hurt her knee. She cried and her friends helped her up. They took her to the teacher who put a bandage on her knee. Lily felt better and thanked her friends for helping her.
That night, Lily's mom read her a bedtime story. Lily fell asleep and dreamt about wearing a beautiful dress and reciting a poem in front of her friends. She felt happy and her knee didn't hurt anymore. The end.
