Lily was excited to go to the party. She put on her pink dress and her shiny shoes. She wanted to look pretty. She ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.
"Wow, you look so nice!" said Mommy, who followed her. "Do you want me to help you with your hair?"
"Yes, please!" said Lily. She sat on a small stool and Mommy brushed her hair. She made two braids and tied them with ribbons. Lily smiled in the mirror. She liked her braids.
"Thank you, Mommy!" she said. "Can we go now?"
"Sure, honey. Let's go." Mommy took her hand and they walked to the car. Lily was excited to see her friends and have fun at the party. She hoped there would be cake and balloons. She loved parties.
