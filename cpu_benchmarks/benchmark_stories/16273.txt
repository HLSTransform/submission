Once upon a time there was a fairy named Fara. Fara had a very special power: she could cast spells.
One day Fara was feeling sleepy and started flying around. She didn't know where she was going, but she wanted to explore the world.
She flew until she spotted a small cottage. Inside she found a little girl called Luce. Luce was very brave and decided to dare Fara to cast a spell.
Fara accepted the challenge and tried to think of a spell. Finally, she had an idea: Fara said words very gently, until Luce felt very sleepy.
Then Fara flew away, leaving Luce nice and comfy in her bed. When Luce woke up she remembered the spell Fara had cast and she smiled.
