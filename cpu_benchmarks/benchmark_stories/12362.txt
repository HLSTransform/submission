Today, Ella went to the mechanic's shop. The mechanic was chubby. When the mechanic saw Ella, he smiled and said, "Hi there!" and Ella smiled back. 
The mechanic asked Ella, "What can I do for you today?" Ella looked around the shop and stared at a big red toolbox. She asked the mechanic, "What's inside?" The mechanic opened the toolbox and showed her a lot of tools. Ella was so amazed and she kept staring. 
The mechanic laughed and said, "We can make anything with these tools." Ella looked around with big eyes and said, "Wow!" The mechanic and Ella chatted for a while and then Ella waved goodbye. The mechanic smiled and waved back. 
On the way home Ella thought about the mechanic and smiled. She was so glad she went to the mechanic's shop.
