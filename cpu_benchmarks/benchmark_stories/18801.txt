Lily was a good girl who liked to behave. She always listened to her mom and dad, and did what they said. She helped with chores, played nicely with her toys, and said please and thank you.
But sometimes, Lily was afraid of the dark. She did not like to sleep in her room alone, because she thought there were monsters in the closet. She would hear noises and see shadows, and feel very scared. She would cry and call for her mom and dad, and they would come and hug her and tell her there was nothing to worry about.
One night, Lily had a bad dream. She dreamed that a big, hairy monster came out of the closet and grabbed her. She woke up screaming and ran to her mom and dad's room. They were sleeping, but they heard her and turned on the light. They saw Lily's pale face and wet eyes, and they knew she was very upset. They let her climb into their bed and cuddled her. They told her it was just a dream, and that there were no monsters in the closet. They sang her a lullaby and kissed her goodnight.
Lily felt better and calmed down. She realized that her mom and dad were right, and that there were no monsters in the closet. She thanked them for being so kind and loving, and told them she loved them too. She closed her eyes and fell asleep, feeling safe and happy. She was a good girl who liked to behave.
