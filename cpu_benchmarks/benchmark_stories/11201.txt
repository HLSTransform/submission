Once upon a time there was a chubby little bear. Every morning he would wander around his house trying to find something to do. One day he noticed something strange-- his mom had a big bag and was walking around packing things into it.
So he asked her, "What are you doing?" His mom smiled and said, "I'm packing for a special way away. You'll see."
The chubby bear was very excited about it. All day he ran around asking his mom if he could help pack. But she just said, "Not yet. Soon."
The little bear couldn't wait to see where this special way away was. That night he dreamed of tall mountains, and beaches with waves crashing in.
The next morning, his mom finished packing. She looked at the chubby little bear and said, "We're finally ready. It's time to go on our way away. We're going on a camping trip!"
