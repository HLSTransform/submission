Once upon a time, there was a nosy little boy named Joe. Joe wanted to explore the reef and he was determined. Joe asked his mum if he could do this and she agreed.
Joe hopped into his boat, with a curious look on his face and a big smile. He waved at his mum just before the boat started to drift away.
Joe sailed as far as he could, taking in the sights of the reef and all the amazing things he saw. He noticed some little fish swimming around him, and he even spotted a crab scuttling along.
When Joe’s boat reached the reef, he was a bit scared. He saw some huge corals and he could hear the waves crashing against them. He took a deep breath and slowly he began to rub his hand against one of the corals. He felt something slimy and he quickly pulled his hand away! 
Joe was so curious. He wanted to know what was on the coral so he started to rub it gently. After a few minutes, he shouted “Mum! Look what I found!” He was so excited and showed his mum a shiny little starfish he had discovered. 
Joe was delighted and his mum was proud of him for being so nosy. From then on, Joe went searching for more hidden treasures at the reef.
