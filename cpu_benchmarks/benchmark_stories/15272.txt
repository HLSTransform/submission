Lacey was a very eager girl. Every day she would get a folder from her mom and look inside. It had all sorts of exciting things inside. 
Sometimes it had pictures that she could draw. Other times it had stories that she could read. Lacey liked to look inside her folder to see what new funny things were inside. 
When she was done reading, drawing or playing with the things inside her folder, she would put them back in and show her mom. Her mom would give her a big smile and they would talk about how much Lacey had improved. 
This made Lacey very happy. She liked to improve and to show her mom. So every day she would get her folder and eagerly open it to see what new things she had!
