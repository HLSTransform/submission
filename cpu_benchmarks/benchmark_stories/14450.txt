The pupil was grumpy. He didn't want to do his work. He wanted to relax and have fun. His teacher was very understanding and told him to take a break and close his eyes for a few moments.
So the pupil closed his eyes and relaxed. He took a deep breath and his body felt much better. The grumpy feeling went away and he had a warm feeling inside.
He then opened his eyes and the pupil was happy. He had been able to take a break, relax and get rid of his grumpy feelings. He was ready to continue his work.
The teacher smiled and said, "I'm glad that you were able to relax. Now let's get back to work!" The pupil smiled and got back to work. He was no longer grumpy and he was able to focus better.
