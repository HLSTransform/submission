Once upon a time, there was a little boy. His name was Bobby. He was very adventurous. He loved exploring the world around him.
One day, Bobby went outside to play. He saw lots of things that he wanted to zoom around. He was so excited! But soon he got too tired and stopped to rest.
As he was resting, Bobby started to weep. He was sad because he couldn't zoom around as much as he wanted to. He felt so lonely.
But then, a magical fairy appeared! With a wave of her wand, she gave Bobby wings! Now he could zoom around and be as adventurous as he wanted to be.
Bobby was so happy! He flew and zoomed around, enjoying his new wings. He no longer had to weep. He was free and happy.
