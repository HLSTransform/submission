Timmy decided to take the trophy home and show it to his mom. On the way home, he realized that he had lost his way. He was scared and didn't know what to do. 
Timmy tried to find his way back, but he couldn't. He started to feel hungry and tired. Suddenly, he saw a bear coming towards him. Timmy tried to run, but he wasn't fast enough. The bear caught him and Timmy was no longer safe.
