Anna and Ben like to play with cardboard. They have many boxes and tubes and cut them and stick them. They make houses and cars and rockets and animals. They have fun.
One day, Anna finds a big cardboard box in the garage. She thinks it is perfect for a castle. She asks Ben to help her. Ben says yes. They drag the box to the backyard. They start to cut and stick.
Anna wants to make the castle pink. She likes pink. She finds some pink paint and a brush. She starts to paint the box. Ben does not like pink. He likes blue. He finds some blue paint and a brush. He starts to paint the box too.
Anna and Ben start to fight. They say mean words. They splash paint on each other. They rip the box. They cry. The castle is ruined. The paint is everywhere. They are dirty and sad.
Mom and Dad come home. They see the mess. They are angry. They scold Anna and Ben. They tell them to clean up. They take away the paint and the cardboard. They send them to their rooms. Anna and Ben have no castle. They have no fun. They have a bad day.
