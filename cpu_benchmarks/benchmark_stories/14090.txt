Once upon a time, there was a big tree in the forest. Inside the tree was a trunk. In the trunk was something unknown. The trunk was magic and one day it began to freeze! Suddenly, the trunk began to move around the forest. It was so cold that all the animals in the forest began to shiver and shake.
The trunk moved very fast and it went up and down the hills of the forest. It left a trail of coldness behind it. Everyone in the forest tried to keep warm and they looked for the mysterious trunk.
Then one day, a brave little boy decided to approach the trunk. He was not afraid. As he got closer, the trunk opened and out came a huge snowman! The snowman was happy to be free and it danced around the forest.
The snowman waved goodbye to the little boy and walked away. Soon the unknown trunk was no longer unknown and it was gone forever. As the little boy watched it go, he smiled. It was a magical experience that he would never forget.
