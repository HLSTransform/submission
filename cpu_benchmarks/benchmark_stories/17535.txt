Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big bird with many feathers. Anna wanted to touch the feathers. She ran after the bird.
"Anna, stop!" Ben said. "The bird does not like that. It will fly away."
But Anna did not listen. She was persistent. She insisted on touching the feathers. She got closer and closer to the bird.
The bird saw Anna. It was scared. It flapped its wings and made a loud noise. It flew up in the air. But one feather fell down. Anna saw the feather. She was happy. She picked up the feather.
"Look, Ben!" Anna said. "I got a feather!"
Ben was not happy. He was worried. He saw something else. He saw a big dog. The dog saw the feather. The dog liked the feather. The dog ran after Anna.
"Anna, watch out!" Ben said. "The dog wants your feather. It will bite you."
But Anna did not hear Ben. She was proud. She held the feather high. She did not see the dog. The dog got closer and closer to Anna.
What do you think will happen next?
