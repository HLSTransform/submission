Once upon a time, there was a helpful dog named Spot. He loved to spin around and play with his friends. One day, Spot found a big wreck in his yard. It was a broken toy car.
Spot saw his friend, Tim, standing near the wreck. Tim was sad. "What happened?" asked Spot. "My toy car is broken," said Tim, as he looked at the wreck. "I can't play with it anymore."
Spot wanted to help Tim. He had an idea. "Let's spin the wheels and see if it works!" said Spot. They spun the wheels together and, to their surprise, the toy car started to move. Tim was so happy. They played with the toy car all day long. And from that day on, Spot and Tim were the best of friends.
