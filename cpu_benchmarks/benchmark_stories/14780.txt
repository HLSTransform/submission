Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they go to the store with Lily's mom. The store has many toys. Lily and Tom see a big box. The box has a picture of a cell. A cell is a thing that makes a phone work.
"Look, Tom, a cell!" Lily says. "I want to see it."
"Me too," Tom says. They open the box. Inside, there is a cell. It is shiny and has many buttons. Lily and Tom want to touch it.
"Can we play with it, mom?" Lily asks.
"No, Lily, that is not a toy. That is a cell. It is for grown-ups. It is very expensive. Put it back in the box," Lily's mom says.
But Lily and Tom do not listen. They take the cell out of the box. They press the buttons. They make noises. They think it is great.
"Beep, beep, beep!" Lily says.
"Hello, hello, hello!" Tom says.
They laugh. They have fun. They do not see the man who works at the store. The man is angry. He sees Lily and Tom with the cell. He walks to them.
"Hey, you two, what are you doing? That is not a toy. That is a cell. Give it to me. Now!" the man says.
Lily and Tom are scared. They drop the cell. The cell falls on the floor. It breaks. It makes a loud sound. Lily and Tom cry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" Lily says.
"Me too, me too, me too!" Tom says.
Lily's mom runs to them. She sees the cell. She sees the man. She sees Lily and Tom. She is sad. She is mad.
"Lily, Tom, what have you done? That was a very bad thing to do. You did not listen to me. You did not listen to the man. You broke the cell. You have to say sorry to the man. You have to pay for the cell. You have to learn to be good," Lily's mom says.
Lily and Tom say sorry to the man. They say sorry to Lily's mom. They have no money to pay for the cell. Lily's mom has to pay for the cell. She has to pay a lot of money. She has no money for toys. Lily and Tom have no toys. They are sad. They are sorry. They wish they had listened. They wish they had not played with the cell. They wish they had been good.
