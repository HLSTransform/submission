Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a friendly dog named Max. They loved to play together in the park. One day, Lily wanted to stack some blocks. Max saw what she was doing and wanted to help. "Can I help you stack the blocks?" Max asked. "Yes, please!" Lily replied. Max used his nose to attach the blocks together. Lily was so happy that Max helped her. They played together all day long.
