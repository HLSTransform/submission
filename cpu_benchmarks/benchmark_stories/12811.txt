Once upon a time, there were two people. One was big and one was small. The small person wanted to play with the big person, but the big person disagreed.
The small person was so sad and frustrated. They didn't know what to do. Luckily, they had an idea.
The small person hugged the big person. At first, the big person still disagreed, but they felt the hug and started to smile. They hugged the small person back.
The small person was so happy! From that day on, the big person and the small person were best friends, and they never disagreed again.
