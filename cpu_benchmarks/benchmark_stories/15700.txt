Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucy. She was so adorable, with her bright eyes and rosy cheeks. 
One day Lucy's mummy said, "Time to learn something new, Lucy!" Lucy was very excited so she jumped up and down. 
Mummy took Lucy to the park and showed her some pretty flowers. "Look at the petals," said Mummy. 
Lucy tried to count them and said, "One, two, three!"
Mummy smiled and said, "That's right, Lucy! You're doing great!" 
Lucy felt proud of herself and wanted to learn more. So they explored the park. Everywhere they looked there were animals and plants. 
After a while Lucy got very tired. Mummy found a quiet corner, and said, "It's time for a rest."
So Lucy and Mummy sat in the quiet corner and watched the wind rustle through the trees. Lucy felt so calm, and it was nice to learn new things in a quiet, peaceful way. 
When the sun started to set, it was time to go home. Lucy was so proud of all that she had learned that day. 
"You did so well, Lucy," said Mummy, giving her a big hug.
And so together they went home, and Lucy was happy.
