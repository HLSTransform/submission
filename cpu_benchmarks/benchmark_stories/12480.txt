Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with blocks and dolls. But today they have a quarrel. Tom wants to build an enormous tower with all the blocks. Mia wants to make a house for her dolls with some of the blocks.
"Give me the blocks!" Tom says. He pulls the blocks from Mia's hands.
"No, they are mine!" Mia says. She pushes Tom away.
They shout and cry. They are not friends anymore.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees the blocks and the dolls on the floor. She sees Tom and Mia with angry faces.
"Why are you quarreling?" Mom asks. "You have many blocks and dolls. You can share and play together."
"But I want to build an enormous tower!" Tom says.
"And I want to make a house for my dolls!" Mia says.
Mom smiles. She has an idea. She picks up some blocks and dolls. She shows them to Tom and Mia.
"Look, you can both have what you want. You can build an enormous tower with these blocks. And you can make a house for your dolls with these blocks. And you can use these dolls to live in the tower and the house. How does that sound?"
Tom and Mia look at Mom. They look at the blocks and dolls. They think for a moment. Then they nod.
"Okay, that sounds good," Tom says.
"Yes, that sounds fun," Mia says.
They stop quarreling. They take the blocks and dolls. They start to build and play. They are friends again.
Mom is happy. She hugs them and says, "I'm glad you are friends again. Sharing is caring. And playing is fun. But remember, don't quarrel over toys. There are enough for everyone."
Tom and Mia hug Mom and say, "We're sorry, Mom. We won't quarrel again. We love you."
Mom says, "I love you too. Now have fun and be nice to each other."
Tom and Mia smile. They have fun and are nice to each other. They enjoy their enormous tower and their house for their dolls. They have a good day.
