Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He liked to play with his toys and run around in the park. One day, Timmy saw a big barrel in the park. It was scary looking and he didn't want to go near it.
Timmy's friend Billy came over and asked him why he was scared. Timmy told Billy about the scary barrel. Billy said, "Let's see if we can fit inside the barrel!" Timmy was hesitant at first, but he trusted Billy and they both tried to fit inside the barrel. It was a tight squeeze, but they managed to fit!
They started to giggle and laugh inside the barrel. It wasn't scary anymore! They played inside the barrel for a while until it was time to go home. Timmy realized that sometimes things can be scary at first, but if you try them out, they can be really fun!
