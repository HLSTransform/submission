One day, Jack and Jane were in their backyard having a great time playing together. Jack called out to Jane, "Let's go explore the forest!" Jane agreed and the two ran off together. 
They went deep into the forest, discovering new things and having a wonderful time. Soon, they stumbled across a small pond where they spotted a beautiful swan. The swan swam around the pond in the most playful way. 
Jack and Jane watched in awe. Jack then called out to the swan, "Hello Swan! Can we be your friends?" 
The swan replied, "Sure! My name is Grace and I make this pond my home. I love swimming, playing and exploring. Life is about having fun. It should be spent being playful and enjoying the world around you!"
Jack and Jane learnt that playing and exploring were important aspects of life. From then on, they immersed themselves in playful activities and explored their surroundings more often.
