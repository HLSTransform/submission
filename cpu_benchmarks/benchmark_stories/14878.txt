Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to go on picnics with her family. One day, her mom said they were going on a picnic to the park. Lily was so happy that she jumped up and down.
When they got to the park, Lily saw her friend, Timmy. He looked anxious and sad. Lily asked him what was wrong. Timmy said he lost his toy truck and couldn't find it. Lily frowned and felt sad for Timmy.
Lily's mom suggested they all look for the toy truck together. They searched and searched until finally, they found it! Timmy was so happy and thanked Lily and her family for helping him. They all sat down and enjoyed their picnic together. It was a beautiful day and everyone was happy.
