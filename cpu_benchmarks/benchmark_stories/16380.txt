Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to eat toast in the morning. One day, she woke up late and her mom had already left for work. Lily was sad because she missed her mom.
Lily went to the kitchen to make toast. She put the bread in the toaster and waited. When the toast popped up, she was so excited! But, she forgot to put butter on it. The toast became cold and hard.
Lily was sad because her toast was cold. Just then, her mom came back home. She had forgotten her keys! Lily's mom saw the cold toast and helped Lily make warm, yummy toast. Lily was happy and didn't miss her mom anymore. They ate toast together and had a great day.
