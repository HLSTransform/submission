Once upon a time there was a very intelligent little girl called Jo. Jo loved to explore and each day she would go on a new adventure.
One day, she decided to go to the park. While wandering around, she noticed something shiny on the ground. When she looked closer, she saw it was a picture! She was so excited, so she picked it up and took a closer look.
The picture was of two birds sitting in a tree. Jo was so happy and thought it was just the most beautiful picture ever. She decided to take it home and show it to her mom.
When Jo arrived back home, her mom was so surprised and so proud of her for finding such a wonderful picture. Jo was so pleased that she had found such an intelligent picture and she knew that it would make a great decoration for their home.
Jo hung the picture on the wall and smiled every time she saw it. She was now even more eager to explore the world and find more amazing pictures!
