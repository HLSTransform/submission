Lila and Tom were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to dig and water and watch the plants grow. One day, they saw a big red radish poking out of the ground. They both wanted to pick it and eat it.
"I saw it first!" said Lila.
"No, I did!" said Tom.
They pulled on the radish from both sides, but it did not come out. They pulled harder and harder, but it only got stuck deeper. They started to get angry and yell at each other.
"Let go of my radish!" said Lila.
"It's not yours, it's mine!" said Tom.
They did not notice that a rabbit was watching them from behind a bush. The rabbit was hungry and liked radishes. He saw his chance to gain a tasty snack. He hopped out of the bush and ran towards the radish. He bit it off with his sharp teeth and ran away with it in his mouth.
Lila and Tom stopped pulling and looked at the empty hole. They saw the rabbit running away with their radish. They felt sad and silly. They had lost their radish and their fun.
They looked at each other and said sorry.
"We should have shared the radish," said Lila.
"Yes, we should have been thoughtful," said Tom.
They hugged and decided to play something else. They learned to be more kind and fair with each other and with the plants. They hoped the rabbit enjoyed the radish.
