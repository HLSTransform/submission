One day, a cheerful boy named Tim went to the park to play. He saw a big truck with many things to load. Tim was excited to watch the truck. He knew something fun was going to happen.
Tim saw a man with a big ball. The man said, "We are going to play a game. Can you help me load the balls into the truck?" Tim was happy to help. They loaded all the balls into the truck together. The man told Tim, "Thank you! Come to the park tomorrow and see what we do with the balls."
The next day, Tim went to the park and saw many kids playing with the balls. They were trying to make a high score by throwing the balls into a big basket. Tim joined them and had lots of fun. He even made a new high score! The man from before smiled and said, "I knew you would have fun today. Thanks for your help!"
