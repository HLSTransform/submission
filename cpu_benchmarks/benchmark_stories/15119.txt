Once upon a time there was a little girl who was very lucky. She had a window in her bedroom which overlooked a beautiful garden. Every day she would get to push against the window and look out into the garden.
One day, when she was pushing against the window, something very special happened. A butterfly flew in and landed on the window sill. Taking a chance, the little girl gently poked the butterfly with her finger and it flew away. She was so excited and ran around the room in circles.
The next day, the little girl decided to spoil the butterfly and asked her parents for help. They got her some nectar from the flowers in the garden and she put it into a bowl on the window sill. Every morning, the butterfly came back for its breakfast. The little girl was always so excited to see its wings fluttering against the glass.
She was so lucky. The butterfly was always there to greet her when she woke up. Everyday was perfect.
