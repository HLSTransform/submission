Lila loves dolphins. She has a big picture of a dolphin on her wall. She likes to look at the dolphin and pretend she is swimming with it. She wants to see a real dolphin one day.
One day, Lila goes to the zoo with her mom and dad. They walk around and see many animals. Lila sees lions, monkeys, elephants, and birds. She likes them all, but she is looking for dolphins. She asks her mom, "Where are the dolphins?"
Her mom says, "They are in the big pool. Come, I will show you." They walk to the big pool. Lila sees water and waves. She sees something jump out of the water. It is a dolphin! Lila is very happy. She claps her hands and says, "Look, a dolphin!"
The dolphin is gray and shiny. It has a long nose and a big tail. It has a fin on its back. The fin is sharp. Lila knows not to touch the fin. The dolphin makes a funny sound. It sounds like a whistle. Lila laughs. She thinks the dolphin is saying hello.
The dolphin swims around the pool. It jumps and flips and spins. It splashes water on Lila and her mom and dad. They get wet and giggle. Lila thinks the dolphin is playing with them. She waves at the dolphin and says, "You are very smart and pretty. I like you, dolphin."
The dolphin sees Lila and waves back. It smiles and makes the funny sound again. It is happy too. It likes Lila and her mom and dad. It is proud of its tricks. It wants to show them more. Lila watches the dolphin and smiles. She feels a warm feeling in her heart. She loves the dolphin. She says, "Thank you, dolphin. You are my friend."
