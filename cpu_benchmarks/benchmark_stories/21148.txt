Jake was a kid who loved exploration. One summer afternoon he decided to go outside his house and explore his backyard. He found a wire that was new and shiny. He was excited and he ran around the yard with it.
The wire was interesting and Jake wanted to pick it up and see what it felt like. He bent down and picked the wire up with his hands. He rolled it around and held it tight.
When he picked it up, something strange happened. The wire began to spark and sparkle. Suddenly, a loud noise came from above and it started to rain. It was a new storm! 
Jake was amazed, but he also knew that he should put the wire down. He placed it back on the grass, and the sparks stopped. Jake was sad but he also knew that he had done the right thing. 
From that day on, Jake kept an eye on the wire whenever he played in the backyard. He was always interested to see if it sparked again or if the storm would return.
