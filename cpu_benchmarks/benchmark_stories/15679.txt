The little girl was outside in her garden. She was sad and wanted someone to talk to. She looked up to the sky and hoped for a friend. Suddenly a bright light appeared in the sky. It was beautiful.
The little girl was so excited. She jumped up and said “Hello? Is someone there?”
The light spoke back in a gentle voice. “Yes, I am here. I am a friendly star. What’s your name?”
The little girl was so surprised and happy. She said “My name is Lucy!”
“It is very nice to meet you, Lucy” said the star. “I am here to show you a new way.”
“What way?” asked Lucy.
“A way to happiness” said the star. “Let go of all the things that make you feel dead. Believe in yourself and hope for the best.”
Lucy was so happy. She thanked the star and said a goodbye. The star vanished and Lucy felt renewed. She smiled and skipped away. She was ready to find a new way.
