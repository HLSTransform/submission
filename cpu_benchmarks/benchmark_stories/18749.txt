Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys. Today, they have a new toy. It is a big train with many cars. They can make the train go on the tracks.
"Choo choo!" Anna says. She smiles and pushes the train. "This is fun!"
"Can I try?" Ben asks. He wants to play with the train too.
"OK, but you have to follow the order," Anna says. She likes to make rules. "First, you have to say please. Then, you have to wait for your turn. Then, you can play with the train for five minutes. Then, you have to give it back to me."
"Please, can I try?" Ben says. He follows the order. He waits for his turn. He plays with the train for five minutes. He gives it back to Anna.
"Thank you, Ben," Anna says. She smiles and hugs him. "You are a good brother."
"You are welcome, Anna," Ben says. He smiles and hugs her back. "You are a good sister."
They play with the train together. They share and take turns. They are happy. They have a new toy and a lot of fun.
