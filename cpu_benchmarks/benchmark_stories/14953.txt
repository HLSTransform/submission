Once there was a small mouse named Daisy. Daisy was looking for a special kind of cheese called rare cheese. She looked everywhere, but she could not find any. Then Daisy saw a small clearing in the woods. She hurried to the clearing and saw beautiful, colourful flowers blooming everywhere. Daisy had never seen anything so beautiful!
At last, Daisy noticed something shiny on one of the flowers. She rushed to the flower and found a piece of rare cheese! Daisy was so excited that she almost forgot to thank the flower. The flower spoke to Daisy and said, “You must never take cheese from these flowers without my permission. I don’t usually let visitors take my rare cheese.”
Daisy apologised to the flower and offered to do something in exchange for the cheese. The flower said, “I am happy to help you, but what can you do to help me?” Daisy felt a little embarrassed. She did not know how to help the flower.
Finally, Daisy said, “I will help you bloom by providing you with water and sunshine.” The flower was impressed and said, “Yes, I accept your offer.” Daisy thanked the flower and excitedly made her way home with the rare cheese.
