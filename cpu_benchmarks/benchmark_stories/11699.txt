Once upon a time, there was a little boy who loved cartoons. He watched them every day and dreamed of being a famous cartoonist one day. 
One day, he decided he wanted to work and make a cartoon of his own. He gathered some paper and colored pencils and tried to get started. But he found it really hard, and he felt helpless. He wanted to give up, but he kept trying.
Finally, one day he finished a cartoon. He was so proud of it and he showed it to all his friends. Everyone loved it and they said he should keep working and make more cartoons.
The little boy found a way to make cartoons, and since then he has made lots of amazing cartoons. They have been enjoyed by many happy people, and the little boy loves that he can make them.
The End.
