Mama and Papa had a stack of wood in the backyard. Every day, the wood pile would get smaller and smaller. Mama and Papa would haul the wood in the small cart to the houses of their neighbors.
One day, when Mama and Papa came home, they heard a loud noise. It was coming from the backyard. Mama and Papa walked over and saw a 3-year-old child, who was complaining loudly. Mama asked the child what was wrong.
The child said, "This stack of wood is too heavy. I can't move it!" Mama smiled and said, "No problem. Papa and I will help you move it. That way, it won't be too heavy for you."
Mama and Papa then helped the 3-year-old move the stack of wood. The child was so grateful for their help. After finishing the task, the 3-year-old thanked Mama and Papa for helping them move the wood. And from that day onwards, the 3-year-old had learned an important lesson: it's sometimes okay to ask for help.
