Mia and Leo are friends. They like to play together. One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big fountain with water. They run to the fountain and splash each other.
"Look, Mia, the water is so cool and nice!" Leo says.
"Yes, Leo, it is fun to play with water!" Mia says.
They laugh and have fun. But then, they hear a loud noise. It is a duck. The duck is angry. The duck thinks the fountain is his home. He does not like Mia and Leo. He quacks at them in a mean way.
"Quack, quack, quack! Go away, go away, go away!" the duck says.
Mia and Leo are scared. They do not understand the duck. The duck has a different language. They run away from the fountain and go to their moms.
"Mama, mama, there is a mean duck in the fountain!" Mia says.
"Mama, mama, the duck does not like us!" Leo says.
Their moms hug them and calm them down.
"Don't worry, Mia and Leo. The duck is just protecting his home. He does not know you are nice. He has a different language than you. But you can still be friends with him. You just have to be gentle and respectful." their moms say.
Mia and Leo nod. They understand. They go back to the fountain. They say sorry to the duck. They give him some bread. They watch him eat and swim. They smile and wave.
"Hello, duck. We are Mia and Leo. We are your friends." they say.
The duck quacks back. He is not angry anymore. He is happy. He has new friends.
"Quack, quack, quack! Hello, Mia and Leo. You are my friends." he says.
Mia and Leo are happy too. They have learned a new language. They have made a new friend. They play with the duck and the water. They are regular kids. They are having fun.
