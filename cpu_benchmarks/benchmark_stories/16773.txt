Tom and Mia were playing with their toys in the living room. Tom had a shiny red car and Mia had a soft yellow doll. They were having fun, until Tom saw Mia's doll and wanted it.
"Give me your doll!" Tom said. "It is nicer than my car."
"No!" Mia said. "It is mine. You have your car."
Tom did not listen. He grabbed Mia's doll and ran away. Mia was sad and angry. She followed Tom and tried to get her doll back.
"Stop!" Mia said. "That is not fair. You are mean."
Tom did not stop. He ran to the kitchen and hid behind the table. He held the doll tightly and smiled. He thought he was clever.
But he did not see the butter on the table. It was soft and slippery. When he leaned on the table, his hand touched the butter and slid off. He lost his balance and fell to the floor. The doll flew out of his hand and landed on Mia's lap. She caught it and hugged it.
"Ha!" Mia said. "You are silly. You dropped the doll and got butter on your hand."
Tom was not happy. He was hurt and dirty. He looked at his hand and saw the butter. It was dull and sticky. He did not like it. He wanted to wash it off.
"Help!" Tom said. "I have butter on my hand. It is yucky."
Mia looked at Tom and felt sorry for him. She was not mean. She decided to help him.
"Come on," Mia said. "Let's go to the sink and wash your hand. Then we can play again. But you have to be nice and share."
Tom nodded. He was sorry for taking Mia's doll. He learned his lesson. He followed Mia to the sink and washed his hand. Then they went back to the living room and played with their toys. They both had fun and remained friends.
