Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved animals. She visited the pet shop every day to pet all the furry animals.
One day, she saw a very cute, furry mouse and just had to have it. She asked the shopkeeper, and he said yes. She was so excited and hugged the mouse close.
The little girl named her new mouse Furry. Every day she held Furry and repeated sweet, happy words to her. She brushed her glossy fur and sang her special songs.
Furry soon became a very useful friend to the little girl. When the girl was feeling sad or lonely, Furry was always there to make her feel better. And every time Furry was scared, the girl would repeat words of comfort until she was happy again.
The little girl and Furry shared many happy moments together. They were the best of friends and their bond was very strong. For years and years, the little girl and Furry stayed together, always repeating words of love.
