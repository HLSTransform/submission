One day, there was a boy named Ben. He was three years old and he liked to play. Ben had a helmet and he liked to wear it everywhere he went.
One day, when Ben was playing outside, he saw two other boys fighting. They were hurting each other and Ben felt helpless. He knew he had to do something, so he decided to join in. He picked up his helmet, put it on and ran to the fight.
Ben jumped in the middle of the fight and yelled, “Stop!” The two boys stopped and looked at Ben to see what he was doing. Ben was brave and he had his helmet on to protect him.
The two boys saw how brave Ben was and they knew they were wrong. They both apologized and said they were sorry for fighting.
Ben smiled, glad that he had been able to help. He knew his helmet helped too!
