Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his dad's tools. One day, Timmy's dad introduced him to a new tool called a hammer. Timmy thought the hammer looked silly, but he was excited to try it out.
Timmy's dad showed him how to use the hammer to nail things together. Timmy thought it was so cool! He asked his dad if he could use the hammer to build a fort. His dad said yes and helped him gather all the tools they needed.
As Timmy worked on his fort, he accidentally hit his finger with the hammer. It hurt a lot! Timmy started to cry and his dad came over to see what was wrong. Timmy showed him his finger and his dad gave him a band-aid to make it feel better.
After that, Timmy was more careful when he used the tools. He knew that even though they could be fun, they could also be dangerous if he wasn't careful.
