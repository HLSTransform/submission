Once there was a little boy who wanted to hunt. He found a spear and went to the forest with it.
As soon as he got there, the boy started to look around. He pointed the spear at a tree and pretended he was hunting. Then he heard a noise. It was very noisy.
The little boy was scared so he stepped back very slowly. He was afraid that something bad was going to happen. But then he realized that the noise was only made by some animals.
The little boy was happy and he pointed the spear at the animals. He wanted to hunt them, but they ran away. The boy smiled as he watched them run. He was so happy! 
The little boy put the spear back in his pocket and went home. He was excited to tell his family about his adventure.
