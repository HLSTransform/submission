Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite dress that she loved to wear all the time. One day, the thread on her dress came loose and she was sad. She asked her mommy if she could fix it, and her mommy said yes.
Lily went to her mommy and made a request. She asked her mommy to fix the thread on her dress. Her mommy took the dress and fixed it with a needle and thread. When she was done, Lily was so happy and thanked her mommy.
Later that day, Lily's mommy made some lemonade. Lily took a sip and made a sour face. She didn't like it and asked her mommy if she could have something else to drink. Her mommy gave her some water and Lily was happy again. The end.
