John was sad because he missed his group. They used to do fun things together every day, but one day they stopped. Something stupid happened and they all stopped talking. John was very sad he couldn't see them anymore, he missed them all so much.
One day, he saw some of his friends walking in the park and he decided to join them. They were so surprised to see him, they welcomed him with big smiles. John was so happy. After that, the group got together again and they did all of their activities like before.
John was so pleased to be back in his group. He was so glad that something stupid hadn't ruined their friendship. Now all of them are together again and at the end of each day, John still misses them a lot.
