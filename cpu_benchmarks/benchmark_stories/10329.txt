Tom likes to go to the park with his mom. He likes to see the ducks and the flowers and the big trees. But his favorite thing is to feed the fish in the pond. The fish are green and shiny and they make funny noises when they eat.
One day, Tom and his mom go to the park with a bag of bread. Tom runs to the pond and throws some bread in the water. He sees the green fish come up and nibble the bread. He laughs and claps his hands. He wants to feed them more.
But his mom says, "Wait, Tom. You have to share the bread with the ducks too. They are hungry as well." She reminds him that the ducks are his friends and they like bread too. She gives him some more bread and shows him how to toss it to the ducks. The ducks quack and flap their wings and swim to the bread.
Tom watches the ducks and the fish eat the bread. He thinks they are both nice and funny. He says, "Mom, I like the ducks and the fish. Can we come back tomorrow and feed them again?" His mom smiles and hugs him. She says, "Yes, Tom. We can come back tomorrow and feed them again. They will be happy to see you." Tom is happy too. He loves the park and the ducks and the fish.
