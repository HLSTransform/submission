Once upon a time, there was a bossy cat named Max. Max liked to tell everyone what to do, even his friends. One day, Max and his friends were playing with some square blocks. Max wanted all the blocks for himself, but his friends wanted to play too. Max didn't want to share, so his friends went home.
Later that day, Max realized he didn't have enough blocks to build a tower. He needed more blocks! Max went to his friends' houses to ask for their blocks, but they didn't want to give them to him because he was being bossy. Max was sad and didn't know what to do. Then, his mom came and said she could supply him with more blocks from the store. Max was happy again and learned that sharing is important.
