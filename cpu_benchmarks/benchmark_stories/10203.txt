Once upon a time, there was a little rabbit named Remy. Remy was very alert and liked to play in the woods. One day, Remy saw a big hole near a tree. He was curious about what was inside the hole.
Remy called out, "Hello! Is anyone in the hole?" A small voice came from the hole. It was a tiny mouse named Mimi. Mimi said, "Hi, I live in this hole. Do you want to play with me?" Remy nodded and said, "Yes, let's play together!"
They played near the hole all day. They ran, jumped, and had so much fun. Before it got dark, Remy said, "I need to go home now. But I want to see you again." Mimi smiled and said, "I'll be here. Just look for the hole and call my name." Remy waved goodbye and ran back to his home, excited to play with his new friend again soon.
