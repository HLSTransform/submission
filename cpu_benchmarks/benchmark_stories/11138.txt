Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a little rhinoceros. He was scared of everything. One day, he saw a big tree and was scared to go near it. A kind bird saw the scared rhinoceros and wanted to help.
The bird said, "Don't be scared, little rhinoceros. I will help you." The bird flew up and pointed to the sky. "Look up there! The sun is shining, and it is a beautiful day. There is nothing to be scared of."
The little rhinoceros looked up and saw the sun. He felt better. The bird pointed to the tree and said, "This tree is your friend. It gives you shade and a place to rest." The little rhinoceros went near the tree and was not scared anymore. He learned that with a friend, there is no need to be scared. And they all lived happily in the big forest.
