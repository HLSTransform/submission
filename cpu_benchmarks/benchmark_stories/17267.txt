Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her cards. One day, she found a new card that made her very excited. It was a picture of a silly monkey. 
Lily showed the card to her brother, but he said it was stupid. Lily felt sad and didn't want to play anymore. But then, her mom came and saw the card. She said it was very cute and asked Lily to show her how to play with it. 
Lily was so happy that her mom liked her card. They played together and had lots of fun. Lily realized that even if someone thinks something is stupid, it doesn't mean it's not fun for someone else. From that day on, Lily always shared her cards with her mom and they had many exciting adventures together.
