Once upon a time, there was a fat caterpillar. The fat caterpillar liked to eat a lot. He ate many green leaves every day.
One day, the fat caterpillar saw a big shoe. The shoe had long strings that needed to be tied. The fat caterpillar wanted to help.
The fat caterpillar crawled on the shoe and tried to tie the strings. He used his tiny legs to pull and twist the strings. At last, the fat caterpillar tied the strings into a nice bow. The fat caterpillar was very happy that he could help.
