Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a shy little bunny named Tim. Tim loved to play near the river with his friends. They would splash in the water and have lots of fun.
One sunny day, Tim and his friends saw a big storm coming. They were scared that the storm would destroy their homes. So, they all worked together to make their homes strong and safe.
The storm came and went, and their homes were safe. The river was still there, and they could play again. Tim and his friends were very happy. They learned that when they work together, they can keep their homes safe and have fun by the river.
