Mommy and Daddy were very busy cleaning the house. They swept, mopped and scrubbed. It was hard work, but their house shone brightly.
After the cleaning was finished, Mommy made a tasty treat for everyone to enjoy. She mixed together flour, sugar, butter and eggs. Soon she had a batch of delicious muffins ready.
The family ate the muffins together. They were so tasty and Mommy was very proud of her work. Everyone licked the muffin crumbs off their fingers and smiled.
Mommy and Daddy said the house was now clean. The family hugged and thanked each other for their help. What a nice job they had done!
