Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was out for a walk with his mom. Suddenly, he saw a squash in the garden. The squash was juicy and looked really yummy.
The little boy was so excited! He excitedly grabbed the squash and ran back to his mom. She was very proud of him.
When they got home, his mom helped him cut the squash into little pieces. Then, she put it in a pot and cooked it on the stove.
Soon the squash was ready! He was so excited that he couldn't wait to eat. His mom put some of the squash on his plate and he couldn't believe how yummy it was. He ate all of it, and smiled because he was so happy.
