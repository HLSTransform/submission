Once upon a time, there was a little boat that lived in the sea. The boat wanted to explore the world, so it set sail every morning.
One day, the boat was sailing through the ocean, when it noticed a big salty wave. The boat was a bit scared, but it still tried to bravely sail through the wave.
Just then, two other boats came sailing past it. It was a race! The boats were very competitive, but the little boat didn't want to compete. It just wanted to explore the world.
Suddenly, the little boat noticed a tiny hole in the bottom of its boat. The salty wave had made the hole! Now, the little boat could not sail safely anymore.
The moral of the story is that it's important to focus on exploring rather than competing. We can still have fun, but it's best to be careful and not to let competition get in the way.
