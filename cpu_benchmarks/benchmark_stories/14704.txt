Once upon a time there was a white otter who loved to play in the river. Every day the otter would splash and swim with his friends. All was well until one day the otter couldn't resist playing too close to the bank.
The otter's splashing made a big mess and the otter was scolded by the other animals. To punish the otter for his carelessness, the animals made him apologize for his mess. At first the otter didn't want to apologize, but then he remembered how important it was to be polite and he said sorry.
The otter's mistake made him sad, and all the animals promised to be more careful in the future. The otter thanked them for understanding and promised to be more careful too. From then on all of the animals in the river were more careful and helped each other stay out of trouble.
