Once upon a time there was a big problem that a mom and a dad wanted to solve. But no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't fix it.
Suddenly a hug came to the rescue! The mom and dad gave each other a big hug, and it solved the problem. They were glad and happy that their problem was gone.
From then on, they both knew that a big hug can fix anything. Whenever they had a problem, they would give each other a big hug and it would make the problem go away.
The end.
