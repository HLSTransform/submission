Anna liked to examine things. She liked to look at them and touch them and ask questions. She wanted to know how they worked and why they were different. She examined her toys, her books, her clothes, and her pets.
One day, she decided to examine the bathtub. She climbed on a stool and looked inside. She saw water, soap, bubbles, and a rubber duck. She touched the water and felt it was warm. She touched the soap and felt it was slippery. She touched the bubbles and felt them pop. She touched the rubber duck and felt it squeak.
She thought the bathtub was attractive. It was shiny and white and had pretty patterns on the tiles. She liked the colors and the shapes. She liked how the water sparkled and the bubbles floated. She liked how the rubber duck smiled and the soap smelled.
She wanted to play in the bathtub. She took off her clothes and jumped in. She splashed and laughed and made more bubbles. She hugged the rubber duck and washed it with the soap. She had fun in the bathtub.
She did not hear her mom calling her. She did not see her mom coming in. She did not notice her mom's face. She only noticed her mom's voice when she said, "Anna, what are you doing? You are making a mess! You are supposed to examine things with your eyes, not with your whole body!"
