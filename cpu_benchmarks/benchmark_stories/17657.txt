Once upon a time there was a wealthy family. They had lots of money, but they weren't happy. The dad was always angry and his son felt bad.
One day the dad got very mad. He slapped his son in the face. The poor boy was so sad. He cried and he ran away.
The son went to a store and bought a glass. It was really pretty so he kept it. 
He went to the park and set the glass down on a bench. Suddenly the dad appeared. He was still really angry. He saw the glass and he got very mad. He picked it up and threw it on the ground. It crashed and broke into tiny pieces. 
The dad was sorry. He hugged his son and told him he was sorry for slapping him. The son forgave his dad and they went home together. From then on, the family was very happy.  They shared lots of nice hugs and smiles.
