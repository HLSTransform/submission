Once upon a time, there was a big, huge elephant named Ellie. Ellie loved to carry things with her long trunk. One day, she was walking in the jungle when she saw a little monkey named Max.
Max said, "Ellie, can you help me? I lost the key to my lock and I can't get into my treehouse."
Ellie replied, "Of course, Max! I can use my trunk to carry you up to your treehouse and we can look for the key together."
So, Ellie lifted Max up with her trunk and carried him to his treehouse. They searched and searched until they found the key under a leaf. Max was so happy that he gave Ellie a big hug and said, "Thank you, Ellie! You are the best friend ever!"
Ellie smiled and replied, "No problem, Max. It was my pleasure to help you." And with that, they both went back to playing in the jungle.
