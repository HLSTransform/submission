Once upon a time there was a girl named Sarah. She was three years old. She was playing on her tricycle outside her house. Suddenly she had a wonderful idea. She decided to go for a drive using her parents' cart.
When Sarah got to the cart, it was dirty and very filthy. She took a cloth from her pocket and tried to clean it.
Sarah: "How do I get this cart clean?" she asked.
At that moment, a magical fairy appeared.
Fairy: "I can help you," said the fairy.
So, the fairy waved her wand and with a "Poof!", the cart became as clean as new. 
Sarah was very happy. She quickly hopped into the cart and took the reins. The cart began to move and Sarah started to lead the way. She drove around happily for hours, leading the cart wherever she wanted to go. 
Finally, the sun started to set. Sarah knew it was time to go home. She thanked the fairy and started heading back to her house. It had been a great adventure leading the cart around, and Sarah knew she would remember it for always.
