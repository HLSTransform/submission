Once upon a time there was an old man. He had a big stick and was walking along a path. At the end of the path there was a big, deep puddle. The old man could see his reflection in the puddle. He wanted to make it look shiny. So he rubbed his stick against the surface of the puddle. He rubbed, and rubbed, and rubbed until his stick was wet and the puddle was sparkling! When he was done, he looked at his reflection again. He smiled and was very pleased. Then, the old man continued walking along the path.
