Once upon a time there was a brave and adventurous rhinoceros. Every day the rhinoceros wanted to go on an adventure, so she always packed her favorite things and set off on a journey to explore the world.
One day, the rhinoceros came across a river she had never seen before. She wanted to get to the other side, so she decided to pay a duck to take her across the river. The duck was very happy and agreed to help. He swam across the river with the rhinoceros on his back and paid him a big smile of thanks when they reached the other side.
The rhinoceros was so pleased to be on the other side of the river and the duck was very happy that he had helped. From then on, the duck and the rhinoceros were the best of friends and went on many more adventurous adventures together.
