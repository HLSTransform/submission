Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy liked to play with his toy cars in his garage. One day, Timmy's dad asked him to clean the garage. Timmy didn't know how to clean the garage, but he wanted to help his dad. 
Timmy looked around the garage and saw that it was very messy. There were toys and tools all over the floor. He knew that he needed to make it clear so that his dad could park the car inside. Timmy started picking up the toys and tools and putting them in their right places. 
After a while, Timmy's dad came to see how he was doing. He was happy to see that Timmy was helping him. Timmy was proud of himself because he knew that he did a good job. From that day on, Timmy made sure to keep the garage clear so that his dad could park the car inside.
