Once upon a time, there was a playful puppy named Max. Max loved to run and jump in the park. One day, Max's owner gave him a treat. It was a yummy bone that Max loved to chew on. After playing for a while, Max got thirsty and went to drink some water from his bowl. Max was happy and content with his treat and water. The end.
