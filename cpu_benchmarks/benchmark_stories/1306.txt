Once upon a time there was a flower who bloomed. She was a very pretty flower and everyone could see how sparkly she was. But she was too shy to show off her beauty.
One day the flower decided it was time to bloom. She started to stretch her petals and open to the world. She felt so happy that she sparkled even more, which made her even more shy. She was so ashamed to show off her beauty and she wanted to hide.
But no matter how much she wanted to hide, the flower's sparkly petals kept getting bigger and bigger until everyone around could see her beauty. The flower was so happy that she bloomed and she was no longer ashamed of her beauty. From then on, the flower bloomed proudly every day!
