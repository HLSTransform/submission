Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He had a toy sword that he loved to play with. One day, while playing, Tim's sword broke. He was very sad and wanted to repair it.
Tim went to his mom and said, "Mom, my sword is broken. Can you help me fix it?" His mom looked at the sword and said, "Yes, we can repair it, but we need to make it safe so you don't get hurt."
The next day, Tim and his mom went to the store to find something to make the sword safe. They found a soft cover for the sharp part of the sword. They put the cover on the sword, and it was fixed and safe to play with again.
Tim was so happy and said, "Thank you, Mom, for helping me repair my sword and making it safe." From that day on, Tim played with his sword every day, and he was always careful to keep it safe.
