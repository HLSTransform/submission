Tom and Lily were playing on the shore. They liked to dig in the sand and find shells and stones. They also liked to splash in the water and watch the waves.
"Look, Lily, I found a big shell!" Tom said, holding up his treasure.
"Wow, Tom, it's so pretty! Can I see?" Lily said, running over to him.
They took turns looking at the shell and listening to the sound inside. They wondered if there was a sea creature living in it.
They decided to put the shell in their bucket with the other things they found. They were having so much fun, they didn't notice the sky getting dark and the wind getting strong.
Suddenly, they heard a loud roar. They looked up and saw a fierce storm coming. The waves were big and angry, and the rain was falling hard.
"Tom, Lily, come here!" their mom shouted from the car. "It's time to go home!"
Tom and Lily grabbed their bucket and ran to the car. They were wet and cold, but they were also happy. They had a great adventure on the shore.
They got in the car and buckled their seat belts. Their mom gave them a towel and a hug. She said they were brave and smart.
Tom and Lily smiled and cuddled with their mom. They were tired from playing. They closed their eyes and took a nap. They dreamed of the shore and the shell and the storm.
