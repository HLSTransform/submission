Once upon a time there was a boy called Dan. He loved his purple wallet.
It helped him to keep all his things safe and stay organised. He took it everywhere with him.
One day, while Dan was outside playing, a thief snuck up to him and tried to take his purple wallet away. But Dan yelled and screamed so loudly that the thief ran away.
When Dan got home, he hugged his wallet and realised how much he valued it. It was so special to him.
Ever since that day, Dan has been sure to keep his wallet close to him, so it always stays safe. Because he knows how much it's worth.
