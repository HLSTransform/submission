Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a nosy bunny named Bob. Bob liked to hop around and see what his friends were doing. One day, he saw his friend, a squirrel named Sam, looking sad.
Bob asked, "Sam, why are you sad?" Sam said, "I want to play with my ball, but it keeps rolling into the street. I don't want to get hurt."
Bob thought hard and had an idea. He said, "Let's build a little fence to prevent the ball from going into the street." They worked together and built the fence. It stopped the ball from rolling away.
Sam was happy and said, "Thank you, Bob! You have a big heart." They played together all day and had lots of fun. From that day on, Bob learned that being nosy can sometimes be helpful.
