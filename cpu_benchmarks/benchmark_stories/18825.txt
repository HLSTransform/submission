Anna and Ben were twins who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big house with a shiny car and a nice garden. They wondered who lived there.
"Maybe it is a rich person who has a lot of toys and candy," Anna said.
"Maybe it is a king or a queen who has a lot of money and clothes," Ben said.
They decided to sneak into the house and see for themselves. They climbed over the fence and ran to the door. It was open, so they went inside.
The house was very big and beautiful. There were many rooms with soft beds, colorful paintings, and shiny things. Anna and Ben felt like they were in a dream. They wanted to try everything.
They went to the bathroom and saw a big shower. It had many buttons and knobs that made different sounds and colors. They thought it was a fun game.
"Let's take a shower," Anna said.
"OK, but don't use too much water," Ben said.
They turned on the shower and jumped in. They laughed and splashed and sang. They did not hear the footsteps coming up the stairs.
It was the owner of the house, who had just come back from work. He was very angry when he saw the water running and the door open. He followed the noise and found Anna and Ben in his shower.
"Hey, what are you doing here?" he shouted.
Anna and Ben were scared. They turned off the shower and ran out of the bathroom. They grabbed their clothes and ran to the door. They did not say sorry or thank you.
They climbed over the fence and ran to the park. They were wet and cold and sad. They had gained nothing but trouble. They wished they had never gone to the big house.
They learned a lesson that day. They learned that being rich is not only about having things, but also about being kind and respectful. They learned that being happy is not only about playing, but also about being honest and grateful. They learned that being curious is good, but also being careful. They learned that the best things in life are not always in big houses, but in small hearts.
