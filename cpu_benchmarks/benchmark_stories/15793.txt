Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved picking berries in the woods. One day, she went to pick berries but found something even better- an incredible berry bush! It was loaded with huge, juicy berries and the little girl was so excited! She couldn't believe what she was seeing! 
The little girl paused while filling her basket. Suddenly, she heard a noise. A baby bear was walking up to her from the woods! She froze in fear. The bear came closer and closer until it stopped in front of her. "Would you like to eat some of these delicious berries with me?" it asked with a smile. 
The little girl was so surprised that she could barely answer. Finally, she said, "Yes, I would love to!" She and the baby bear shared the incredible berries together, talking and laughing until the sun went down. 
The little girl said goodbye to her new friend and ran home, happy and full of the most delicious berries. She couldn't wait to come back and pick berries with the baby bear again!
