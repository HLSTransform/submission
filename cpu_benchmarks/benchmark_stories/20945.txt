Once upon a time, there was a Pixie who wanted to surprise all of his friends. So one day he decided to plan a meeting. He told his friends to wear their best clothes, but then he told them that the meeting was very cheap. 
The Pixie's friends were delighted! They showed up to the meeting wearing their best clothes, but they were surprised to find they didn't need to spend any money at all. Instead, the Pixie had planned a fun game and some tasty treats. Everyone had a great time. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to share with others. Even if you don't have a lot of money, you can still surprise your friends in special and unforgettable ways. Even a simple game or treat can make someone's day!
