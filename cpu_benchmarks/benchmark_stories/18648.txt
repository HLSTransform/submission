Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mommy in the kitchen. One day, her mommy asked her to help make a special treat for their neighbor who was very sick. They decided to make a basket of cookies and wrap it up with a pretty bow.
Lily helped her mommy mix the dough and shape the cookies. They baked them in the oven and let them cool. Then, they put them in a basket and wrapped it with a pretty pink ribbon. They walked over to their neighbor's house and gave her the basket of cookies. She was very happy and thanked them for their kindness.
A few days later, there was a knock on Lily's door. It was the neighbor's daughter who was very wealthy. She thanked Lily and her mommy for the basket of cookies and gave them a big bag of money as a thank you. Lily and her mommy were very surprised and happy. They learned that sometimes when you do something nice for others, good things can happen to you too.
