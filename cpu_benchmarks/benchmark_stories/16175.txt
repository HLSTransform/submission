Once upon a time there was a little mouse, who was very wise. Every day he used his wisdom to try and find the best way to live.
One day he decided to try and find a home. So he used all his wisdom and hopped into a soft bed of hay.
He was quite happy in his new home, but then he heard a loud noise. It was coming from a nearby meadow.
He used his wisdom to stay safe and listened carefully. He heard a voice saying, "You can have a wonderful home here, if you use your wisdom!"
At first, he was scared but then he realised that the voice was kind and gentle. He had used his wisdom to find the right home!
From then on, the little mouse was very proud of his new home and he used his wisdom to make his world even better.
