Once upon a time there was an adventurous elephant. This elephant loved exploring wild places. One day, when the elephant was walking through the forest, he came across a rubber. He wanted to take it home to show his friends, so he stretched out his trunk to pick it up.
Suddenly, a little bird swooped down from the sky. "Please don't take the rubber," the bird said. "The rubber belongs to everyone and everyone should share it."
The elephant thought about this for a moment and then slowly put the rubber down. The little bird smiled and said, "Thank you. It teaches us all an important lesson: to always be kind and share with one other."
The elephant smiled and thought to himself, sharing really is a wonderful thing. He took one last look at the rubber before heading back into the wild.
