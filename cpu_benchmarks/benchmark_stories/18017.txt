Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Timmy. Timmy was very curious and loved to explore. One day, he found a tunnel that was dark and scary. Timmy was scared but he wanted to be brave, so he went inside the tunnel.
As he was walking, he found a piece of cheese. He was so happy and proud of himself for finding it. He ate the cheese and continued walking. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise and got scared. He wanted to go back home.
Timmy remembered the way he came and started to return back to his home. He was happy to see the sunlight and ran as fast as he could. When he got home, he told his family about his adventure and how proud he was of himself for being brave.
