Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big, wide pond with many ducks and geese. Lily liked the geese. They had long necks and white feathers. She wanted to feed them some bread.
"Come on, Ben, let's go to the pond!" Lily said.
"OK, Lily, but be careful. Geese can bite," Ben said.
They ran to the pond and threw some bread to the geese. The geese came closer and ate the bread. Lily and Ben laughed and clapped. They saw one goose that was different. It had a red ribbon around its neck.
"Look, Ben, that goose has a ribbon. It is so pretty," Lily said.
"Maybe it is someone's pet. Maybe it is lost," Ben said.
They wanted to touch the goose with the ribbon. They walked slowly to the goose. The goose did not run away. It looked at them with its black eyes.
"Hello, goose. Do you have a name?" Lily asked.
The goose did not answer. It honked softly.
"Can we pet you, goose?" Ben asked.
The goose nodded its head. Lily and Ben reached out their hands and stroked the goose's feathers. The goose was soft and warm. It liked Lily and Ben.
"Can we take you home, goose?" Lily asked.
The goose shook its head. It pointed its beak to the pond.
"You want to stay here, goose?" Ben asked.
The goose nodded its head. It honked loudly.
"OK, goose, we understand. You like the pond. You have friends here," Lily said.
The goose smiled. It gave Lily and Ben a hug with its wings.
"Thank you, goose. You are very nice. We will come back and visit you," Ben said.
The goose waved its wing. It watched Lily and Ben run back to their mom.
"Bye, goose. See you soon," Lily and Ben said.
The goose was happy. It had made new friends. It buried its head in its feathers and dreamed of Lily and Ben.
