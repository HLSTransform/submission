Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to sit in her armchair and read her favorite books. One day, Lily's mom told her that they were going to visit her grandma's house. Lily was very excited because she loved her grandma's house, but she was also a little scared because she had to cross a dangerous road to get there.
Lily's mom said, "Don't worry, Lily. I have a plan to keep us safe. We will hold hands and look both ways before we cross the road." Lily felt much better knowing that her mom had a plan.
When they arrived at grandma's house, Lily ran to her favorite armchair and picked up a book. Her grandma asked, "What book are you reading, Lily?" Lily replied, "It's a book about a princess who goes on an adventure to save her kingdom." 
Lily's grandma smiled and said, "That sounds like a fun story. Do you have a plan for how the princess will save her kingdom?" Lily thought for a moment and said, "Yes, she will use her magic powers to defeat the evil dragon." 
Lily's mom and grandma were proud of her for coming up with a plan for the story. They all sat together in the armchair and read the book, feeling happy and safe.
