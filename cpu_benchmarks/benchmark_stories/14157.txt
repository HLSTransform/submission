Once upon a time there were two friends, Janie and John. They were walking in the woods and were having lots of fun. Suddenly, they noticed a deep pit in the ground.
Janie said to John, “Let’s jump in! I bet it’s fun.” But John continued walking and said, “No, that looks too tough for us. It might be dangerous.” Janie wanted to keep going but John wanted to remain safe.
Janie asked John, “Why don’t you be brave like me? We could jump in and have a great time!” But John shook his head and said, “No, it would be too risky. We should just keep walking.”
Finally, Janie was convinced. She realized that being brave wasn’t always the best option. The moral of the story is that it’s important to remain safe and use your head.
