Once upon a time there was a dry bow. It was very plain and simple, but it was special to a little boy. He was the only one who could make the bow fly.
One day he decided to take the bow outside to fly it. The bow started to fly around the sky, higher and higher.
The boy watched the bow in amazement. Then he shouted, "Faster, bow! Fly as fast as you can!"
And the bow did just that. It flew so fast that the boy couldn't keep up.
Soon he couldn't even see it anymore. He was sad but also very proud of his bow.
He said, "Goodbye, bow. I'll see you soon, I hope!" And then the bow flew away into the sunset.
