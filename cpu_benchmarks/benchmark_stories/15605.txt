Sam and Mia like to play with their toy planes. They make zoom and beep sounds and pretend to fly in the sky. Sam has a red plane and Mia has a blue plane. They are both happy.
But then, Ben comes and takes Sam's plane. Ben is a bad boy. He does not like to share. He says, "This is my plane now. Go away!" Sam is sad and angry. He wants his plane back.
Mia sees Ben and says, "Give Sam his plane, Ben. That is not nice. You have your own plane." Ben has a green plane, but he does not care. He says, "No, I like this plane better. It is faster and cooler. You can't tell me what to do."
Mia has an idea. She says to Sam, "Let's poke Ben. Maybe he will drop the plane." Sam nods and smiles. They sneak behind Ben and poke him with their fingers. Ben is surprised and shouts, "Ow! Stop that! That hurts!"
Sam and Mia poke him again and again. Ben drops the red plane and runs away. He cries, "You are mean! You are not my friends!" Sam and Mia pick up the red plane and hug each other. They say, "We are the pilots. We are the good ones. We are the best friends." They play with their planes again and have fun.
