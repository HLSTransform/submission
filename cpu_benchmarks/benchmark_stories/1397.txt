Once upon a time there was a fair flea who wanted to find a place to fit. He looked left, he looked right, but he couldn't find a spot that was just right. He flew up high in the sky and he flew low and all around, but he just couldn't find a place to fit. He began to get very tired and he was about to give up when he saw a big dog, stretching and laying in the sun. The fair flea watched for a bit and, when the big dog stood up and started running around, a space was formed between his shoulders. The flea flew in quickly, putting himself in just the right spot! He fit perfectly and from that spot he could see everything. And so the fair flea found his place and he was very happy. The end.
