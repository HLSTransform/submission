Once upon a time, there was a silly boy who loved to run. He would run across the yard and around the trees every day. One morning, he decided to run up the stairs. As he began to run, he noticed something strange. It was a big white sheet on the stair. He stopped running and suddenly he had a brilliant idea. He grabbed the sheet, tied it around his body and shouted "I'm a ghost!" He took off running up the stairs while he loudly yelled "Boo!" He was so excited! He ran from room to room, laughing and making silly noises. He ran up and down the stairs and around the house, so pleased with himself for making a ghost costume out of a sheet. After a long morning of running ghost, the silly boy was tired and went to take a nap.
