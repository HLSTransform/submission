Sam liked his new bicycle. It was bright red and shiny. He wanted to ride it fast and far. But he was scared. He did not know how to balance on two wheels. He had a helmet and pads, but he still felt afraid.
His big sister, Lily, saw him sitting on the grass with his bicycle. She wanted to help him. She said, "Sam, you can do it. I will teach you how to ride. It is fun and easy. You just have to try." She encouraged him to get on his bicycle and hold the handlebars. She held the back of his seat and ran with him. She said, "Pedal, Sam, pedal. Look ahead, not down. You are doing great."
Sam felt his bicycle move faster and faster. He felt the wind in his face and the sun on his back. He felt happy and proud. He did not notice that Lily had let go of his seat. He was riding by himself. He shouted, "Lily, look, I'm riding!"
Lily smiled and clapped. She said, "You did it, Sam, you did it! You are a great rider. I knew you could do it." She ran to him and gave him a hug. She said, "Let's go for a ride together. We can explore the park and see the flowers and the birds. Come on, Sam, let's go."
Sam nodded and smiled. He followed Lily on his bright red bicycle. He was not scared anymore. He was happy and excited. He had learned how to ride. He had a new skill and a new friend. He thanked Lily for encouraging him. He said, "Lily, you are the best sister ever."
