One day, Molly and her mommy went to the park. They had a good time playing together.
At the park there was a sign that read "Free Treats Today". Molly was very excited. She asked her mommy, "Please, can I have a treat?"
Her mommy said, "Yes, sweetheart. But first we have to make sure you know how to be a good girl."
Molly promised to be a good girl and followed her mommy over to the sign. Her mommy said to the nice man, "My daughter would like a treat please."
The nice man smiled and gave Molly a treat. Molly was so happy. She thanked the man and said goodbye.
As they walked away, Molly turned around and waved goodbye to the nice man. He smiled and waved back. Then they went home with a good feeling in their hearts.
