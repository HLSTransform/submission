One day, John had a grape. He wanted to take it, but it was too high. John tried to reach it, but he could not. He felt very frustrated.
John called his dad to help him get the grape. His dad smiled and took a stool. He stepped onto the stool and took the grape down.
John was very excited. He thanked his dad and took the grape. He ran to the kitchen and put the grape on the table. He took a bite and it tasted yummy!
John was glad that his dad helped him. He was no longer frustrated!
