Sammy's parents had a new bulb that they needed to collect. It was a big, round bulb that lit up the entire house.
Sammy was very curious about the bulb, so his parents reminded him to be very careful with it. But Sammy was careless and ended up dropping the bulb. It made a loud crashing noise.
His parents were very disappointed and told Sammy he couldn't have the new bulb anymore. Sammy felt very sad but he knew it was his fault.
The following day, the family went back to the shop to buy the bulb again. When they arrived at the shop, they saw a little girl collecting the same bulb they needed.
The girl was being very careful with the bulb and Sammy learned a valuable lesson. He promised he would be more careful with special items and make his parents proud.
