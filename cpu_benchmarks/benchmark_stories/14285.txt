Once there was a little girl. She was three years old and liked to read books. One day, she saw a shiny book on the table. She went over and opened it up. Inside, she found lots of helpful words. 
The little girl was excited to read all the words in the book. She turned to the first page and began to read. She was so happy to learn new things. With each turn of the page she discovered more helpful stories, pictures and phrases. 
The little girl smiled as she read the book. She was so glad the book was helpful and she could improve her reading skills. Reading was so fun! The girl was so proud of herself and thankful for the book that helped her learn.
