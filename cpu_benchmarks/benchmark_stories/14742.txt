Lily and Ben wanted to go camping in the garden. They had a big tent that their dad gave them. They put the tent on the grass and tried to fill it with air. But the air pump was broken. It made a loud noise and no air came out.
"Oh no, what do we do now?" Lily asked.
"Maybe we can blow into it with our mouths," Ben said.
They took turns blowing into the tent, but it was very hard. They got tired and dizzy. The tent was still flat and floppy.
"This is no fun," Lily said. "I want to go inside and watch TV."
"No, we can't give up," Ben said. "We have to be patient. Maybe dad can fix the pump."
They waited for their dad to come home from work. They sat on the grass and looked at the sky. They saw some clouds that looked like animals. They played a game of guessing what they were.
"Look, that one is a rabbit," Lily said.
"And that one is a dragon," Ben said.
They laughed and had fun. They forgot about the tent for a while.
Soon, they heard their dad's car in the driveway. They ran to him and hugged him.
"Dad, dad, can you help us?" Lily said.
"What's wrong, kids?" dad asked.
"Our tent is broken. The pump doesn't work. Can you fix it?" Ben said.
Dad looked at the tent and the pump. He smiled and nodded.
"Sure, I can fix it. It's just a loose wire. You two have been very patient. Let me get my tools and I'll have it ready in no time."
Lily and Ben cheered. They thanked their dad and helped him carry the tools. They watched him fix the pump and fill the tent with air. The tent became big and round and cozy.
"Wow, it's amazing," Lily said.
"Thank you, dad. You're the best," Ben said.
Dad hugged them and kissed them.
"You're welcome, kids. I'm proud of you. You didn't give up and you had fun. Now you can enjoy your camping adventure. Do you want me to join you?"
"Yes, please," Lily and Ben said.
They all went inside the tent and snuggled together. They told stories and sang songs. They had a wonderful time. They were happy.
