The sky was grey and it began to rain. The raindrops were big and cold. The little girl was sad because she wanted to play outside but now it rained.
Her mom saw that she was sad and brought out a big yellow banana. The little girl smiled as she ate the banana. The sweet taste made her happy again. 
But mom had a surprise too. She brought out a fake banana made of plastic. The little girl was excited to eat the fake banana. She pretended to take bites out of it and played with it for a long time. 
 
The rain stopped and the sun came out. The little girl smiled and ran outside to play. Her fake banana stayed indoors and stayed dry.
