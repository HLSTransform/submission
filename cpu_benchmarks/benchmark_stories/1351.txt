Once upon a time there was a brave boy named Jack. He was three years old. One day, Jack wanted to try to do something special. He got an object and tried to figure out what to do with it. But he couldn't make it work. He got very mad and yelled, "This is terrible!" 
Jack's mom heard him and knew he was upset. She said, "Jack, don't worry. Let's try it together and see if we can figure it out." Jack and his mom worked together to figure out how to get the object to do what Jack wanted it to. 
Finally, Jack and his mom found success. Jack was so happy that he hugged his mom. He clutched the object close and said, "It's not terrible anymore!" From that day on, Jack learned that if he tried hard enough, anything could be made better.
