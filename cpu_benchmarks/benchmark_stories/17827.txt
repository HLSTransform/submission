Once upon a time there was a little boy named Bob. Bob lived in a big house with his regular family. One day, Bob wanted to play a game. He asked them if they wanted to play with him.
So they all stood up and held hands together in a circle. They started jumping around the floor and they said, "Let's play a game of parts". Bob was so excited!
Suddenly they heard a noise coming from the living room. They ran to see what was happening. It was Bob's little brother. He was playing with a toy car on the floor, and it rolled across the room. Bob and his family laughed, it was a funny sight.
Bob and his family decided it was time for a break. They all sat on the floor. The floor was regular and comfortable. Bob and his family were so happy.
The end.
