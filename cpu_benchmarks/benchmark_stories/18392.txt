Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved ice cream, especially when it came in a cone. One day, she went to the ice cream truck and got a big cone with lots of flavors. She was so happy!
Suddenly, her little brother came and asked for some ice cream. Lily didn't want to share because she wanted it all for herself. But then she felt guilty and decided to pass him a little bit of her cone. He was very happy too!
From that day on, Lily learned that sharing is important and it made her feel good inside. She always made sure to pass a little bit of her cone to her brother and friends. And they all lived happily ever after, enjoying their ice cream cones together. The end.
