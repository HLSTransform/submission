Lily liked spring. Spring was when the sun was warm and the flowers were pretty. Spring was when she could play outside with her dog, Spot. Spot liked spring too. He liked to run and jump and dig.
One day, Lily and Spot went to the park. They saw a pond with ducks and frogs. Lily wanted to feed the ducks some bread. Spot wanted to chase the frogs. Lily threw some bread in the water. Spot ran after a frog. He jumped in the pond and got wet and muddy.
Lily laughed. Spot looked funny. He was brown and green and wet. He shook his fur and splashed Lily. Lily got wet too. She did not mind. She liked to play with Spot.
But then, Lily heard her mom call her name. It was time to go home. Lily and Spot ran to her mom. Her mom saw them and smiled. She said they had fun, but they were very dirty. She said they had to wash before they ate.
Lily and Spot went home with her mom. Her mom gave them a bath. She used soap and water and a sponge. She washed them until they were clean and shiny. She dried them with a towel. She said they were good and safe.
Lily and Spot felt happy. They liked to wash. They liked to be clean and safe. They liked spring. They liked their mom. They hugged her and said thank you. They ate some food and drank some water. They were tired from playing. They went to sleep and dreamed of spring.
