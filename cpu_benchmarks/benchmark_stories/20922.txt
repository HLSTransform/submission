Once upon a time there was a small village. In this village everyone was sad, because they had no food. One day a stranger came to the village. He had a big bag and in it he had many things. He gathered everyone together. He said that he was very happy and wanted to share some things with the village.
He said he had a razor, which he wanted to use to help them. Everyone was excited but confused. So the stranger said that if they gave him some water and some spices he would use the razor to make a soup for them.
Everyone got to work and gather the water and spices. Soon enough the soup was ready. When everyone tasted it the soup was so spicy! Everyone was delighted and thanked the stranger for his help.
The villagers had never felt so happy and were surprised at how something so simple could make them feel so much more full. The stranger smiled and said he was glad that his razor had helped make something so delicious. Everyone in the village thanked him again and they all ate together and shared stories of their day. The stranger had made a big difference in the lives of the people in the village.
