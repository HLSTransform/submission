Once upon a time, imagine a dependable rabbit. It was a fluffy brown rabbit and its name was Colby. Colby was very happy and loved to hop around in the grass. All the other animals in the forest knew that they could depend on Colby! 
One day, Colby was going to visit a friend that lived far away in another part of the forest. Colby hopped and hopped until suddenly he became very tired. He needed someplace safe to have a nap as he was very far away from home. 
Colby remembered a cozy tree that he had seen a few more hops away. So he hopped and hopped until he reached the tree. Colby curled up inside the tree and went to sleep. He soon felt safe and warm in his little tree house.
Colby slept and slept until the sun began to rise. He was happy to be home safe and sound. All the other animals in the forest were very happy to see Colby, because they knew that Colby was dependable and had kept his promise! 
The end.
