Once upon a time there was a wide and adventurous forest. In the middle of the forest lived a little bear called Bob. Bob was always looking for new and exciting things to do. One day Bob heard a sound in the forest, it was a peculiar sound like something he had never heard before - it was the sound of music.
Bob tiptoed towards the music and saw a group of animals dancing in a big circle. He was curious so he asked one of them, "What are you doing?"
The animal answered, "We are dancing! Would you like to join us?"
Bob was excited and he jumped in the circle and began to dance too. They danced around in the magical forest and it made them feel so happy and adventurous!
That night Bob went to sleep with a big smile on his face. He knew that dancing was a wonderful way to spend his days and he was very happy that he was brave and adventurous enough to join the dance.
