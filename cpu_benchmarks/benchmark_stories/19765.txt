Peter was very excited. Today, he was going to make something all by himself. He took out a large bag of coffee beans and a grinder. He put some of the beans into the grinder and turned it on. As he did, the beans began to yield their grounds. 
Peter watched in amazement. After grinding for a few minutes, he scooped out the grounds and put them into a filter. He poured in some hot water and waited for the coffee to drip down. 
When the coffee was done, he poured it into a cup and tried it. Peter smiled when he tasted the tasty coffee and he was very happy. He couldn't believe he could make something so delicious with his own two hands. He couldn't wait to make more!
