Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a shiny red bicycle that he loved to ride. One day, Timmy's friend Billy came over to play. Billy saw Timmy's bicycle and felt jealous because he didn't have one. 
Timmy let Billy ride his bicycle and they had fun together. They rode around the block and marked their path with chalk on the ground. Billy felt happy to ride the bicycle and forgot about feeling jealous. 
After they finished riding, Timmy and Billy went inside to have some snacks. Timmy's mom gave them cookies and milk. They talked about how much fun they had riding the bicycle together. Billy realized that he didn't need to be jealous because he had a good friend like Timmy.
