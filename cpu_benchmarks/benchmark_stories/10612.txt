Once upon a time, there lived a young boy named Pete. 
Pete loved to imagine he was king of the world! One day he imagined a special hut in an unknown land. It was made from a tree and had a door with a star-shaped knob.
Inside the hut, Pete found a toy chest full of treasures. He couldn't believe his eyes! He opened the chest, and out flew a box of glittering stars. They swirled all around the hut, and the room, filled with happiness and excitement.
Pete could not believe his luck. He stayed in the hut all day, playing with the stars and all the other treasures in the chest. After a while, he left the hut, taking all the stars and treasures with him.
He never knew where the hut came from or why it was there, but he was happy that it was. He kept the treasures close and imagined adventures with them every day. And in his dreams the stars shined brightly!
