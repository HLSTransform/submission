Anna and Ben are playing in the garden. They have a big hose and a small bucket. They fill the bucket with water and splash each other. They laugh and have fun.
But then, Anna sees a leak in the hose. Water is coming out of a hole. She says to Ben, "Look, there is a leak! We have to hurry and fix it!"
Ben nods and runs to the shed. He looks for something to stop the leak. He finds some tape and some string. He brings them to Anna.
They wrap the tape and the string around the hole. They pull them tight. They hope it will work.
They turn on the hose again. They wait and watch. The water flows out of the end, but not out of the hole. They did it! They fixed the leak!
They cheer and hug. They go back to playing with the hose and the bucket. They are happy and proud.
