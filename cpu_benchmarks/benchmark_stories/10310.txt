Tim and Jen like to play in the park. They have a big sack with toys and snacks. They run and jump and slide and swing. They have fun.
But the sun is very hot. It makes them sweat and thirsty. They look for a place to rest. They see a big tree with green leaves. It makes a lot of shade under it. They run to the tree and sit down.
They open the sack and take out some juice and cookies. They drink and eat and talk. They hear a loud noise. They look up and see a big bird. It is a crow. It has black feathers and a yellow beak. It is on a branch above them.
The crow sees the sack. It wants the juice and cookies. It flies down and tries to grab the sack. Tim and Jen scream and hold the sack. They do not want to share with the crow. The crow is angry and noisy. It pecks and flaps and caws.
Tim and Jen are scared and sad. They do not like the crow. They want it to go away. They look for help. They see a man with a dog. The man is a park ranger. The dog is a friendly. They bark and run to the tree. They scare the crow. The crow flies away.
Tim and Jen are happy and relieved. They thank the man and the dog. They give them some juice and cookies. They share and smile. They finish their rest and pack their sack. They are ready to play again. They have fun.
