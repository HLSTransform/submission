Once upon a time, there was a little birdie. The birdie had a nest on a tree. One day, the birdie saw a big, black cat. The birdie was scared and wanted to hurry back to the nest. 
The birdie flew fast and reached the nest quickly. The nest was made of wire and was very cozy. The birdie felt safe and healthy in the nest. 
From that day on, the birdie was always careful and made sure to hurry back to the nest before dark. The birdie knew that the nest was the safest place to be.
