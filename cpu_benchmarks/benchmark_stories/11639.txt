Once upon a time, there was a kind little girl named Sarah. She wanted to help people and make a difference. One day she took her polishing cloth and walked to her Grandma's house.
When Sarah arrived at Grandma's house, she heard loud singing coming from the kitchen. Grandma was polishing her foot! Grandma saw Sarah and said, "Hello Sarah! I'm so happy you came to visit. I was just polishing my foot and singing so loud. Would you like to help me?"
Sarah smiled and said, "Yes, I'd love to help!"
So Sarah took the polishing cloth and started to help Grandma polish her foot. They sang and polished together, Grandma's voice getting louder and louder. When they were finished, Grandma smiled and said, "Thanks Sarah! Now my foot is so shiny and clean!"
Sarah smiled and hugged Grandma. "It was fun helping you polish your foot and singing like that. I'll come back soon!"
And so Sarah went back home, feeling happy that she had been able to help Grandma and make her day a bit brighter.
