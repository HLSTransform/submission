Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved strawberries because they tasted so yummy. One day, she went to the garden to pick some strawberries. She found a big, juicy strawberry and picked it. But when she took a bite, it was sour! Lily was sad because she wanted a sweet strawberry.
Suddenly, a gust of wind blew and she lost her balance. She fell down and the strawberry flew out of her hand. She cried because she was hurt and her strawberry was gone. But then, she saw a kind old man who helped her up and gave her a sweet strawberry. Lily was happy again and thanked the kind old man.
