Once upon a time, there was a little worm named Wiggly. Wiggly was a perfect worm, but he felt sad because he had no friends. He lived in a big garden with lots of plants and dirt.
One day, Wiggly met a little girl named Lily. Lily looked at Wiggly and said, "Hi, worm! Do you want to be my friend?" Wiggly felt very happy and said, "Yes, I want to be your friend!" Lily and Wiggly played together in the garden, and they had lots of fun.
But one day, a big bird came to the garden. The bird looked at Wiggly and said, "I want to eat you, worm!" Wiggly felt scared and called for help. Lily heard Wiggly and came running. She picked up Wiggly and said, "No, bird! You can't eat my friend!" The bird flew away, and Wiggly felt safe again. From that day on, Wiggly and Lily were the best of friends.
