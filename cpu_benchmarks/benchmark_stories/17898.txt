Once upon a time, there was an old man who was very wise. He had a walking cane that he would take with him every day. One day, as he was walking, something struck him on the shoulder. He was surprised and looked around to see what had happened.
He saw a small boy standing there, holding a stick. The boy was giggling and pointing to the old man's cane. The old man smiled and said, "That's a very wise cane, isn't it? Where did you find it?"
The little boy grinned and said, "I made it! I was playing with bits of sticks and I thought I'd try to make something like your cane." 
The old man was impressed and he reached out his hand to the little boy "Thank you for that clever cane. I will take it with me from now on." 
The old man waved goodbye to the little boy and went on his way, eagerly tapping his newfound cane on the ground as he went.
