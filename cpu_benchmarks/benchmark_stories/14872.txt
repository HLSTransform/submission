Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Benny. Benny was very happy because he loved to bounce around in the meadow. One day, Benny saw a beautiful butterfly flying gracefully in the sky. 
Benny said, "Hello, Mr. Butterfly! Can you teach me how to fly like you?" 
The butterfly replied, "Oh, Benny, I cannot teach you how to fly, but I can teach you how to be graceful." 
The butterfly showed Benny how to brush his fur and how to hop with grace. Benny practiced and practiced until he became very graceful. Now, he could bounce around the meadow with grace just like the butterfly. Benny was very happy and thanked the butterfly for his help.
