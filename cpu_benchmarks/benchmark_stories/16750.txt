Tim and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to dig and find bugs and stones. They saw a big bottle under a bush. It was green and had a skull on it.
"Look, what is this?" Tim asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it is juice," Lily said.
They opened the bottle and smelled it. It was bad. It made them cough.
"Yuck, this is not juice. This is poison," Tim said.
"Poison? What is poison?" Lily asked.
"Poison is something that makes you sick. Very sick. You should not drink it or touch it," Tim said.
"Who put it here?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe someone bad. Or someone who forgot. We should tell mom," Tim said.
They closed the bottle and ran to the house. They found mom in the kitchen.
"Mom, mom, we found poison in the garden. It was under a bush. It was green and had a skull on it," Tim said.
"Poison? In the garden? Show me," mom said.
She followed them to the bush. She saw the bottle and gasped.
"Oh no, this is very dangerous. This is not normal. This is weed killer. It kills plants and bugs and can hurt people too. How did you find it?" mom asked.
"We were playing and digging and we saw it. We opened it and smelled it. It was bad. We did not drink it or touch it," Tim said.
"Good, good. I'm glad you did not drink it or touch it. You are very smart and brave. This is not for children. This is for adults. And only for some plants. Not for all plants. And not for the garden. This is a mistake. Someone must have left it here by accident. I will call them and tell them to take it away. And I will check the garden for more poison. You come with me. We will stay away from the poison. And we will wash our hands and faces. And we will have some juice. Some real juice. Not poison. OK?" mom said.
"OK, mom. We are sorry. We did not know. We will not touch poison again. We love you," Tim and Lily said.
They hugged mom and went with her. They washed their hands and faces. They had some juice. Some real juice. Not poison. They were happy. They were safe. They were normal.
