Sam and Mia were at the beach with their mom and dad. They liked to play in the sand and splash in the water. They saw many things in the sea, like fish and crabs and shells.
"Look, Mia, a jellyfish!" Sam said, pointing to a shiny blob on the shore. "It is amazing! It is like a balloon with strings."
Mia ran over to see the jellyfish. She wanted to touch it and see how it felt. "Can I touch it, Sam?" she asked.
Sam shook his head. "No, Mia, you can't. Mom and dad said jellyfish can hurt you. They can sting you with their strings and make you cry."
Mia did not listen to Sam. She thought he was just being mean and bossy. She reached out her hand to touch the jellyfish. "It won't hurt me, Sam. It is just a jellyfish. It is amazing."
But as soon as she touched the jellyfish, she felt a sharp pain in her finger. She screamed and pulled her hand back. The jellyfish had stung her. It was not amazing. It was bad.
Sam ran to get mom and dad. They came quickly and saw Mia crying and holding her finger. They saw the jellyfish on the sand. They knew what had happened.
"Mia, why did you touch the jellyfish?" mom asked. "We told you not to. They are dangerous. You could have been very sick."
Mia sobbed and said she was sorry. She said she wanted to see the amazing jellyfish. She said Sam tried to stop her, but she did not listen.
Mom and dad hugged Mia and said they loved her. They said they would take her to the doctor and make her feel better. They said they hoped she learned her lesson.
Sam looked at the jellyfish and felt sad. He wished Mia had listened to him. He wished they could have had a fun day at the beach. He wished the jellyfish had not been there. He did not think it was amazing anymore. He thought it was awful.
