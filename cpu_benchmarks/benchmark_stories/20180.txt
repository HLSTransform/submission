One day, Ben and his dad went to the park. Ben saw a big slide that was very high. He wanted to go on it, but he was scared.
"Can I go on the slide, dad?" he asked.
"Sure, Ben. I will help you. It will be fun," his dad said.
They climbed up the stairs to the top of the slide. Ben looked down and felt dizzy. He held his dad's hand tight.
"Ready, Ben?" his dad said.
"No, dad. I don't want to go. It's too high. I want to go down," Ben said.
"It's okay, Ben. You can do it. I will go with you. Trust me," his dad said.
But Ben did not want to go. He started to weep. He wept loud and hard. He did not want to slide.
Some other kids were waiting to go on the slide. They saw Ben weeping and laughed at him.
"Look at him. He's a baby. He's scared of the slide. Ha ha ha," they said.
Ben heard them and felt sad. He wept more.
"Stop it. Don't be mean. He's just a little boy. He can go when he's ready," his dad said to the other kids.
He hugged Ben and said, "Don't worry, Ben. You don't have to go on the slide if you don't want to. We can do something else. How about we go and play with the pipe?"
Ben looked up and saw a big pipe on the ground. It was long and round and had holes in it. His dad showed him how to blow into the holes and make sounds.
"Wow, dad. That's cool. Can I try?" Ben said.
"Sure, Ben. Here you go. You can make music with the pipe," his dad said.
Ben took the pipe and blew into the holes. He made different sounds. He liked the pipe. He smiled and stopped weeping.
"Thank you, dad. You're the best. I love you," he said.
"I love you too, Ben. You're my brave boy. Maybe next time you can try the slide. But only if you want to," his dad said.
They played with the pipe and had fun. They forgot about the slide and the mean kids. They were happy.
