Sara and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. Sara had a soft doll that she liked to hug and dress up. Ben had a toy car that he liked to zoom and crash. They were having fun, but sometimes they got bored.
"Let's play something else," Ben said. "Let's play doctor and patient."
"OK," Sara said. "You be the doctor and I be the patient."
Ben put on a white coat and a stethoscope. He pretended to check Sara's ears and nose and throat. He said, "Hmm, you are very sick. You need a stitch."
"A stitch?" Sara asked. "What is that?"
"A stitch is when the doctor pokes you with a needle and a thread to close a cut," Ben said. "It hurts a little, but it makes you better."
Sara did not like the sound of that. She did not want to be poked with a needle. She felt troubled. She said, "No, thank you. I don't need a stitch. I'm not that sick."
"Yes, you are," Ben said. "You have a big cut on your arm. Look."
Ben pointed to a small scratch on Sara's arm. It was from the cat. It did not hurt or bleed. Sara said, "That's not a cut. That's a scratch. It's fine."
"No, it's not," Ben said. "It's a cut. And it needs a stitch. Now hold still."
Ben took a needle and a thread from his mom's sewing box. He tried to poke Sara's arm with the needle. Sara screamed and pushed him away. She said, "Stop it! That's not a game. That's mean. You're hurting me."
Ben dropped the needle and the thread. He looked surprised and sorry. He said, "I'm sorry, Sara. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to play."
Sara was crying and rubbing her arm. She said, "I don't want to play with you anymore. You're a bad doctor. Go away."
Ben felt sad and ashamed. He said, "I'm sorry, Sara. Please don't be mad at me. I won't poke you again. Can we still be friends?"
Sara sniffed and looked at him. She saw that he was sorry. She said, "OK, Ben. I forgive you. But don't ever do that again. And don't touch my doll."
Ben nodded and said, "OK, Sara. I won't. And I'm sorry about your doll."
He picked up his toy car and said, "Let's play something else. Let's play race."
Sara smiled and said, "OK, Ben. Let's play race. But you have to let me win sometimes."
They hugged and made up. They played race with their toys. They had fun again. They were friends again.
