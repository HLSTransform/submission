Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a blue dress and loved to play outside in the wild. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friend, Timmy. 
"Hi, Timmy!" said Lily. 
"Hi, Lily!" said Timmy. 
"I missed you," said Lily. 
"I missed you too," said Timmy. 
They played on the swings and the slide. They ran around in the grass and chased each other. They had so much fun together. 
When it was time to go home, Lily said, "I don't want to leave. I'll miss you, Timmy." 
"Don't worry, Lily," said Timmy. "We'll play again soon." 
Lily smiled and said, "Okay, I'll see you later, alligator!" 
"Goodbye, Lily," said Timmy. 
And with that, Lily went home, feeling happy and excited to play with Timmy again.
