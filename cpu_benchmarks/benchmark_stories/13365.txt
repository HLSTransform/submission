Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. He loved to ride his motorbike around the park. One day, Timmy's mom told him he couldn't ride his motorbike because it was too dangerous.
Timmy was sad because he loved his motorbike. He asked his mom if she would allow him to ride it just once. But his mom was serious and said no.
Timmy was so upset that he went to his room and cried. But then he had an idea. He could ask his dad to help him build a safer motorbike. So, he went to his dad and together they built a new motorbike that was safe for Timmy to ride. Timmy's mom was happy to see that Timmy was riding a safe motorbike and allowed him to ride it in the park. Timmy was happy again and rode his motorbike with joy. The end.
