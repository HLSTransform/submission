Once upon a time there was a farm. It had lots of animals and a big field. One day a sheep was jumping in the field. It was having lots of fun. 
Suddenly, a fox jumped out from behind a bush. The sheep was very scared. It started to run away, but it couldn't jump as high as the fox. 
Luckily, the farmer was nearby. He rushed over and shouted at the fox. The fox was very scared and ran away. 
The sheep was glad that the farmer was so brave. It thanked him and they both jumped into the air, celebrating the fox's departure. 
The sheep never had to be scared again. The farmer was always there to keep it safe. The end.
