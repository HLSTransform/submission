One day, a small girl named Lucy was playing outside. She noticed something strange in the sky. It was a long finger coming down from the clouds. 
"What is that, Mommy?" asked Lucy excitedly.
"It's just a cloud, sweetheart," her mother replied.
But Lucy knew it was something more. She stared as the long finger got closer and closer. Suddenly, the finger began to move. Lucy couldn't believe it.
"Look, Mommy!" exclaimed Lucy. "The finger is waving at me!"
"I see it," said her mother with a smile.
"Let's wave back!" Lucy said excitedly.
So the two of them waved to the long finger in the sky. Lucy felt a sense of joy and wonder, feeling connected to the special thing she noticed in the sky.
