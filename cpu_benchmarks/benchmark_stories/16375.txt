Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She loved ice cream. One hot day, she went to the ice cream shop with her mom. Sally wanted her ice cream in a special order. First, she wanted chocolate, then vanilla, and lastly, strawberry on top.
Sally's mom said, "Remember, if you don't eat your ice cream fast, it will melt." Sally nodded and started eating her ice cream. But then, she saw a lemon tree. She picked a lemon and took a bite. "Yuck!" Sally said, "This is so sour!" She didn't like the taste at all.
While Sally was busy eating the sour lemon, her ice cream started to melt. She looked at her ice cream and saw that it was all melted. Sally was sad, but she learned a lesson. Next time, she would listen to her mom and not get distracted by sour things. This way, she could enjoy her ice cream in the right order.
