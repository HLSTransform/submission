Tom was a gifted boy who liked to draw and read. He had many books and pencils in his room. One day, he wanted to make a picture for his mom, who was at work. He took a big paper and some colors and started to draw.
He drew a house, a tree, a sun, and a car. He was very happy with his picture. He wanted to write "I love you, Mom" on it, but he did not know how. He only knew some letters, but not all. He tried to copy them from his books, but they looked different. He got angry and sad. He threw his pencil and frown.
"What are you doing, Tom?" his dad asked. He came to his room and saw the paper and the pencil on the floor. He picked them up and looked at the picture. He smiled and hugged Tom. "This is a beautiful picture, Tom. I'm sure your mom will love it. Do you want me to help you write something on it?"
Tom nodded and wiped his tears. He gave his dad the paper and the pencil. His dad wrote "I love you, Mom" in big letters. He also wrote "From Tom, your gifted son" in small letters. He gave the paper back to Tom and said, "There you go, Tom. Now you have a nice gift for your mom. Do you want to put it in an envelope?"
Tom nodded again and smiled. He and his dad went to the kitchen and found an envelope. They put the paper inside and sealed it. Tom wrote "Mom" on the front. He also drew a heart and a smiley face. He was very proud of his gift.
He asked his dad, "Can we give it to Mom when she comes home?"
"Of course, Tom. She will be very happy to see it. But first, do you want some milk and cookies?"
Tom nodded and said, "Yes, please, Dad. Can I have a teaspoon of sugar in my milk?"
"Sure, Tom. You can have a teaspoon of sugar in your milk. You are a very good boy, Tom. I love you."
"I love you too, Dad." Tom said. He and his dad had some milk and cookies and waited for Mom to come home.
