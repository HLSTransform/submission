Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. He lived in a house with his mommy and daddy. Tom was very eager to play outside, but his mommy told him to finish his lunch first. 
Tom's neighbor, Mrs. Smith, saw him eating and said, "Hello, Tom! What are you eating for lunch?" 
Tom replied, "I'm eating a sandwich with peanut butter and jelly. It's yummy!" 
Mrs. Smith smiled and said, "That sounds delicious. Don't forget to wash your hands when you're done eating." 
Tom finished his lunch and ran outside to play. He had so much fun that he forgot to come inside when his mommy called him for dinner. But his neighbor, Mrs. Smith, saw him playing and reminded him to go inside for dinner. Tom thanked her and went inside to eat with his family.
