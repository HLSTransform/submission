Lola was very excited. It was her birthday and she was having a party. She ran around the house calling out to her parents to come and join her.
"Mommy! Daddy! My birthday party is starting soon!" Lola shouted.
Her mommy came into the room and said, "That's great, Lola. But don't forget, you still have to study before the party. It's very hot today, so let's study in the garden." 
Lola happily agreed and sat outside in the garden. She opened up her school-book and began to study. She read and wrote until it was time for her birthday party to start.
With a big smile and a hug from her mommy and daddy, Lola celebrated her birthday.
