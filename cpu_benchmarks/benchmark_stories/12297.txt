Once there was a little girl called Mari who lived with her mom in a cozy house. She was very cheerful and often played in her garden. One day, there was a sound coming from the garden and Mari went to investigate.
When she got there, Mari saw a little puddle of water! She came closer and saw that it was a leak from the side of the house. She ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, there's a leak in the garden!"
Mari's mom went outside with her and saw that there was a leak from the water pipe in the wall. She was not worried, however, and said, "Let's fix this! It will be a fun task!"
Mari and her mom went to the store to buy a little tool to fix the leak. Mari was so happy and cheerful to have a task with her mom. After they bought the tool, they went home to fix the leak.
It took Mari and her mom a few tries to fix the leak, but after a while the leak was fixed! Mari was so proud of herself and cheerfully said, "Mom, I fixed the leak!" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, you did! Great job!"
