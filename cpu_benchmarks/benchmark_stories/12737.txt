Once upon a time there was a little girl called Amy. She found a mysterious room one day and wanted to explore it. She opened the door and saw a dusty old table with some strange looking books on it. She picked up the book on the top and suddenly the room filled with a golden light.
Amy was amazed and wondered what was going on. Suddenly an old man appeared, who said to her, "Welcome! I'm the keeper of this room and I have a special task for you."
The old man told Amy that she had to find the memory wiping cloth and use it to wipe away a special kind of memory.
Amy nodded her head, not knowing what he meant. So the old man explained, “This cloth will erase the most mysterious memories from people’s minds. You must find the cloth and use it, if you are brave enough."
Amy agreed and set out to find the cloth. After a while, she finally found it. She wiped away all the mysterious memories and went back to the old room, feeling proud of herself.
The old man thanked her and said, “This was a big task, but you have done it - thank you!”
And so Amy said goodbye to the old man and returned home, feeling happy that she had solved the mystery.
