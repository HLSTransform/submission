Lisa and Tom are friends. They like to play and share. Today is Lisa's birthday. She has a big cake with candles. She is happy.
Tom comes to her party. He brings a gift. He says, "Happy birthday, Lisa! I have a gift for you. Can I have some cake?" Lisa says, "Thank you, Tom! You are very nice. Yes, you can have some cake. But first, let's play a game."
Lisa is very organized. She has a game for her friends. She says, "We will act like animals. I will say an animal, and you will act like it. Whoever acts the best, wins a prize. Are you ready?" Her friends say, "Yes, yes, we are ready!"
Lisa says, "The first animal is a lion. Roar like a lion!" Her friends roar. Tom roars the loudest. He acts like a big lion. He jumps and runs. He is having fun.
But Tom is not careful. He bumps into the table. The cake falls on the floor. The candles go out. The cake is ruined. Lisa is sad. She cries. She says, "Tom, you are very bad! You ruined my cake! You ruined my party! Go away!"
Tom is sorry. He says, "I'm sorry, Lisa. I didn't mean to. I was just acting like a lion. Please don't be mad at me. Please forgive me." But Lisa is too sad. She doesn't listen to Tom. She doesn't want to be his friend anymore. She tells him to leave.
Tom leaves. He is sad too. He walks home alone. He wishes he could have some cake. He wishes he could have Lisa as his friend. He wishes he could say sorry again. But it is too late. He acted very bad. He lost his friend. He lost his cake. He lost his fun. He has nothing. The end.
