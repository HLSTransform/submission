The little boy was learning new things. He had a teacher who was helping him. On the day that the teacher came, he brought the little boy something new to learn. 
The little boy sat in a chair and listened to the teacher. The teacher said, “Today I'm going to teach you how to clap your hands.” 
The little boy smiled and said, “Yes, I want to learn that.”
The teacher clapped his hands and the little boy imitated him. The teacher clapped one hand then the other. The little boy followed and clapped his hands too. 
The teacher was very happy. So he clapped even more. He was clapping so hard his cheeks were turning pale. The little boy laughed and clapped with him. 
They clapped together until the sun started to set. The teacher said, “We did a good job today. Now you know how to clap your hands.” 
The little boy smiled and said, “Yes, I did!” And the two of them clapped one last time.
