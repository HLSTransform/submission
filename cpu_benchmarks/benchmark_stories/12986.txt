Once upon a time there was a cop who could take incredible leaps. He had long legs and he could jump really high. One day, a little girl named Daisy was playing hopscotch on the playground and she spotted the cop. 
She said, "Hello! You can jump so high. Are you a superhero?"
The cop smiled and said, "No, I'm just a cop with some special skill." 
Daisy was so impressed. She said, "That's incredible! Can you show me how high you can jump?"
The cop laughed and said, "Yes, of course." He then took an incredible leap, crossing the playground with two big jumps. 
Daisy's eyes were wide. She said, "Wow, look at you go! You must be the best cop in the city."
The cop smiled. He said, "Thank you, Daisy. You are very kind." 
And they both smiled, because they both knew it was true.
