Once there was an uncle. He was very kind. He loved to give hugs and play games.
One day, the uncle invited some children to come play in his backyard. The children had a lot of fun playing tag and hide and seek. They laughed and played until it began to get dark outside. 
Finally, it was time to end the day. "Goodbye everyone!" the uncle said. The children hugged him and said goodbye with big smiles.
They thanked him for being so kind. Then they all waved to each other and said goodbye one last time before going home. It was a great day that ended happily.
