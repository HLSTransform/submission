Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to have fun and go on adventures. One day, she went on an adventurous walk in the forest with her mommy. They saw many birds and squirrels and even a little bunny. 
When they got home, Lily's mommy poured her a glass of juice. Lily loved to pour her own juice, but sometimes she spilled it. Today, she was very careful and didn't spill a drop! She felt proud of herself and had even more fun drinking her juice. 
Afterwards, Lily and her mommy played a fun game of hide-and-seek. Lily loved to hide in adventurous places like behind the curtains or under the bed. Her mommy always found her and they laughed and giggled together. It was a very fun day for Lily and she went to bed with a big smile on her face.
