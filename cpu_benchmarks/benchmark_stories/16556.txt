Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside in the park. Today it is cold, so they wear coats. Tom has a red coat and Mia has a blue coat.
They run and jump and slide on the grass. They have fun. But then Tom sees a big dog. He is scared of dogs. He runs away from the dog. He does not see where he is going. He runs into a tree. His coat gets stuck on a branch. He tries to pull his coat, but it does not come off. He starts to cry.
Mia hears Tom cry. She runs to him. She sees his coat on the tree. She is sad for Tom. She tries to help him. She climbs the tree. She reaches for his coat. She pulls his coat, but it is too hard. She loses her balance. She falls from the tree. Her coat falls with her. She lands on the ground. She hurts her knee. She starts to cry too.
Now Tom and Mia are both crying. They have no coats. They are cold and hurt. They want to go home. They want their moms. They want their normal coats. They are not happy. They are not friends. They are mad at each other. They blame each other for losing their coats. They say mean words. They do not play anymore. They sit on the ground and cry.
