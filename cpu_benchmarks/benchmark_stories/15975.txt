Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to go on tours with his mommy and daddy. One day, they went on a tour to the zoo. Timmy was so happy to see all the animals like the little monkeys and the big elephants.
While they were walking around, Timmy saw a little girl who was crying. He went up to her and asked her why she was crying. She said that she lost her mommy and daddy. Timmy knew what it felt like to be lost, so he spoke to her and told her that he would help her find her parents.
They walked around the zoo together, looking for her parents. Finally, they found them near the lion's cage. The little girl was so happy to see her mommy and daddy again. They thanked Timmy for helping their little girl and gave him a big hug.
The moral of the story is that it's important to help others when they are in need, even if they are little like Timmy.
