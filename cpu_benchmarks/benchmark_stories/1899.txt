Once there was a strong igloo. It was built by some polar bears and they were very proud of it.
One day a fox was walking around and he saw the igloo. He wanted to see how strong it was, so he decided to cut it with a sharp knife.
He started cutting the igloo but it was too strong for him. A polar bear who had seen the fox cutting came over to him and said:
"Why are you cutting my igloo?"
The fox said he wanted to see how strong it was.
The bear then said,"No cutting! This igloo is a very good home for me and my friends. Leave it alone!"
The fox agreed and he ran away.
The polar bears were very happy because the igloo was still strong. They thanked the bear who had saved their igloo. From then on they kept it even stronger.
