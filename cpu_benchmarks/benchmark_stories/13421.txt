Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a mop that she loved to play with. One day, Lily's mom gifted her a big box of chocolates. Lily was so happy and excited to eat them all.
But then, she had to decide whether to eat them all by herself or share them with her friends. Lily decided to eat them all by herself, because she wanted to keep them all for herself.
However, Lily ate too much chocolate and got very sick. She had to go to the hospital and couldn't play with her mop anymore. From then on, Lily learned that sharing is important and that being gifted with something special also means being responsible with it.
