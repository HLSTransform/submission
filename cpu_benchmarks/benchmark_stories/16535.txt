Once upon a time, there was a clever wolf. He lived in a forest and liked to play with his friends. One day, he decided to decorate his den. He asked his friends to help him find pretty things to put inside. They found flowers, leaves, and shiny rocks.
The wolf was very happy with his new den. He felt very intelligent for thinking of such a good idea. But one day, a hunter came into the forest. The wolf didn't know that the hunter was dangerous. The hunter saw the wolf's den and decided to catch him.
The wolf tried to run away, but the hunter was too fast. The hunter caught the wolf and took him away. The wolf's friends were very sad. They missed their clever friend who had decorated his den so nicely.
