Once upon a time there was a turkey who was very hungry. He looked all around, hoping to find something to eat. Suddenly, he spied an apple tree and he decided to try to get some apples from it. He tiptoed up to the tree and looked up. He wanted to see if he could reach an apple on a branch. But the apples were far away, and the turkey was too small.
He shook his head sadly and sat down. With a big sigh, he said," I dare not reach the apples." As if in answer, he heard a familiar sound. It was a rooster crowing in the distance. The turkey thought, maybe I can ask this rooster if he can help me.
So the turkey walked to the rooster and said, "Rooster, I am really hungry. Would you please help me get the apples from the apple tree?" The rooster smiled and said, "Yes, of course I will help. I am brave and strong, I can surely get you the apples!"
So the rooster spread his wings wide and flew up to the tree. He plucked the apples with his beak and then flew back down to the ground. The turkey was so happy. He thanked the rooster and quickly gobbled up the apples. Now the turkey was full and happy and forever grateful to his brave rooster friend.
