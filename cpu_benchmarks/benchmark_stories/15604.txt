Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play with toys. Tom has a car and Sue has a doll. They share their toys and have fun.
One day, Tom finds a pencil. It is yellow and has a sharp point. Tom thinks it is a cool toy. He wants to draw with it. He says, "This is mine. I found it. It is a magic pencil."
Sue is curious. She wants to see the pencil. She says, "Can I look at it? Please, Tom. It is not a toy. It is for writing. You can hurt yourself with the sharp point."
Tom does not listen. He says, "No, it is mine. Go away. I will draw a big car with it." He starts to draw on the wall. He makes a loud noise.
Sue is sad. She thinks Tom is silly. She says, "Tom, stop. You are making a mess. Mom and Dad will be angry. The wall is not for drawing. The pencil is not for playing. You are being silly."
Tom does not stop. He draws more and more. He is happy. He thinks he is making a beautiful car. He says, "Look, Sue. Look at my car. It is the best car ever. It is mine."
Sue shakes her head. She says, "Tom, that is not a car. That is a scribble. It is ugly. It is not yours. It is Mom and Dad's wall. You are being very silly."
Tom looks at the wall. He sees the scribble. He sees the pencil. He sees Sue. He feels bad. He says, "Oh, Sue. You are right. I am sorry. I was silly. I did not mean to make a mess. I did not mean to hurt the wall. I did not mean to hurt you."
Sue smiles. She says, "It is okay, Tom. I forgive you. We can clean the wall together. We can use a cloth and some water. We can put the pencil away. It is not a toy. It is for writing. We can write our names with it. We can share it."
Tom nods. He says, "Thank you, Sue. You are a good friend. I am sorry I was silly. I will share with you. I will be careful with the sharp point. I will not draw on the wall again."
They hug. They clean the wall. They write their names with the pencil. They play with their toys. They are happy. They are friends.
