Once upon a time there was a little girl. She loved to bounce around. One day she went into a big old cave. Inside she saw something special. It was a rare diamond! It was sparkling and shone so brightly.
The girl wanted to take the diamond home with her. But it kept bouncing away! She chased the diamond around and around the cave. 
Finally she managed to catch hold of the diamond. She put it carefully in her pocket. She was so happy to have found such a rare and beautiful thing. 
From that day onwards, the girl always went on bouncing adventures to find new and magical things.
