Johny was at the park with his mum and dad. He saw two birds on a branch in a tree and he pointed at them. 
"Look at the birds, mummy. What are they?" He asked excitedly. 
Mummy paused and looked at them closely. "I'm not sure, that's an unusual colour."
Johny walked over to the tree and looked closer. He noticed one of the birds had a very big nose. 
Johny's dad chuckled. "I think that's a toucan. It has a very unusual beak." 
Johny smiled. He liked the bird's big beak and was happy he knew the answer. He waved goodbye to the birds and ran off to find more exciting things.
