Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mommy and daddy. They brought a big bottle of sauce for their picnic lunch. Lily loved sauce, especially the thick kind that was her favorite.
As they were eating, Lily saw a big puddle of water nearby. She wanted to jump in it and splash around, but her mommy said no. "You'll get all wet and dirty," she said. Lily was sad, but she listened to her mommy.
After lunch, they went for a walk around the park. Lily saw a fountain in the distance and got excited. "Can we go there?" she asked her daddy. He said yes, and they walked over to the fountain.
When they got there, Lily saw that the water was spraying up high into the air. She knew what she wanted to do. She ran over to the fountain and jumped right in, splashing water everywhere. Her mommy and daddy laughed and joined in too.
As they were playing, Lily's daddy accidentally knocked over the bottle of sauce. It spilled all over the ground, making a big mess. But Lily didn't mind. She was having too much fun splashing in the fountain. And after all, she still had her favorite thick sauce to eat for lunch.
