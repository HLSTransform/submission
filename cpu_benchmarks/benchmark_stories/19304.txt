Once, there was a humble man who lived alone in a small house. Every day he offered his help to anyone who needed it.
One day, the man encountered a small group of kids that were going to the movies but couldn't afford the tickets. Seeing how they were all so sad, the man kindly offered to take them to the movie. 
The kids were overjoyed and thanked him for his generosity and kindness.
As the man watched the kids eagerly enter the movie house, he smiled and thought to himself what a simple, yet rewarding experience it was to help these humble children.
