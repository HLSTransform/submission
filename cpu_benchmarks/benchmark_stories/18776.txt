Lily was a brave girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had a big doll named Anna who was her best friend. Anna had a hole in her arm where the stuffing came out. Lily wanted to fix Anna, but she did not know how.
One day, Lily saw her mom sewing a button on her shirt. She thought that maybe her mom could sew Anna's arm too. She ran to her room and got Anna. She brought her to her mom and said, "Mom, can you help Anna? She has a hole and needs an operation."
Her mom looked at Anna and smiled. She said, "Of course, I can help Anna. But first, we need to wash her. She is very dirty from playing outside. We don't want to prevent her from getting better by putting germs in her hole."
Lily nodded and followed her mom to the bathroom. They filled the sink with warm water and soap. They gently washed Anna's face, hair, body, and arm. They rinsed her and wrapped her in a towel. They took her to the living room and put her on the couch.
Her mom got a needle and some thread. She carefully sewed Anna's hole closed. She tied a knot and cut the thread. She gave Anna a kiss and said, "There, Anna is all fixed. She had a successful operation. She will feel much better now."
Lily hugged Anna and thanked her mom. She said, "You are the best mom ever. And you are the best doctor too. Anna and I love you very much." She kissed her mom and Anna. She took Anna to her room and played with her. She was very happy.
