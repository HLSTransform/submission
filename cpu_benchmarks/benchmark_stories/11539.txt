One day, a little boy named Sam went to the park. He saw a big, smooth hoop on the ground. He picked it up and started to play. He rolled the hoop and watched it go round and round. Sam was very happy.
A girl named Lily came over and asked, "Can I play with the hoop too?" Sam thought for a moment and said, "Yes, you can play with me." They took turns rolling the hoop and had a lot of fun together.
After a while, it was time to go home. Sam and Lily put the hoop back on the ground. They learned that sharing and playing together made them both happy. The moral of the story is that sharing with others can bring joy and friendship.
