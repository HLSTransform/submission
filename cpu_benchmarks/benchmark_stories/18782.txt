Lily was a humble girl who liked to help others. She had a soft voice and a kind heart. One day, she saw a big dog chasing a small cat in the park. The cat was scared and ran up a tree. The dog barked and jumped, but could not reach the cat.
Lily wanted to prevent the dog from hurting the cat. She ran to the dog and said, "Stop, dog! You are not nice. The cat is not your toy. Leave the cat alone." The dog looked at Lily and stopped barking. He wagged his tail and licked her hand. He was not a bad dog, just a playful one.
Lily smiled and petted the dog. She said, "Good dog. You are a friend, not a bully. Come, let's go find your owner." She took the dog's collar and walked with him. The cat saw them and came down from the tree. She meowed and rubbed against Lily's leg. She said, "Thank you, girl. You are brave and gentle. You saved me from the dog."
Lily hugged the cat and the dog. She said, "You are welcome, cat. You are cute and fluffy. I'm glad you are safe." She found the dog's owner and told him what happened. He thanked Lily and gave her a treat. He said, "You are a humble girl who likes to help others. You have a soft voice and a kind heart. You are a hero." Lily blushed and said, "Thank you, sir. I'm happy to help." She went home with a smile and a new friend.
