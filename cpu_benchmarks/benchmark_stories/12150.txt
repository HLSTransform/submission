Once upon a time, there was a family who all loved spicy food. Their mum always made extra spicy meals every day. 
One day, the mum said, “Let’s eat something extra spicy!” Everyone was so excited!
At first, the food was delicious. But as they ate more and more, the spicy food made them hotter and hotter. It was too much for them! 
The dad said, “This food is too spicy!” But the mum said, “More spicy food will make us all happy.” 
So the family kept eating. But as the spicy food increased, the family could not take it anymore. Finally, they all started crying and couldn’t eat anymore. 
The bad ending meant the family never ate spicy food again.
