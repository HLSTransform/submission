Once upon a time, there was a big castle. In the castle, there were many people who worked there. They were called the staff. They helped the king and queen with everything they needed.
One day, a mysterious package arrived at the castle. Nobody knew where it came from or what was inside. The king and queen asked the staff to open it, but they were too scared. Finally, a brave knight accepted the challenge and opened the package.
Inside the package, there was a beautiful crown. The king and queen were very happy and gave the knight a big reward. From that day on, the knight became part of the staff and helped the king and queen every day.
