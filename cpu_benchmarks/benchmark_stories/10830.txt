Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch videos on her tall TV. One day, Lily's mom told her it was time to shut off the TV and go to bed. 
Lily didn't want to stop watching her video. "But Mommy, can I watch just one more?" she asked. 
Her mom shook her head. "No, Lily. You need to go to bed now." 
Lily felt sad, but she knew her mom was right. She shut off the TV and climbed into bed. As she closed her eyes, she thought about the video she had just watched. 
The next day, Lily woke up feeling happy. She remembered the video from the night before and couldn't wait to watch more. But first, she had to eat breakfast and get dressed. As she put on her shoes, she heard her mom say, "Lily, why don't we go to the park today?" 
Lily's eyes lit up. She loved playing at the park. "Yes, please!" she said. 
As they walked to the park, Lily saw a tall slide. She ran over to it and climbed up. When she got to the top, she remembered the video from the night before. In the video, the character climbed a tall mountain. Lily felt proud that she had climbed a tall slide, just like in the video.
