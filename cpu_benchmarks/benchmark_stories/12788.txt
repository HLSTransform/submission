Once there was a little boy who had a distant dream. He wanted to travel to a country very far away. He told his parents his dream, and they said he should try to make it come true. So he decided to try.
He started planning his trip by saving up his pocket money. He asked his neighbor for advice and he researched the place he wanted to visit. He was really excited, and couldn't wait to go!
But then something bad happened. As he saved up more money, the country he was planning to visit became even more distant. It seemed like it was too far away for him to ever hope to find it. His dream was crushed, and he was very sad.
He tried and tried, but in the end he couldn't travel to that distant country. He had to stay at home and dreamed of what could have been.
