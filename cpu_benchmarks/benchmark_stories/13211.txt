Once upon a time, there was a little puppy. He was so cute and furry. Every day, the puppy liked to go outside and play in the rain. He would get so wet, but he was always so happy.
One day the puppy was so tired that he decided to take a nap. He curled up in a little ball and fell fast asleep. He dreamed of running and playing in the sun. 
When he woke up, the puppy felt so refreshed. The rain had stopped and he had a wonderful nap. He decided it was time to go outside to play again.
The puppy happily ran around in the cool sunshine and played with his friends. It was so nice to be out of the wet rain. The little puppy had been so smart to take a nap and wait for the rain to stop.
