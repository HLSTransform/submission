Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a messy room. The owner of the house, a nice lady, did not like the messy room. She wanted to make it clean and pretty.
One day, the lady had a big idea. She would display her toys and books in the room. She thought it would make the room look nice. She started to clean the messy room and put her toys and books in their places.
After she was done, the room was not messy anymore. The toys and books were on display, and the owner was happy. The room was now clean and pretty, and everyone who came to visit loved it too. And they all lived happily ever after.
