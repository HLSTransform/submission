Once upon a time, there was a farmer who lived on a farm. He had many animals like cows, pigs, and chickens. One day, the farmer saw a wild fox trying to eat his chickens. He wanted to send the fox away, so he took a stick and chased after it. 
The fox was very fast and ran far away from the farm. The farmer was happy that he had sent the fox away. But the fox was very clever and came back in the night when the farmer was sleeping. The fox ate all of the chickens and ran away again. 
The farmer woke up in the morning and saw that all of his chickens were gone. He was very sad and angry. He realized that sending the fox away was not enough. He needed to find a better way to protect his animals. The farmer learned a lesson that day and never forgot it.
