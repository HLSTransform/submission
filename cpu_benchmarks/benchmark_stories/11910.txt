Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her teddy bear. One day, Lily's mommy told her that they were going to visit her grandma. Lily was excited because she loved her grandma very much.
When they arrived at grandma's house, Lily noticed a big present on the table. Her mommy told her that it was a gift for grandma's birthday. Lily wanted to help, so she asked if she could wrap the present. Her mommy agreed and gave her some paper and tape.
Lily worked very hard to wrap the present. She made sure it was smooth and pretty. When she was finished, she was very proud of herself. Later that day, when it was time to go home, Lily realized that she forgot her teddy bear at grandma's house. She was very sad because she loved her teddy bear very much. But her mommy told her not to worry because they would return to grandma's house soon and get her teddy bear back. And they did!
