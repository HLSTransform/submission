Once upon a time, there was a little boy who dreamt of being a bee. He imagined buzzing around gathering sweet nectar with the other bees. Every day, he would fly in his dreams and buzz happily through the flowers.
One day, the boy went for a walk in the garden with his mom. He was amazed at all of the pretty flowers, the buzzing of the bees, and the smell of their sweet nectar. Suddenly, the boy felt his wings sprout from his back and he was able to join the bees in the sky!
He flew and flew, gathering sweet nectar and buzzing with the other bees. It was the most wonderful feeling he had ever experienced. His dream had come true. From then on, the boy flew in his dreams and enjoyed the sweet smell of the nectar every night.
