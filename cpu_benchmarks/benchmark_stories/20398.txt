Once upon a time, there was a little ant who lived in a big garden. One day, the ant saw a big computer on the ground. The ant felt worried because it didn't know what the computer was for. Suddenly, the ant saw a crumb of bread on the keyboard. The ant crawled up to the bread and ate it. 
The ant felt happy because it found food, but it was still worried about the computer. The ant crawled around the computer, trying to figure out what it was. Then, the ant saw a big spider crawling towards the computer too. The ant felt scared and crawled away quickly. 
The spider crawled onto the computer and started typing on the keyboard with its eight legs. The ant watched in amazement as the spider used the computer to find a picture of a fly to eat. The ant realized that the computer was a useful tool and didn't need to be worried anymore.
