Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a kind lawyer. He had a hidden room in his house. In the room, he kept soft toys to comfort sad kids.
One day, a boy named Tim came to the lawyer's house. Tim was very sad. The lawyer took Tim to the hidden room. Tim saw the soft toys and started to feel happy. The lawyer comforted Tim with a big, soft bear.
But then, the lawyer got sick and went away. The hidden room was locked. The kids in the town were sad again. The bad ending made the kids learn to comfort each other. The moral is to always help and comfort your friends when they are sad.
