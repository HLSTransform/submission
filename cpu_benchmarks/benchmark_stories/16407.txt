Lily was a girl who liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls with long hair and pretty dresses. She liked to comb their hair and make them look nice. She did not like to share her dolls with anyone.
One day, she went to visit her aunt, who had a new baby. Lily wanted to see the baby, but she was not very happy when she saw him. The baby was bald! He had no hair at all. Lily thought he looked funny and ugly.
"Look, Lily, this is your cousin Ben. He is very cute and sweet. Do you want to hold him?" her aunt asked.
Lily shook her head. "No, thank you. He is bald. I don't like bald babies. They are not cute. They are weird. I like my dolls better. They have hair."
Her aunt was shocked. She felt sad and angry. She did not like how Lily was rude and mean to her baby. She said, "Lily, that is not a nice thing to say. You should not judge people by how they look. You should be kind and loving to your family. Ben is bald because he is very young. He will grow hair soon. But even if he doesn't, he is still a beautiful and precious baby. He is your cousin and he loves you. You should love him too. Don't you know that hair is not important? What is important is what is inside your heart."
Lily felt ashamed. She realized that she was wrong. She did not know that babies are bald sometimes. She did not know that hair is not important. She did not know that she hurt her aunt and her cousin. She felt sorry and wanted to make up.
She said, "I'm sorry, auntie. I'm sorry, Ben. I was silly and mean. I did not know. I want to hold him. I want to be his friend. I want to love him. Can you forgive me?"
Her aunt smiled and hugged her. She said, "Of course, Lily. I forgive you. I'm glad you learned your lesson. You are a good girl. Come, let me show you how to hold Ben. He likes to cuddle and coo. He is very happy to see you."
Lily held Ben in her arms. She looked at his bald head and smiled. She thought he was cute and sweet. She kissed his cheek and said, "Hello, Ben. I'm your cousin Lily. I love you. You are a beautiful and precious baby. You are my family."
Ben gurgled and reached for her hair. He pulled it gently and laughed. Lily laughed too. She did not mind. She knew he was just playing. She knew he loved her too. She knew that hair is not important. She knew that what is important is what is inside her heart.
