Tommy was happy playing in the garden. He saw a big stone and picked it up. He thought it would be fun to show his mum. He ran inside and said, “Look!”
Mum smiled and said, “That’s a big stone. Well done Tommy!” She gave him a hug.
Suddenly, Tommy heard his dad shout, “Put that stone down now Tommy!” Tommy felt ashamed and put it back in the garden. Dad said, “That stone is special. You can't pick it.”
Tommy said he was sorry and dad gave him a hug. He said it was ok, but Tommy must never pick the stone again. Tommy nodded, looked down and smiled.
