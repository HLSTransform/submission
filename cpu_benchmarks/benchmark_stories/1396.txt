Once upon a time there was a boy called Ted. Ted loved to catch things! One day his mum took him on a visit to a farm. Ted was so excited!
At the farm Ted saw lots of animals. There were chickens and cows and even rabbits. Ted spotted a harmless white rabbit, so he decided to try and catch it. He crept up quietly and tried to grab it, but it was too quick for him!
He was so disappointed. Suddenly, he heard a noise. It was coming from the barn. Ted ran over and looked inside. There, sitting in the middle of the barn, was a big, harmless dog! It was looking at Ted with its big brown eyes.
Ted thought the dog was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. So he decided to catch it! He carefully crept closer and then grabbed it around the neck. The dog didn't mind, it just wagged its tail.
Ted and the dog were friends ever since! They would visit the farm often and Ted would take the dog for walks. It was the greatest visit Ted had ever made!
