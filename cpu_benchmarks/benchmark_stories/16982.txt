Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in their house. They have a big hall with a long rug. The rug is soft and smooth. They like to slide on the rug.
One day, they hear a knock on the door. They run to the door and see their friend Sam. Sam has a big smile and a red ball. He says, "Hi, Lily and Ben. Can I play with you?"
Lily and Ben say, "Yes, Sam. Come in. We are sliding on the rug. It is fun."
Sam comes in and sees the hall and the rug. He says, "Wow, that looks cool. Can I try?"
Lily and Ben say, "Sure, Sam. But be careful. Don't slide too fast or you will hit the wall."
Sam says, "OK, I will be careful." He puts his ball on the floor and runs to the rug. He slides on the rug with Lily and Ben. They laugh and giggle. They have a lot of fun.
They slide on the rug until they are tired. Then they sit on the floor and play with the ball. They toss the ball to each other and catch it. They are happy.
They hear a voice from the kitchen. It is their mom. She says, "Lily, Ben, Sam, it is time for a snack. Come to the kitchen. I have cookies and milk for you."
Lily, Ben, and Sam say, "Yay, cookies and milk!" They get up and run to the kitchen. They leave the door open. They love cookies and milk. They love their mom. They love their friend. They are happy.
