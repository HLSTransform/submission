Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tweetie. Tweetie loved to fly high in the sky and sing sweet songs. One day, while flying, Tweetie saw a big, sour lemon on a tree. Tweetie wanted to taste it but didn't know how to get it.
Tweetie flew around the tree, looking for a way to reach the lemon. Suddenly, Tweetie saw a secret passage through the leaves. Tweetie flew through the passage and reached the lemon. But just as Tweetie was about to take a bite, a big, mean cat appeared.
The cat wanted the lemon too and started chasing Tweetie. Tweetie flew as fast as possible, with the cat hot on its tail. Finally, Tweetie reached its nest and hid the lemon safely. The cat couldn't find it and went away. Tweetie was happy to have saved the lemon and felt proud of its flying skills.
