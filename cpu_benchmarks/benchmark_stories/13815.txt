Lila and Sam were playing in the yard. They liked to move around and make noises. They pretended to be animals and cars and planes. They had a lot of fun.
But then, a mosquito came. It was a regular mosquito, with a long nose and wings. It wanted to bite Lila and Sam. It flew near their ears and made a buzz sound.
"Go away, mosquito!" Lila said. She waved her hand at the mosquito. "You are not nice. You hurt us."
"Shoo, shoo, mosquito!" Sam said. He blew at the mosquito. "You are not fun. You bother us."
But the mosquito did not listen. It kept flying and buzzing. It tried to land on Lila and Sam. It was hungry and mean.
Lila and Sam ran to the house. They looked for their mom. They wanted her to help them. They found her in the kitchen.
"Mom, mom, there is a mosquito!" Lila said. She pointed at the door.
"A mosquito?" Mom said. She looked surprised. "Where is it?"
"It is outside. It is a regular mosquito. It wants to bite us. It is not nice. It is not fun. It is mean." Sam said. He hugged mom's leg.
Mom smiled. She took a spray bottle from the shelf. She filled it with water. She gave it to Lila and Sam.
"Here, take this. This is a magic spray. It will make the mosquito go away. It will not hurt it. It will just make it wet. Do you want to try it?" Mom said.
Lila and Sam nodded. They took the spray bottle. They thanked mom. They went back to the yard. They saw the mosquito. It was still flying and buzzing.
Lila and Sam sprayed the mosquito. They sprayed it a lot. The mosquito got wet. It did not like it. It flew away. It did not come back.
Lila and Sam cheered. They were happy. They had a magic spray. They had no more mosquito. They went back to playing. They moved around and made noises. They had a lot of fun.
