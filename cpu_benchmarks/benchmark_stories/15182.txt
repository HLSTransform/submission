John and his mom were in their home. Suddenly an alarm sounded.
John asked, "What is that?"
"It's the burglar alarm," said mom.
John was scared. But mom said, "Don't worry, John. I'm sure we can solve this!"
John watched as mom rummaged through the cupboard for something. She found a flashlight and said, "We can solve this!"
With the flashlight in hand, John and mom searched for the burglar. Everywhere they looked, there was no sign of the thief!
John was very discouraged. But with a determined look, mom said, "Let's try the backyard!"
John followed mom out to the backyard, where they found a thief trying to get into the tool shed. As they got closer, the thief saw them and ran away. 
Mom gave a triumphant laugh. "We solved it! We were successful!" 
John was so excited and cheered. 
But the celebration was short-lived. They realized the thief had stolen their bike. John was disappointed and upset. 
Mom hugged John and said, "Well, at least we solved the burglar alarm! That was a success!" 
John couldn't help but feel dejected. His mom had been too hopeful. Despite the successful resolution of one small problem, the bad news had overshadowed the good.
