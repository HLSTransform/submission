Once upon a time, there was a mighty dog named Max. Max loved to rush and play all day. One day, Max saw a bright light in the sky. He wanted to find out what it was.
Max ran to his friend, Cat. "Cat, do you see the light?" Max asked. Cat looked up and said, "Yes, I see it too! Let's go find it." So, Max and Cat rushed together to find the light.
They ran and ran until they got very tired. The light was still far away. Max and Cat couldn't reach the light. They were sad and had to go back home. The light stayed in the sky, but Max and Cat never found out what it was.
