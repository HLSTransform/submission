Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play dress-up and wear different costumes. One day, her mommy told her that they were going to celebrate Halloween soon. Lily was very excited and wanted to wear her princess costume.
But when Halloween was still far away, Lily became very impatient. She wanted to wear her costume right away and show it to her friends. She asked her mommy every day if she could wear it, but her mommy said no, they had to wait for Halloween.
Lily became sad and angry. She didn't want to wait anymore. She even had a fight with her best friend who had a new costume too. But when Halloween finally came, Lily was very happy. She put on her princess costume and went trick-or-treating with her friends. They all loved her costume and they had a lot of fun. Lily realized that waiting was worth it and she was happy that they could celebrate Halloween together.
