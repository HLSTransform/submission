Once upon a time, a curious bunny was hopping in the forest. The bunny saw a trap on the ground. The trap was made of metal and had sharp teeth. The bunny knew it was dangerous, so it didn't go near it. 
Suddenly, the bunny saw a carrot on the other side of the trap. The bunny really wanted the carrot, but it didn't want to get caught in the trap. So, the bunny had an idea. It decided to part the trap in the middle with a stick. 
The bunny was able to get the carrot without getting caught in the trap. It was happy and ate the carrot. From that day on, the bunny was very careful when it saw traps in the forest.
