Once upon a time there was a fat cat. One day, the cat found a sparkly jewel in the garden. The cat was so excited and decided to take the jewel home and keep it safe. 
But when night came, the cat was too tired to stay awake. So the cat decided to sleep, but forgot to put the jewel away. 
The next morning when the cat woke up, the jewel was gone! Unfortunately, the cat had been too tired to take care of the precious jewel. 
The cat was very sad and never found the jewel again.
