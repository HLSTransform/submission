Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was very brave. She was curious and loved to explore the world around her.
One day, the little girl heard a loud siren. When she looked outside she saw police cars with flashing lights. She wanted to go outside and take a closer look, but she was scared. She knew that the police were important, but she wasn't sure if it was safe.
Just then, her mom came running out and said, "Don't be scared sweetheart, the police are just passing by. They aren't looking for trouble."
The little girl let out a huge sigh of relief. She worked up her courage and decided to dare to go outside. She carefully opened the door and went outside.
The little girl was excited as she watched the police cars drive off. The sirens were still loud, but mild in the distance. The little girl smiled and knew that she was brave and nothing would stop her from exploring the world around her.
