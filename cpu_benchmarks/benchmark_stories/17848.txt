Once upon a time, there was a little shrimp. He wanted to have a rest and lay in the sun. So he went to the beach and found a special spot. It was close to the water and there was plenty of sunshine. 
He had been laying there for a while when he heard giggling from the other side of the beach. He looked up and saw two little children running around. He had never seen children before and he was a bit nervous. 
He started to feel better when the little boy and girl noticed him. The children were amazed by the little shrimp as they had never seen one before. They asked if it was ok to see him closer and the shrimp said yes. 
The children ran to the water's edge and started playing with the little shrimp. The shrimp was having so much fun that he didn't realize how long it had been since he first lay down in the sand. 
The shrimp enjoyed spending time with the two little children and they all became the best of friends. The children ran off to get their mom and dad to show them the little shrimp, never forgetting the special time they had together at the beach.
