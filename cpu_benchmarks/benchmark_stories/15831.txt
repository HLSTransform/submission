Once upon a time there was an incredible house. It was an amazing house, like no other.
Inside this house, there was a boy who loved to play hide and seek. He was a fun loving boy, but his favourite game was hide and seek. Every day, he would hide and giggle as he waited for someone to find him.
One day, the little boy had a great idea. He decided to go on an adventure and hide outside the house. So he crept out of the door and slowly made his way to the garden.
He was about to pick a spot to hide when he heard a voice. "I'm coming to find you!" said the voice.
The little boy was so excited. It was his best friend, and they were going to have a fun game of hide and seek.
The little boy ran and hid behind a bush and waited. His friend counted to ten and then started to look. It wasn't long before he found him.
"I found you," he said, "You were very good at hiding, but I knew I was going to find you eventually."
The little boy was so happy that his incredible hiding skills were no match for his friend's searching skills. He had found the perfect game of hide and seek.
