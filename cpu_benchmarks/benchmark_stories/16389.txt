Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim did not like math. It made him angry. He had a hard time with it. Tim had a big math test coming up. He was very scared.
One day, Tim was playing outside. He found a magic stick. The stick could strike things and make them better. Tim had an idea. He would use the stick to help him with his math test.
The day of the test came. Tim took the magic stick to school. He struck his math book with the stick. Suddenly, the math problems became easy. Tim was not angry anymore. He did very well on his test. Tim was happy and never scared of math again.
