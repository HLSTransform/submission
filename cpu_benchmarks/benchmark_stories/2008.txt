Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She was only three years old. One day, Sarah decided to go to the garden to pick some radishes.
As Sarah approached the garden, she got a little scared. But she reminded herself that radishes were her favorite vegetable, and so she kept walking. 
Once there, she began gathering her vegetables. She filled her basket but then noticed an old, black snake in the corner of the garden. Sarah was very scared and immediately wanted to quit. But then she remembered how much she loved radishes, so she took a deep breath and kept picking. 
The snake watched her, but then quietly slithered away. When Sarah was all done, she proudly showed her parents the basket full of radishes. Her parents were so proud of her, and Sarah felt brave and proud too!
