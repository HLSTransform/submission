Once upon a time there was a kind rabbit named Hoppy.
One day Hoppy was very tired and wanted to rest, but he couldn't find a comfortable spot. He tried resting his head on a big rock, but it was too hard. He tried resting on a patch of grass, but it was too soft.
Suddenly, Hoppy had an idea! He hopped over to a friendly deer and asked if he could rest his head on her neck. 
The deer was kind and said, "Yes, Hoppy. You can rest your head on my neck."
Hoppy was so grateful and lay down on the deer's neck. He was so comfortable and safe that he quickly fell asleep. He slept peacefully, knowing that the kind deer was watching over him.
