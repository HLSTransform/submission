Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Hoppy. Hoppy loved to hop all day long. He hopped in the grass, and he hopped with his friends. Hoppy was a very honest bunny. He always told the truth.
One day, Hoppy got hurt while hopping. He needed to go see a doctor for animals, called a veterinarian. The veterinarian was very nice and wanted to help Hoppy feel better. Hoppy's mom told him to be honest and tell the veterinarian how he got hurt.
Hoppy did not listen to his mom. He did not want to tell the truth. He told the veterinarian that he got hurt in a different way. The veterinarian tried to help Hoppy, but because Hoppy was not honest, the doctor could not make him feel better.
In the end, Hoppy was still hurt and sad. He learned that it is important to always be honest, even when it is hard to do. If Hoppy had told the truth, he might have felt better sooner. The moral of the story is to always be honest, especially when talking to people who want to help you.
