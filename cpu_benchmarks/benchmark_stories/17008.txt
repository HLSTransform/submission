Lily liked to write in her diary every night. She wrote about her day, her friends, her toys, and her dreams. She kept her diary under her pillow, so no one could see it. She thought it was her secret.
One day, her big brother Tom found her diary. He was bored and wanted to have some fun. He opened the diary and read what Lily wrote. He laughed at her silly words and drawings. He saw that Lily wrote that she liked a boy in her class named Ben. He decided to play a trick on her.
He took a pen and wrote on the diary: "Ben is ugly. He does not like you. He likes me. He thinks you are a baby. Go away." He put the diary back under the pillow and waited for Lily to come back.
Lily came back from school and went to her room. She was happy because she played with Ben at recess. She wanted to write in her diary. She took it out and opened it. She saw the words that Tom wrote. She felt a big hurt in her heart. She started to cry.
She ran to her mom and showed her the diary. She asked her mom who wrote those mean words. Her mom looked at the diary and saw Tom's handwriting. She knew it was him. She was angry and sad. She called Tom and asked him why he did that. Tom said he was just joking. He did not mean to hurt Lily. He said he was sorry.
But Lily did not believe him. She thought he was lying. She thought he hated her. She thought Ben hated her too. She thought everyone hated her. She did not want to write in her diary anymore. She did not want to play with anyone anymore. She did not want to be happy anymore.
She went to her bed and hugged her teddy bear. She prayed to God to make her disappear. She wished she was never born. She closed her eyes and hoped to never wake up.
