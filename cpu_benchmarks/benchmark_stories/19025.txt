Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to ride his bike, but he never wore his helmet. His mom always told him to wear it, but he thought it was too tough to wear.
One day, Timmy decided to go for a ride without his helmet. He was having so much fun that he didn't notice a big rock in his path. He hit the rock and fell off his bike. He hurt his head really badly and had to go to the hospital.
After that, Timmy always wore his helmet when he rode his bike. He learned that it's important to follow safety rules, even if they seem tough. The moral of the story is that safety should always come first, even if it's not fun or easy.
