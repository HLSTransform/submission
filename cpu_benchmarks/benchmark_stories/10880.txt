Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved watching television. Her favorite show was a colorful cartoon about animals. Every day, she would sit in front of the television and watch it for hours.
One day, Lily's mom told her that she needed to take a break from watching television. Lily didn't want to stop watching her favorite show, so she threw a tantrum. She screamed and cried and refused to listen to her mom.
But then, Lily's mom explained to her that watching too much television is not good for her health. It can hurt her eyes and make her lazy. Lily understood and decided to take a break from watching television for a while.
From that day on, Lily learned that it's important to take care of her health and not spend too much time watching television. She found other fun things to do, like playing outside and reading books. And she was happy and healthy. The end.
