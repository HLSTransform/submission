One day, Tommy was walking in the forest. He was looking for something. Suddenly, he saw a twig in the grass. It was red, and he wanted to find it. He wanted to have it.
Tommy ran to the twig and tried to pick it up. But it was too heavy for him. He could not move it.
He was sad and he started to cry.
"Why can't I find the twig?" he asked.
Suddenly, he heard a voice. It was a friendly voice. It said: "Maybe, if you ask for help, you can find the twig!"
Tommy stopped crying. He looked around and saw his friend, Maria. She had come to help him. Together, they were able to pick up the twig.
Tommy was so happy! He thanked Maria and they ran off with their red twig!
