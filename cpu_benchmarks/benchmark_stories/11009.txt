Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big yellow truck. It has many boxes on it. Sara and Tom want to see what is inside the boxes.
"Let's go and look," Sara says. "Maybe there are toys or candy."
"OK," Tom says. "But we have to be quick. Mom will be angry if we are late for meal."
They run to the truck. They climb on it. They open a box. It is full of books. They open another box. It is full of clothes. They open another box. It is full of food.
"Wow," Sara says. "Look at all this food. There are apples and bananas and cookies and cheese. I love food. Do you want some?"
"Yes," Tom says. "I love food too. Let's eat some. No one will know."
They take some food from the box. They sit on the truck. They eat and eat. They are happy.
But they do not see the man who drives the truck. He comes back from the store. He sees Sara and Tom on his truck. He sees the open boxes. He sees the food on the ground. He is very angry.
"Hey, you little thieves!" he shouts. "What are you doing on my truck? How dare you touch my stuff? Get off my truck right now!"
He runs to the truck. He grabs Sara and Tom. He throws them off the truck. He hits them with his hand. He kicks them with his foot. He calls the police.
Sara and Tom are hurt. They are scared. They cry and cry. They wish they never saw the yellow truck. They wish they never ate the food. They wish they listened to Mom. They are in big trouble.
