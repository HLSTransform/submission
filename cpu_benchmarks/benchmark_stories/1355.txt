Once upon a time, there was a tall twig that wanted to travel. It bounced and skipped around the garden, but it soon found itself wanting to go further.
With the wind in its favor, the twig fluttered away, flying high up in the sky. It zoomed over fields and streams, and saw many new places. It even flew so close to a bright, white cloud that it thought it could touch it!
The twig was so excited from its journey, it wanted to show off all its new discoveries. So, it returned to the garden, leaving its tall twig-friends feeling very inspired. From then on, they all decided to travel together and explore even more of the world together.
