Once upon a time, there was a boy who had a brother. They loved to play together in the pool. The boy's brother was very good at swimming. He could swim very fast and very far. The boy was not as good as his brother, but he tried his best. One day, the boy's brother said, "You are a very honest swimmer. I am proud of you." The boy smiled and felt very happy. From that day on, the boy kept trying to swim better and better, and he and his brother had lots of fun together in the pool.
