Tom and Mia like to look at the stars at night. They go outside with their mom and dad and lie on a big blanket. They see many stars in the sky. Some are big and bright, some are small and dim. They try to find shapes and animals in the stars.
One night, Tom sees a star that is moving very fast. He points and says, "Look, a shooting star!" Mia looks and sees it too. She says, "Wow, it's so pretty!" Mom and dad smile and tell them to make a wish. Tom and Mia close their eyes and think of something they want.
Tom wishes for a new bike. He wants to ride fast and far. Mia wishes for a new doll. She wants to play and dress her up. They open their eyes and hope their wishes will come true.
They get up and run to the house. They are happy and excited. But Tom does not see a rock on the ground. He steps on it and slips. He falls and hurts his knee. He cries and says, "Ow, ow, ow!" Mia runs to him and hugs him. She says, "It's okay, Tom. I'm here."
Mom and dad come and help Tom. They clean his knee and put a band-aid on it. They say, "You're brave, Tom. It's just a little scrape. It will heal soon." Tom stops crying and says, "Thank you, mom and dad." He looks at Mia and says, "Thank you, Mia. You're a good sister." Mia smiles and says, "You're welcome, Tom. You're a good brother."
They go inside and get ready for bed. They brush their teeth and put on their pajamas. They hug mom and dad and say, "Good night, we love you." Mom and dad say, "Good night, we love you too." They tuck them in and turn off the light.
Tom and Mia look out the window and see the stars again. They are calm and quiet. They think of their wishes and hope they will come true. They close their eyes and fall asleep. They dream of stars and bikes and dolls. They are happy.
