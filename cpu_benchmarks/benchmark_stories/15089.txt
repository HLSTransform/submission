Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Jack. He went to the park with his mom to try and draw an image with his crayons.
As he was trying to draw, he noticed a normal, little bird sitting on the grass.
Jack said to his mom, "Mom, look at the little bird. Can I try to draw a picture of it?"
"Of course you can," said his mom. She smiled at Jack and handed him a new crayon.
Jack started to draw an image of the bird. He tried his best, and when he was done, he was really proud of what he had created.
"You did it, Jack! That's a great image," said his mom.
Jack smiled. He had done something special today. He felt happy and he was so proud of himself.
