Lily was a wealthy girl who had many toys and dresses. She liked to play with her dolls and pretend they were her friends. But she was not happy, because she had no real friends to share her games with.
One day, she saw a new girl in the park. The girl had a big smile and a red lip. She was playing with a ball and a dog. Lily wanted to play with her, but she was shy and scared.
"Hello, what is your name?" the girl asked Lily, when she saw her watching.
"Lily," Lily said in a small voice.
"I am Anna. Do you want to play with me and my dog? His name is Spot," the girl said, holding out the ball.
Lily nodded and took the ball. She threw it and Spot ran after it. Anna and Lily laughed and ran with him. They had fun playing in the park.
Lily felt happy and brave. She made a new friend. She learned that playing with others can improve her mood. She thanked Anna and Spot for playing with her.
"Can we play again tomorrow?" Lily asked.
"Of course! I would love that. You are a nice friend, Lily," Anna said, giving her a hug.
Lily smiled and hugged her back. She went home with a big smile and a red lip. She was still wealthy, but she was also happy.
