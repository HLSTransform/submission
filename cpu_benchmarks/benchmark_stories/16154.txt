Once there was a little girl called Rosie. Rosie had a mommy and daddy who loved her very much. One day, Rosie and her mommy went to the park to have a picnic.
Rosie wanted to sit on one side of the blanket, but her mommy wanted to sit on the other side. Rosie thought the other side was much nicer and she became very bossy.
Rosie said to her mommy, "I want to sit over there. I want it!" Her mommy said, "We can both manage to sit at the same side of the blanket". Rosie said, "But I want to sit on the other side!"
Mommy smiled and said, "We can both be nice and sit on the same side. That way we can both enjoy our picnic together". So Rosie and her mommy got comfortable on the same side of the blanket, and enjoyed their picnic.
