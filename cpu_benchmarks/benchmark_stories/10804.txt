Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a very tidy room with all his toys in their right places. One day, he saw a bird outside his window and he stared at it for a long time. The bird had a shiny black eye with a small black pupil in the middle. Timmy thought it was very interesting to look at. 
The next day, Timmy went to school and saw his teacher had a tidy desk. He stared at her desk for a while and noticed she had a pencil with a shiny silver tip. He thought it looked very cool. During class, his teacher asked him a question and Timmy looked up at her with his big brown eyes. She smiled and said, "Good job, Timmy!" 
After school, Timmy went back to his tidy room and played with his toys. He looked at each one carefully, making sure they were in their right places. He remembered the bird and the teacher's pencil and thought about how interesting it was to stare at things. Timmy felt very happy in his tidy room with all his toys in their right places.
