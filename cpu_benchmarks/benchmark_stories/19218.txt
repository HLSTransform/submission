Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow, but her hands would always get cold. So, her mommy gave her some gloves to wear. They were pink and fuzzy, and they kept her hands warm.
One day, Lily was playing in the snow with her friend Timmy. They were building a snowman, but it was very messy. Snow was everywhere! Lily's mommy came outside and saw the messy snowman. She shook her head and said, "Oh no, what a mess!"
Lily looked up at her mommy and nodded her head. She knew the snowman was messy, but she was having so much fun playing in the snow with her friend. They finished building the snowman and Lily gave him a big hug. Her gloves kept her hands warm and cozy. She was so happy to have them!
