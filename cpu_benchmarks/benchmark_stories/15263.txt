Jimmy yawned and picked up his doll. He was so curious to see what it would do. Jimmy hugged the doll and squeezed it tight. The doll smiled and winked at him. Jimmy laughed and giggled as he played with it. He ran with it around the house, and made it dance.
Jimmy was so happy and started to get a bit tired. He hugged the doll one more time, and gently put it back on the bed. Jimmy yawned, and then fell asleep, dreaming about his doll.
