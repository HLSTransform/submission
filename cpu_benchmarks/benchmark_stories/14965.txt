Once upon a time, there was a monster that lived on the earth. He was very persistent, and he liked to hide in dark places. One day, the monster heard a little voice. It was a 3 year old child. The child asked the monster to come and play. The monster was scared and he wanted to hide, so he ran away as fast as he could!
The little child was very persistent, however, and he kept calling out to the monster. He said he just wanted to be friends. The monster was still scared, but he slowly began to peek out of his hiding place. Eventually, he plucked up the courage to come out and play.
The monster and the child became friends, and for many years after, the monster came out every day to play. They laughed and smiled together and no matter how scared the monster got, the child was always persistent in asking him to come out and play. 
The monster and the child's friendship was one that could not be broken, and it was the happiest the monster had ever been in his entire life.
