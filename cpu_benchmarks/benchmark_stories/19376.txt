Once upon a time, there was a black cat called Socks. All Socks wanted to do was take a nap. But, every day, all it could do was drink water.
One day, Socks decided to look for something to eat. He went outside and walked around, but he couldn't find anything. He was very thirsty, so he followed his nose and found a big bowl of milk. 
Socks was so happy! He started to drink the milk and it tasted so yummy. After drinking all the milk, Socks had the energy to go back home. There, he was happy and he had a great big nap! 
The end.
