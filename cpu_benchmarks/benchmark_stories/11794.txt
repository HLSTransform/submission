Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jane. Jane liked to go for walks. One morning, she decided to go for a walk with her mom. They went to the park and saw lots of nice things.
Jane wanted to find a special bean. She looked around and soon found a pale bean. It was so pretty! Jane was so excited. She showed it to her mom and they both smiled.
They carried on with their walk and soon they were back home. Jane put the pale bean in a special box so she could look at it whenever she wanted. She was so happy and thanked her mom for the nice walk.
