Once upon a time, there were two friends - Joe and Sue. One day, they went to the playground. Joe wanted to weigh himself on the big scales. So he stepped onto the scales, and the arrow moved to show how much he weighed. "Wow!" said Joe, "I'm so heavy!" Then Sue said, "Let's go and dance!"
So Joe and Sue danced around and around the playground. They danced all kinds of amazing dances, like twirling, spinning and jumping. They even made up their own dances! Joe and Sue laughed and giggled as they danced. They had so much fun in the playground that they forgot all about the scales. They had a wonderful day!
