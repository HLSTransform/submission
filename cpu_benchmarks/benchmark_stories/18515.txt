Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their new toy. It is a big cable with many colors. They can make shapes with the cable. They can make a circle, a square, a triangle, and more.
One day, they want to make a star. They ask their mom how to do it. Mom shows them how to bend the cable. She says, "You need to make five points. Like this, and this, and this, and this, and this. Then you connect the ends. See? A star!"
Lily and Ben try to make a star. They repeat what mom did. They bend the cable and make five points. But they forget to connect the ends. Their star looks like a flower.
Mom sees their flower. She smiles and says, "That's a beautiful flower! But it's not a star. Do you want to try again?"
Lily and Ben nod. They want to make a star. They undo their flower. They repeat what mom did. They bend the cable and make five points. This time, they remember to connect the ends. Their star looks like a star.
Mom sees their star. She claps and says, "That's a wonderful star! You did it! I'm so proud of you!"
Lily and Ben hug mom. They are happy. They like their new toy. They like to make shapes with the cable. They wonder what else they can make.
