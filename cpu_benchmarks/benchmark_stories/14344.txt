Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to hear stories from her grandma. One day, Lily asked her grandma to tell her a story about a fast rabbit. 
Grandma started to tell the story, "Once upon a time, there was a rabbit who could run very fast. He loved to run and play with his friends. One day, he challenged his friends to a race. They all laughed and said, 'You will never win, rabbit!' But the rabbit was determined to win the race." 
Lily interrupted, "Did the rabbit win the race?" 
Grandma smiled and continued, "Yes, the rabbit won the race! All his friends were amazed and they laughed and cheered for him. From that day on, the rabbit was known as the fastest rabbit in the forest." 
Lily laughed and said, "That was a great story, grandma! Can you tell me another one?" 
Grandma nodded and said, "Of course, my dear. I have many more stories to tell."
