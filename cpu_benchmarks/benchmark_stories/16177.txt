Two children, Jack and Jane, met in the park one day. They spotted each other and Jack let out a big smile.
"Let's have a race," said Jack.
"Okay," Jane nodded.
Both children started running. Jack was very competitive, running ahead of Jane. She tried to keep up, but Jack was too fast.
Jane felt discouraged. "It's not fair," she complained.
Jack paused. "Let's make it a fair race," he said. "Let's start from the same spot at the same time. That way, it'll be fair for both of us."
Jane smiled and nodded. They both ran to the same spot, lined up and started their race.
The race was very competitive but in the end, Jane was happy to discover that she won.
Jack smiled. "Well done, Jane! That was a great race!"
