Lily was very happy. It was her birthday. She had a cake with four candles. She had a pink dress and a crown. She had many friends to play with.
"Happy birthday, Lily!" her friends said. They gave her hugs and gifts. Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, thank you!"
Then, her mom said, "It's time to blow the candles, Lily. Make a wish!" Lily closed her eyes and thought hard. She wished for something very special.
She opened her eyes and blew the candles. The lights went off and the room was dark. Lily heard a noise. She looked around and saw a big surprise.
It was a puppy! A cute, fluffy, brown puppy. It ran to Lily and licked her face. Lily laughed and hugged the puppy. She felt its soft fur and warm tongue.
"Mom, dad, is this for me?" Lily asked.
"Yes, sweetie, it is. Happy birthday, Lily. We love you," her mom and dad said.
Lily was so happy. She had a cake, a dress, a crown, friends, and a puppy. She felt very lucky.
She said, "I love you, too. And I love my puppy. What is his name?"
"You can name him, Lily. It's your choice," her dad said.
Lily thought for a moment. She looked at the puppy and said, "I will name him Lucky. Because he is lucky to have me, and I am lucky to have him."
Her friends clapped and cheered. They said, "That's a great name, Lily. Lucky is lucky. And you are lucky. Happy birthday, Lily!"
Lily and Lucky smiled and wagged their tails. They had a lot of fun. They played, ate, and sang. It was the best birthday ever.
