Ben and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys and books. One day, Ben has a new toy. It is a big orange truck. He is very happy.
"Look at my truck, Mia!" Ben says. "It can make noises and move by itself. It is the best toy ever!"
Mia looks at the truck. She likes it too. She wants to play with it. "Can I try your truck, Ben?" she asks.
Ben shakes his head. "No, Mia. It is mine. You can't touch it. Go play with your own toys."
Mia feels sad. She thinks Ben is not nice. She goes to play with her doll. She does not talk to Ben.
The next day, Ben's grandma comes to visit. She brings a present for Ben. It is a book. It has pictures and stories. Ben likes books. He opens the present.
"Thank you, grandma!" Ben says. "What is this book about?"
Grandma smiles. "It is a book about sharing, Ben. It tells you why sharing is good and how it can make you and others happy. Do you want me to read it to you?"
Ben nods. He sits with grandma and listens to the book. He learns that sharing can help him gain more friends, more fun and more love. He thinks about Mia and his truck. He feels sorry.
"Grandma, can I ask you something?" Ben says.
"Of course, Ben. What is it?"
"Can I share my truck with Mia? I think she likes it too. And I want to be her friend again."
Grandma hugs Ben. "That is a very good idea, Ben. I am proud of you. Sharing is a wonderful thing to do. I am sure Mia will be happy too."
Ben runs to find Mia. He sees her playing with her doll. He holds his truck and smiles.
"Mia, I am sorry I was not nice to you. Do you want to play with my truck? We can take turns and have fun together."
Mia looks at Ben. She sees his truck and his smile. She feels happy. She nods.
"Thank you, Ben. That is very kind of you. I am sorry I was sad. Yes, I want to play with your truck. And I want to be your friend again."
Ben and Mia hug. They play with the truck and the doll. They laugh and talk. They are happy. They learn that sharing can make them gain more than they lose.
