Once upon a time, there was a new red ball. The red ball wanted to go on an adventure. It rolled out of the house and down the street. The red ball saw a big tree, a small dog, and a tall man. The red ball was very happy.
One day, the red ball met a blue square. The blue square wanted to go on an adventure too. They went to a fun park. They played on the slide, the swing, and the see-saw. The red ball and the blue square had a great time together.
After playing, the red ball and the blue square were tired. They went back to the red ball's house. The red ball showed the blue square a big cupboard. Inside the cupboard, there were many toys. They played with the toys until it was time to sleep. The red ball and the blue square became best friends.
