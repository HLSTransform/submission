Once upon a time, little David was walking in the park with his mom. As they walked together, they stopped by a big bush.
David's mom said, "Be careful, David. Don't get too close to the bush. There might be something in there."
But David was excited and wanted to explore. He said, "Mommy, I want to get closer to the bush. Please let me take a look!"
Mom nodded and said, "Okay, just be careful. Don't go too far."
Carefully, David stepped closer to the bush. He heard a rustling in the leaves and saw a big rabbit hopping away. David smiled and waved goodbye to the rabbit.
Finally, David got back to his mommy. She said, "Did you have a good look at the bush, David?"
David smiled and said, "Yes, I did!"
