Sandy loved drums. He was very excited when his mom gave him one for his birthday. Every day, he would take it outside and bang on it. He made a lot of noise and it made him happy.
One day, Sandy was banging away on his drum when he began to sneeze. His mom came outside and said, "Oh, Sandy, don't play on the smelly drum. You will make yourself sick."
Sandy did not understand and said, "But why can't I play on my drum?" His mom replied, "Because it makes your sneezes worse and that's not healthy."
But Sandy still did not understand why the drum was smelly. His mom said, "The drum has been sitting in the attic for a long time, and it absorbs a lot of dust and dirt. That smell makes you sneeze!"
Sandy thought about it and felt bad for not understanding. He hugged his mom and said "I'm sorry, mom, I didn't want to get sick!"
His mom laughed and said, "That's ok, as long as you promise to stay away from smelly drums now." Sandy promised, and they both laughed.
