Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to drink juice, especially orange juice. One day, her mom gave her apple juice instead. Lily made a face and said, "I hate apple juice, Mommy. Can I have orange juice instead?"
Her mom said, "Sorry, Lily. We don't have any more orange juice. But you can have the apple juice or some water."
Lily thought for a moment and then said, "Okay, I'll have the apple juice, but I don't like it." She drank the apple juice, but it didn't taste as good as the orange juice she loved.
Later that day, Lily's dad came home from work. He had been on a distant trip for a long time. Lily was so happy to see him and ran to give him a big hug. She said, "Daddy, I missed you so much! Can we have orange juice together?" Her dad smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. Let's have some orange juice and catch up on all the things we missed while I was away."
