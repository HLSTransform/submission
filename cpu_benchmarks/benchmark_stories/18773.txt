Ben liked to fly his kite in the park. He had a red kite with a long tail. He ran and ran and made the kite go high in the sky. He felt happy and free.
But one day, a big wind came and took his kite away. Ben tried to hold on, but the string broke. He saw his kite fly over the trees and out of sight. He felt sad and angry. He wanted his kite back.
He ran after the kite, but he could not find it. He got lost in the park. He did not know where he was. He felt scared and alone. He wanted his mom and dad.
He saw a pond with ducks and swans. He thought maybe his kite fell in the water. He went closer to look. He saw something red and long in the pond. He thought it was his kite. He reached out to grab it.
But it was not his kite. It was a snake. The snake was mad and bit Ben's hand. Ben screamed and let go. He felt pain and shock. He wanted help.
He heard a voice. It was his mom. She heard his scream and came to find him. She saw the snake and the bite. She felt worried and troubled. She wanted to make Ben better.
She picked him up and hugged him. She told him it was okay. She took him to the car. She drove him to the doctor. The doctor gave him medicine and a bandage. He told him he would be fine.
Ben felt better and safer. He thanked his mom and the doctor. He still missed his kite, but he was glad he had his mom. He learned a lesson. He would not go near the pond again. He would bathe his hand every day until it healed. He would ask his mom for a new kite. He hoped it would be red.
