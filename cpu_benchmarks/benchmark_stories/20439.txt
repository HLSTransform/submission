Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily liked to help her mommy in the kitchen. Her mommy always wore an apron when she cooked. One day, Lily asked her mommy, "Mommy, why do you wear that apron?" Her mommy replied, "I wear this apron to keep my clothes clean while I cook."
Lily wanted to help her mommy too, so she put on her own little apron. She helped her mommy mix the ingredients for a cake. Her mommy said, "Lily, can you point to the sugar?" Lily pointed to the sugar and her mommy smiled.
After they finished baking, they sat down to eat the cake. Lily's daddy said, "This cake is delicious! Did you make it all by yourself?" Lily replied, "No, I helped mommy. I'm not ignorant." Everyone laughed and enjoyed the yummy cake. The end.
