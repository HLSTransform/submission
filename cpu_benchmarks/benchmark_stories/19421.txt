Once there was a girl named Emma. She was 3 years old and really liked to play outside. One day, Emma got out of her house in the morning and she saw a big hoop on the ground. It was really shiny! She couldn't resist taking it, so she grabbed it in her hands and started jumping through it. She was having so much fun. 
Suddenly the sun started to shine brighter and brighter. Emma got so excited that she started spinning with the hoop, faster and faster. The bright sunshine made the hoop shine like it was made of gold. Everywhere she looked, it was calm and peaceful.
Emma kept spinning around with the hoop until she was so tired that she couldn't move! She laid down on the ground and watched the clouds move across the sky. Everything felt so calm and peaceful. Soon enough, she fell asleep and had the nicest dream.
When she woke up, she looked over and saw her hoop lying beside her. She was so happy to see that it was still there! She gave it a big hug and ran back home, still feeling the calm and peaceful feeling from the shiny hoop.
