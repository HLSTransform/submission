Once upon a time, there was a little girl named May. She was three years old and she loved playing in the park with all her friends.
One day, her mommy said to her: "May, it's time for your bath!" May wanted to get in the bath but she was a bit scared.
May's friend Robert had a bathtub, and May wanted one too. She was so envious of Robert that she asked her mommy if they could get a bathtub.
So the next day, May's mommy took her to the store to pick out a bathtub. She asked May: "Which bathtub do you want, May?"
May picked out a bathtub that was pink with lots of bubbles on it. She was so excited and couldn't wait to take a bath.
May and her mommy brought the bathtub home and put it in the bathroom. May said: "I love my new bathtub!" and she jumped in to take a bubble bath.
The end.
