Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a pretty flower and wanted to smell it. But the flower was too high for her to reach.
Lily's mommy came outside and asked, "What are you doing, sweetie?"
"I want to smell the flower, but it's too high," Lily said.
Mommy picked up a spray bottle and said, "Let's spray the flower with water so it will come down an inch or two."
Lily watched as mommy sprayed the flower. It came down just enough for her to smell it. "Mmm, it smells yummy!" she said.
