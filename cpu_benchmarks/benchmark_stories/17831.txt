Once upon a time there was a little bear. The bear was very tired and very heavy. He had been walking all day, looking for a place to store his things. He found the perfect spot - a cave deep in the woods. 
The bear shuffled his heavy weight up to the cave and peered inside. It was dark and cozy, and best of all - empty! He stepped inside and gathered his things together. Then he began to store them away, neatly tucked away in the corner.
Once everything was stored away, the bear felt much better. He was relieved to have found a safe place for his belongings. He curled up in a corner of the cave and soon fell asleep, exhausted after such a long day. 
The bear was safe and happy in his cozy cave, surrounded by the things he had stored away. The end!
