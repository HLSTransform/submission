Tom and Lily liked to play in the big armchair in the living room. They pretended it was a boat and they could sail to faraway places. They used pillows and blankets to make sails and flags. They took turns to be the captain and the sailor.
One day, they found a purple scarf in the closet. They thought it would make a beautiful sail for their boat. They tied it to the armchair and shouted, "All aboard! We are sailing to the land of purple!"
They had fun imagining all the purple things they would see and do. They saw purple flowers, purple birds, purple mountains, and purple candy. They sang songs and told stories.
But then, Mom came home. She saw the purple scarf on the armchair and got very angry. She said, "That's my scarf! How dare you use it for your silly game! You ruined it with your knots and wrinkles! You are very naughty children!"
She took the scarf away and scolded them. She said they had to go to their rooms and stay there until dinner. She said they could not play with the armchair anymore. She said they had to apologize and pay for a new scarf.
Tom and Lily felt very sad and sorry. They cried and hugged each other. They wished they had never found the purple scarf. They wished they could sail away to a happier place.
