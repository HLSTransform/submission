Once there was a princess who was very polite. Everywhere she went she said police words and was very kind to everyone. One day, she went out to look at the stars and spotted a comet in the night sky. She wished that she could be like the comet and go on all kinds of adventures in the sky. To her surprise, the comet suddenly flew down and came right to the Princess. 
The comet spoke to the Princess and told her that she could become a part of the comet and experience all of the adventures she wished for. The Princess was so excited and accepted the offer. She became a part of the comet and went on many adventures in the night sky, exploring different worlds and galaxies.
The Princess had so much fun exploring and learning about all the wonderful things in space. Everywhere she went, she was polite, kind, and thoughtful to everyone she met. Her travels atop the comet were a memorable experience for the princess.
