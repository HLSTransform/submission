Sara and Ben are playing in the park. They have a ball and a shelter. The shelter is a big box with a hole. They put the box under a tree and pretend it is their house.
Sara says, "I want to throw the ball. You catch it, Ben." She throws the ball to Ben. Ben catches it and throws it back. They have fun.
But then, a big dog comes. The dog is black and brown. It has sharp teeth and loud bark. It sees the ball and runs to get it. Sara and Ben are scared. They run to their shelter and hide.
The dog takes the ball in its mouth. It shakes it and bites it. The ball is pink, but now it has holes and dirt. The dog drops the ball and looks for Sara and Ben. It smells their shelter and goes to the hole.
Sara and Ben hug each other. They cry and shout, "Go away, dog! Leave us alone!" The dog growls and tries to get in. It scratches the box and makes a big noise.
But then, a man comes. The man is the dog's owner. He has a leash and a whistle. He sees the dog and the shelter. He hears Sara and Ben. He says, "Bad dog! Come here, now!" He blows the whistle and pulls the leash. The dog stops and follows the man.
Sara and Ben peek out of the hole. They see the man and the dog. They are happy and relieved. The man says, "I'm sorry, kids. My dog likes balls, but he doesn't know how to play nice. Are you okay?" Sara and Ben nod. They say, "We're okay, thank you. But our ball is ruined." The man looks at the ball. He says, "I'm sorry, again. Here, take this." He gives them a new ball. The ball is pink and shiny. Sara and Ben smile. They say, "Thank you, sir. You are very kind." The man says, "You're welcome. Have fun, but be careful. Bye." He and the dog leave.
Sara and Ben look at their new ball. They are happy. They say, "Let's play again. But this time, let's throw the ball far away from the dog." They go out of their shelter and throw the ball. They have fun.
