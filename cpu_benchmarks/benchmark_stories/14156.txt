Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Jenny. She was feeling very anxious, so one day she chose to go outside and sit on the bench. It was very cold, but the bench was warm, and she liked that part.
Jenny looked around, and soon she spotted a puppy in the park. She felt much happier seeing it! She ran to pet the puppy, scratching it behind its ears, until it barked and ran away. Jenny laughed. 
She chose to take a seat on the bench again, and watched the birds overhead. They flew by, chirping happily and soaring through the sky. Just watching them made Jenny feel less anxious.
Jenny was so happy she decided to stay outside, watching the birds and dreaming, until it was time to go back home.
