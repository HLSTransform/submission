Once there was a little girl named Anna. She was 3 years old and loved to act. One day she was looking around, trying to figure out what to act. Suddenly, she saw something pink and unknown. She got excited and ran towards it! It was a big, pink balloon. She acted out her role of being a balloon, waving her hands in the air. She then span around, just like a balloon would. After a few minutes, Anna decided that it was time to be something else and the balloon act was over. She felt so happy, like she had found a new and unknown world!
