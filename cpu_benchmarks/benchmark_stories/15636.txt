Tom and Sue like to collect things. They collect rocks, leaves, shells and toys. One day, they decide to collect soup. They take a big pot and go around the house. They put water, milk, salt, sugar, bread, cheese, ketchup, jam, cereal, eggs and bananas in the pot. They stir and stir and stir.
"Look, we made soup!" Tom says. "Let's taste it!"
They each take a spoon and dip it in the pot. They put the soup in their mouths and make a terrible face.
"Yuck! This soup is terrible!" Sue says. "It is too sweet and too salty and too mushy and too sticky!"
They spit out the soup and run to the sink. They wash their mouths with water and brush their teeth.
"Let's never collect soup again!" Tom says. "It is a bad idea!"
"Let's collect something else!" Sue says. "Something that is not food!"
They agree and go to their room. They find their crayons and paper and start to collect drawings. They draw flowers, animals, stars and rainbows. They are happy and forget about the terrible soup.
