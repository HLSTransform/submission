One long day, a little boy walked to church. He had heard it was a special place, so he wanted to go and see. As he arrived, he saw a big, old building with lots of windows and doors. He was a bit scared so he decided to lie on the grass just outside the church.
When he lay down, he could feel the sunshine making him feel nice and warm. He could also hear the birds tweeting in the trees. He was so happy, he forgot why he had come to the church. He just lay there, enjoying the nice summer day.
Then he heard a loud noise coming from inside the church. It sounded like lots of people were singing. The little boy got up and tiptoed closer to the church to listen.
And that's when he realised how lucky he was to have such a wonderful church near him. He knew he could come back anytime and listen to the singing. It was nice and special to lie in the sunshine, enjoying the sounds coming from the church.
