Once upon a time, there was a big ship. The ship was very fancy. It had many colors and pretty things. One day, the ship met a small boat. The small boat was not fancy. It was just a simple boat.
The big ship said, "Hey, little boat! I am so fancy, and you are not. I can go fast and you are slow." The big ship liked to tease the small boat. The small boat was sad but did not say anything.
One day, there was a big storm. The fancy ship was scared. The small boat said, "Don't worry, big ship. I will help you." The small boat helped the big ship to be safe. The big ship said, "Thank you, little boat. I am sorry for teasing you. You are a good friend." From that day on, the big ship and the small boat were best friends.
