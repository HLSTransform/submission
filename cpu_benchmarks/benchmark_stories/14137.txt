Once upon a time, there lived a hairy dragon. The dragon was very strong and liked to fly around. But his flying wasn't very good. He could only go a short distance and wasn't very fast.
One day, the dragon decided he wanted to improve his flying. He went looking for help. He found a wise owl who knew the secret to better flying. The owl told him he must practice every day.
So, the dragon practiced each morning and each night. He improved a little bit each day. Pretty soon he was flying faster and higher and further than ever before.
The dragon was so excited! He thanked the wise owl for teaching him how to fly better. Then, he flew off into the sky, happy and strong.
