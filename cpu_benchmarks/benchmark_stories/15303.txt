Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl who loved to explore and play. She had a special camera her mom gave her that she could take wherever she went.
One day, the little girl decided to test out her camera. She held it up to her eye and twirled around so that she could see the world better. It felt so comfortable and she smiled.
She went to different places with her camera and tested it out. She tried taking pictures of her family, the garden, and her toys. Everywhere she went, she was testing the camera.
When she got home, she proudly showed her mom all the pictures she had taken. Her mom was so happy to see her little girl using the camera and learning so much. They looked through them together and the little girl smiled, feeling comfortable and content.
