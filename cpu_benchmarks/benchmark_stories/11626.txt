Once upon a time, a little girl was walking by a garden and saw a vase. It was very pretty with flowers on it. She wanted to pick it up, but her mom said she shouldn't. So, she asked her mom what she should do. 
Her mom told her that God wants us to be good and provide for others. She said the vase should stay in the garden to help the flowers grow. 
The little girl thought about it and decided that was a good idea. Every day, she visited the garden and watered the flowers around the vase, so they could stay healthy and pretty. She was so happy to help her mom and God provide for others. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to help and serve others. Being good and providing for those around us will make us and them happy.
