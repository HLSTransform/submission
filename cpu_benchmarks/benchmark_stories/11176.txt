Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and run around. But one day, her mom told her she needed to do some exercise. 
Lily didn't understand what exercise meant, so she asked her mom. "What's exercise?" she asked. 
"It's when you move your body to stay healthy," her mom replied. 
Lily decided to try it out and started doing jumping jacks. But after a few minutes, she got tired and said, "I don't like exercise. It's too hard." 
Her mom said, "You might regret not exercising when you're older and your body doesn't work as well." 
Lily didn't want to be ignorant, so she listened to her mom and did a few more exercises. She realized it wasn't so bad after all and felt proud of herself for trying something new.
