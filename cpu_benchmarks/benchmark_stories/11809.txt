Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She was just three years old! One day, Sarah decided to organize her toys. She was struggling to find something in particular - it was her favourite belt. She knew it was yellow and it sparkled in the sun. 
Sarah looked everywhere she could think of, but still couldn't find it. She asked her mom, “Mommy, have you seen my belt? I can't find it anywhere.” 
Her mom smiled and said, “Of course, Sarah, it's in your toy box!”
Sarah ran over to the toy box, and sure enough it was there. It was pale, with yellow sparkles. She was so happy. She put the belt around her waist and danced around the room with excitement.
Sarah had done a great job organizing her toys, and wearing her favourite belt made her feel even more proud. She was so excited that she ran off to tell her friends all about it.
