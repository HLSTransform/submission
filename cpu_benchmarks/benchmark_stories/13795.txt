Sara loves her bird, Sunny. Sunny is yellow and sings a lot. Sara likes to watch Sunny in his birdcage. Sometimes, Sara wants to play with Sunny outside the birdcage. But Mom says no.
"Sunny needs to stay in his birdcage, Sara. He is safe and happy there. If he goes outside, he might fly away or get hurt by a cat or a dog," Mom says.
"But Mom, I want to hold Sunny and pet him. He is my friend. He likes me too. Please, Mom, please," Sara insists.
Mom shakes her head. "No, Sara, I'm sorry. You can talk to Sunny and give him some seeds, but you can't take him out of his birdcage. Maybe when you are older, you can learn how to handle him gently and carefully. But not now."
Sara feels sad and angry. She thinks Mom is mean and unfair. She decides to wait until Mom is busy in the kitchen. Then, she sneaks into the living room and opens the birdcage. She reaches for Sunny and tries to grab him. But Sunny is scared and flaps his wings. He flies out of the birdcage and out of the window. Sara gasps and runs after him.
"Sunny, Sunny, come back!" she cries. "I'm sorry, Sunny, I didn't mean to scare you. Please, Sunny, please."
But Sunny is gone. He is in the sky, with the other birds. He feels free and happy. He sings a loud song. He doesn't want to go back to the birdcage.
Sara is in the yard, with tears in her eyes. She sees Mom coming out of the house. She knows Mom will be angry and sad too. She doesn't know what to say.
"Mom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she sobs. "I just wanted to play with Sunny. I thought he would be fine. But he flew away. He flew away, Mom."
Mom hugs Sara and sighs. She is angry and sad too. But she also loves Sara and understands her. She knows Sara didn't mean to hurt Sunny. She knows Sara learned a hard lesson.
"It's okay, Sara, it's okay," she says. "I know you love Sunny. But you have to remember that he is a bird, not a toy. He needs his birdcage to be safe and happy. He is not like us. He belongs to the sky, not to the house. Maybe he will come back someday, maybe not. But we have to let him go. We have to say goodbye to Sunny."
