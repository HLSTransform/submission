Once upon a time, there was a clever bunny. She loved to jump around and play in her garden. One day, she heard a strange noise. It sounded like it came from the sky!
The bunny said to herself, "What can that be?" With curiosity, she went closer to look. She saw a shooting star!
The bunny was so excited. She said, "Oh wow! I wish I can touch it!"
Just then, an angel flew down and handed the bunny a magical brush. The angel said, "You can use it to reach that shooting star. Be quick, though. You don't have much time."
The bunny was so glad. She quickly used the brush to fly up to the star. As she touched it, it sparkled with the brightest light.
The bunny was so happy! She carefully flew back to the ground, thanked the angel and ran off to share her wonderful story with her friends.
