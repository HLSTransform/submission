Once upon a time, there was a leopard who liked to race. He was very fast and loved to show off his speed. One day, he challenged all the other animals in the jungle to a race. Everyone was scared because they knew the leopard was very fast.
But a little mouse decided to join the race too. The leopard laughed and said, "You are so small, you will never win!" But the mouse didn't give up. He ran and ran as fast as he could. And to everyone's surprise, he won the race!
The leopard felt terrible for making fun of the little mouse. He learned that it's not nice to laugh at others and that everyone is good at something. From that day on, the leopard became friends with the mouse and they raced together, but this time, just for fun.
