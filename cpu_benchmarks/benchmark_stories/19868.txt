Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with fire, but his mommy always told him not to because it could burn him. One day, Timmy didn't listen to his mommy and he got burned. He cried and cried, but his mommy took care of him and put medicine on his burn.
After that day, Timmy learned that fire can be dangerous and he shouldn't play with it. He started to explore space instead. He loved to look at the stars at night and wonder what was up there. One night, he saw a shooting star and made a wish.
The next day, Timmy woke up feeling very sleepy. He didn't want to get out of bed, but his mommy told him he needed to go to school. Timmy didn't want to go, but his mommy explained that school was important and he needed to learn new things. Timmy realized that even though he was sleepy, he needed to go to school and learn so he could explore space even more one day.
