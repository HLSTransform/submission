Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They see a big slide. Lily wants to go first. She climbs up the steps and sits on the slide. She says, "Whee!" and slides down.
Ben follows her. He climbs up the steps and sits on the slide. He says, "Whee!" and slides down too. But he slides too fast and falls off the slide. He lands on the wood chips. He says, "Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Lily runs to him. She says, "Are you okay, Ben?" She helps him get up. She sees a scratch on his knee. She says, "You have a boo-boo. Let me kiss it." She kisses his knee. He says, "Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend."
They hug each other. They see a man with a cart. He is selling ice cream. They run to him. They ask, "Can we have some ice cream, please?" He says, "Sure, what flavor do you want?" They say, "Chocolate!" He gives them each a cone with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. They say, "Thank you, mister!" They lick their ice cream. They say, "Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!" They smile and laugh. They forget about the fall. They are happy.
