Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play by the ocean and watch the boats go by. One day, she saw a big, white yacht sailing in the distance. 
Lily ran to her mom and said, "Mommy, look at the big boat! It's so pretty!" 
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, it's a delicate yacht. We have to be careful not to slip on the rocks while we watch it." 
Lily nodded and held her mom's hand as they walked to the shore. They watched the yacht sail by, and Lily said, "I wish I could ride on that boat one day." 
Her mom replied, "Maybe one day you will, but for now, let's enjoy watching it from here." And so, they sat by the ocean and watched the delicate yacht sail away into the horizon.
