Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ellie. Ellie was very curious. Everywhere she went she wanted to explore. One day she was walking in the forest and she saw something in the distance. It was a gray tent. Ellie walked over and pushed open the tent door. "Hello!" she said. She looked inside and there was someone sitting inside the tent. He was an old man.
The old man looked at Ellie with a smile. "Hello!" he said. "I'm Marco. Can I help you?" Ellie was stunned. She didn't know what to say! "I believe I'm lost," she finally answered.
Marco said, "That's okay. You can stay in my tent. I will show you the way back."
Ellie was so happy! She said, "Thank you! I believe you're very kind."
From then on, Ellie visited Marco every day and they went exploring together. They had lots of adventures. And Ellie always knew she could believe in Marco to show her the way.
