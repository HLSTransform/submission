Ben and Sam were friends who liked to play football. They had a big football that was red and blue. They played with it every day in the park.
One day, a big boy came to the park. He saw Ben and Sam's football and wanted it. He ran to them and said, "Give me your football. It is mine now."
Ben and Sam were scared and angry. They did not want to give their football to the big boy. They said, "No, it is our football. We found it first. Go away."
The big boy did not listen. He grabbed the football and tried to pull it away from Ben and Sam. They held on to the football and tried to pull it back. They all pulled and pulled until the football ripped. The red and blue parts separated and flew in different directions.
Ben and Sam were sad and anxious. They looked at their broken football and cried. The big boy was also sad and anxious. He looked at his hands and saw that he had hurt them. He said, "I'm sorry. I was wrong. I should not have taken your football. Can we be friends?"
Ben and Sam stopped crying and looked at the big boy. They saw that he was sorry and that he had hurt himself. They said, "It's okay. We forgive you. We can be friends. But we need a new football."
The big boy nodded and smiled. He said, "I have a new football at home. It is green and yellow. I can share it with you. Come with me. We can play together."
Ben and Sam nodded and smiled. They followed the big boy to his home. They played with his new football and had fun. They learned to share and to be kind. They became good friends.
