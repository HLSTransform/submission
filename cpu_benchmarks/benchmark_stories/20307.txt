Ben and Sam are brothers. They like to play in the garden. They dig holes and find bugs and rocks. One day, they find a big root. It is brown and hard and dull.
"Look, Ben, a root!" Sam says. He tries to pull it out of the ground, but it is too strong.
"Let me help you, Sam," Ben says. He grabs the other end of the root and pulls with Sam. They pull and pull, but the root does not move.
"Maybe we can fix it," Sam says. He runs to the shed and gets a saw. He brings it back to the root and tries to cut it. But the saw is dull and does not work.
"This saw is no good, Sam," Ben says. He shakes his head. "We need something else."
He thinks for a moment. Then he has an idea. He runs to the house and gets a big pot of water. He brings it back to the root and pours it on it.
"Maybe the water will make the root soft," Ben says. He hopes it will work.
They wait for a while. Then they try to pull the root again. This time, the root comes out of the ground. It is wet and muddy and heavy.
"Yay, we did it, Ben!" Sam says. He smiles and hugs his brother. "We fixed the root!"
They drag the root to the shed and put it next to the saw. They are proud of their work. They go back to the garden and look for more things to fix.
