One warm, sunny day, a mother drove her car to the store. She left her three year old daughter in the car while she went inside to get some things. When she came back, she had a surprise for her daughter - a new toy car! 
The little girl was so excited, but she knew that she couldn't play with it in the car. Her mother smiled and said, "We're going to go for a ride today, so you can show me how to drive your new car." 
The little girl could hardly contain her excitement as she got into the car and drove it around the block. As they drove, the sky became grey and rain started to fall. But despite the inclement weather, the little girl felt warm and happy driving her new car.
When they got home, the mother said, "That was an excellent job driving, honey. I'm so proud of you!" The little girl smiled with joy as her mother reached into her pocket and handed her a small key. "I think you're ready to drive your car on your own now. Let's keep it a secret though - it's our little surprise!" 
The little girl was so excited to finally drive her own car and she thanked her mother for her gift. From that day forward, the two of them would spend countless hours playing with the car and taking rides in the warm sunshine.
