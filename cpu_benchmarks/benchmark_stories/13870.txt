Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. Tom was a happy boy who had many toys. He had a big ball, a red car, and a cute teddy bear. But Tom wanted to own something new and fun.
One day, Tom saw a high cake in the kitchen. The cake was big and had many colors. It looked very yummy. Tom wanted to own the cake, so he asked his mom if he could have it. His mom said yes, but only after dinner.
Tom ate his dinner very fast. He was so excited to own the cake. After dinner, his mom gave him a big piece of the high cake. Tom ate the cake and it was very yummy. He was so happy that he owned the cake and shared it with his family. Everyone enjoyed the cake and they all had big smiles.
