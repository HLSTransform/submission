"Look, Mommy!" said Mark. He was pointing to a shiny car in the driveway. The car was going backwards. He'd never seen a car move like that before.
"That's called reversing, Mark," said Mommy. "It's part of driving. The driver is moving the car back into the correct spot. It's like a history lesson; we're moving back in time."
Mark was excited. He ran over to the car and waved at the driver. The driver waved back.
But then Mark noticed something. The driver was alone. He had no friends, no family in the car. He was so lonely.
Mark wanted to help; he wanted to be the driver's friend. So, he ran over to the driver and gave him a hug.
The driver looked surprised. He smiled at Mark, and thanked him for the kindness. Then he drove away, reversing back into the future.
