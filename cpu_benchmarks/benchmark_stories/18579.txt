Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the grass with her friends. One day, they found a big, heavy rock. They tried to pick it up, but it was too heavy for them. Then, they saw a butterfly flying around. They wanted to catch it, so they got a net. They chased the butterfly, but it was too fast. Finally, Lily whispered to her friends to be quiet and the butterfly landed on the net. They were so happy and let it go back to the sky. The end.
