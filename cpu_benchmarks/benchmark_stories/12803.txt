Once upon a time there was a little girl called Mia. Today was Mia's first day at school and she was very excited. Mia's Mum knew she was nervous and wanted to make sure she would be safe. To do this she made Mia a special bag with a pocket on the outside. 
Mum said "This pocket will support you and keep you safe. It has a leak-proof lining to keep your things dry. You can put things in it that make you feel safe and comfortable."
Mia was so happy and she thanked her Mum. She put in things that made her feel safe, like her favourite teddy bear. Then she put the pocket over her shoulder, made sure the zipper was closed properly and confidently went off to school.
