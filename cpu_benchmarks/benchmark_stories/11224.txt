Once upon a time there was an adorable turkey named Peter. Peter was very proud of his feathers and enjoyed the great outdoors.
One day, Peter's owner wanted to take him to a different place. Peter didn't want to go and he resisted by flapping his feathers and running away. 
The owner kept trying to catch Peter, but he kept resisting. Eventually, the owner decided to take out the biggest net they had, and they caught the turkey.
Peter was very scared and he started squawking really loud. His feathers were all messed up and he was exhausted. He was taken away to a farm, never to see his home again.
Sadly, Peter's story did not have a happy ending. He was never able to go back home.
