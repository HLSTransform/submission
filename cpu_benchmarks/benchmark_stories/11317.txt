The sun was shining brightly and it made Tommy smile. he wanted to go play outside, so he put on his running shoes and went out into the backyard. He could feel the soft grass tickle his feet and he started to jog around the garden. His dad saw him and smiled. He said "Look at you little man, giving it your best!" and Tommy giggled. 
Tommy loved going outside and he thought of new ways to play each time. This time, he decided to make jam. He picked some strawberries and put them in a bowl with a delicious spoonful of sugar. His dad saw what he was doing and shouted "That looks delicious Tommy!" Tommy was delighted and he quickly mixed the mixture into a jam. 
He took his jam to a delicious picnic outside. As he was jogging home, he saw his friends making some clay animals. Tommy gave them some of the jam and they all smiled. "That's so delicious," one of them said. Tommy smiled proudly. He had made his own delicious jam and he was very proud.
