Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to watch movies with her mom and dad. One day, they went to the cinema to see a movie about a mighty superhero.
During the movie, Lily's dad whispered to her, "Do you like the movie, Lily?" 
Lily shook her head and said, "No, I hate it. It's too scary for me."
Her mom heard her and said, "It's okay, Lily. We can leave if you don't like it."
Lily smiled and said, "Yes, please. I want to go home now." 
From that day on, Lily learned that it's okay to not like something and to speak up about it. She also learned that there are many other movies to watch that she might enjoy more.
