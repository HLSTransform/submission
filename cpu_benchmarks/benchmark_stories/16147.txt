Once upon a time there lived a little boy called Bob. Bob loved to pretend and make-believe. One day, he asked his dad if they could play a game together. His dad said yes and they played a race.
Bob and his dad got ready for the race. First, the dad said "Ready, set, go!" and the race began. Bob ran fast and his dad ran too. Bob was so happy and so was his dad.
Most of the race was smooth, but there were a few places that were very rough! Bob and his dad had to tread carefully as they ran past these places.
In the end, Bob's dad won the race. His dad said to him ,"That was a great race. You did so well." Bob was so happy that he had made his dad proud of him.
Bob and his dad hugged and said goodbye. Bob said, "Let's play the race game again sometime!" His dad said, "Of course, Bob. I'll be ready."
