Mum was using the kitchen to make dinner. She was carefully handling a large plastic bowl. She was mixing together different ingredients to make a tasty soup.
"Why are you using the plastic bowl, Mum?" asked 3 year old Max. 
"It's the best material to use because it's flexible," Mum said.
Max thought about the different plastic objects around him. He bent a plastic cup and it twirled around in his hand. "Woah! It's so flexible!" 
Mum looked up from the counter and smiled. "Yes! It is. It's perfect for mixing soup." 
Max wanted to help too. He started pulling out all the plastic bowls from the cupboard and lining them up on the table. 
Mum finished stirring the soup with her plastic bowl and came over to see what Max was doing. She was pleased to see him engaged in some creative play.
"That's great Max," she said. "I'm glad you're learning how to use plastic to make things." 
Max was very proud of his work and grinned at Mum. She bent down and hugged him. They both laughed together.
