Once there was a brown bear. He loved to stretch and he was very good at it. Every day he would go outside and stretch his arms over his head and his legs out wide. It was his favorite thing to do.
One day while he was stretching, he saw a novel on the ground. It was a magical book and it had brown covers. He picked it up and opened it. Inside he found a story about a bear who loved to stretch! He was so excited and knew he had to go on an adventure.
So the brown bear stretched his legs and arms as high as he could and ran off as fast as his short legs could carry him. He ran for what seemed like forever, until he arrived at a big, brown castle. The magical novel told him that inside was a treasure.
When the brown bear walked through the entrance, he found a room filled with big, sparkling treasures! He stretched his arms wide and chose his favorite one. It was the ultimate reward for a bear who loved to stretch!
