Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty vase in her room that she loved very much. One day, her little brother came into her room and accidentally knocked over the vase. It broke into many pieces and Lily was very sad.
Lily's brother said sorry, but Lily didn't believe him. She was angry and thought he did it on purpose. She didn't feel safe with him in her room anymore. Her parents came to see what happened and saw the broken vase. They told Lily that accidents happen and that her brother didn't mean to break it.
Lily started to feel better and realized that accidents happen. She forgave her brother and they hugged. They promised to be more careful in each other's rooms from now on. Lily learned that it's important to forgive and that feeling safe is important too.
