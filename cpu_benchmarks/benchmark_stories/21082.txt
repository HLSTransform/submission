Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big box in the attic with many old things inside. They saw a candle that looked very pretty. It had a shiny holder and a long wick.
"Let's light the candle and see how it glows," Ben said. He took a match from the box and tried to strike it. But he did not know how to do it right. He burned his finger and dropped the match. "Ow, ow, ow!" he cried.
Lily saw what happened and felt sorry for her brother. She ran to get some water and a band-aid. She put the water on his finger and the band-aid over it. "Are you okay, Ben?" she asked.
Ben nodded and hugged his sister. "Thank you, Lily. You are very kind and wise. You know how to help me when I am hurt."
Lily smiled and said, "You are welcome, Ben. You are very brave and fun. You know how to make me laugh when I am bored."
They looked at the candle again and decided not to light it. They knew it was dangerous and they did not want to get hurt again. They passed the candle to each other and pretended it was a microphone. They sang songs and told jokes and had a good time. They were happy to have each other as twins.
