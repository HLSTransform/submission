Once upon a time there was a little girl called Anna. She did not know what to do one day so she decided to go on an adventure. She went to stay in a fake house. It was made of cardboard and it was much too small for her to fit in.
Anna began to explore the fake house until she came to the door. But the door was stuck, so Anna started to pull and push to try and open it. Suddenly it swung open and Anna saw something she did not know existed - a secret garden! In the garden there were lots of flowers, buzzing bees and colourful butterflies. Anna was amazed at all of these things she did not know about before.
She stayed in the secret garden for a while, until the sun started to go down. Anna got a bit scared, so she ran back to her house and closed the door behind her.
She had had a wonderful adventure and she now knew about the secret garden. She was happy to have found it and now she knew how to get back there whenever she wanted to stay.
