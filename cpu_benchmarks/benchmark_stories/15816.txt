One day, a little girl was walking in the park. She was looking at all the pretty flowers and hearing the many sounds around her. She saw a very pretty butterfly and tried to catch it. As she reached out, it began to shrink! She couldn't believe it until she heard someone chuckle. She looked around and saw a very old man smiling. 
"You see," the man said. "The butterfly shrinks when you reach for it." 
The little girl looked at the old man, confused. 
"It's a magic trick," the man said. He waved his hand and the butterfly grew bigger! 
The girl smiled in amazement. She reached out again and the butterfly shrank. She pointed and laughed, happy to see the magical butterfly shrinking and growing again. 
The man said goodbye and the little girl waved as he walked away. She couldn't believe what she had seen and she told all her friends about it when she got home. She couldn't wait until she could go to the park again and show them the magical, pretty little butterfly!
