Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play and eat carrots all day long. But one day, Benny got sick and started to sneeze a lot. His mommy bunny told him that he needed to rest and exercise to feel better.
Benny didn't like to exercise, but his mommy bunny showed him how to hop and run around. It was impressive how much energy she had! Benny tried to do the same, and soon he was having fun while he exercised.
After a few days of rest and exercise, Benny felt much better. He realized that taking care of his body was important, and he promised to exercise every day. From that day on, Benny was a healthy and happy bunny who loved to play and eat carrots even more. The moral of the story is that exercise and rest are important for our bodies to be happy and healthy.
