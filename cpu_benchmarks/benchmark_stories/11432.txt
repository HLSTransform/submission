Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She was walking in the woods with her mom. Mia got so excited from all the animals she saw that she started running.
Mom said, "Mia, slow down! You're too fast!" 
Mia could see a river in the distance, and she asked her mom if they could go there. 
Mom said, "Yes, but don't go too fast. I don't want you to get hurt."
Mia and mom walked to the river and Mia stared in amazement. She wanted to touch the river but she was scared. Mom said, "It's ok Mia. I'll be here with you if you want to dip your toes in the river."
Mia smiled, held onto her mom's hand and stepped into the river. It felt so cool and refreshing. Mia laughed and said, "I'm not scared anymore!" 
Mia and mom played in the river until sunset and then walked home. Mom hugged Mia and said, "Remind me never to speed around here again!" 
Mia giggled and said, "Ok, mom!"
