Ben and Lily liked to play with their toy boats in the bathtub. They pretended they were sailors and went on adventures. They made waves with their hands and splashed water.
One day, Ben had a new idea. He said to Lily, "Let's sail to the faucet. Maybe there is a treasure there." Lily nodded and followed him. They pushed their boats towards the shiny metal thing.
But when they got close, they heard a loud noise. The faucet turned on and water gushed out. Ben and Lily were scared. They tried to turn back, but the water was too strong. Their boats flipped over and sank.
"Help, help!" they cried. "We are going to drown!"
Mom heard their screams and ran to the bathroom. She saw the mess and quickly turned off the faucet. She lifted Ben and Lily out of the tub and wrapped them in towels.
"Are you okay, my darlings?" she asked. "What were you doing?"
"We were sailing to the faucet, Mom," Ben said. "But it was a trap. It tried to eat us."
Mom hugged them and kissed their heads. "Oh, you silly sailors. The faucet is not a treasure. It is just for water. And it is not a trap. It is just a switch. You have to be careful with it. It can be dangerous."
"I'm sorry, Mom," Lily said. "We won't do it again."
Mom smiled and said, "It's okay, my loves. I'm glad you are safe. Next time, let's sail to the sink. It is more fun and less wet."
