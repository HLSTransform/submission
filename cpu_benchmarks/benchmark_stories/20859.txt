Dave went to the park. He saw something slimy in the grass. It was a snake! 
Dave was scared but he slowly walked closer. He saw it was a disgusting snake so he pushed it away with his foot. 
The snake was not happy. It wriggled and slithered across the ground. Dave didn't like it and he ran away, but the snake followed him. 
Dave shouted for help. Luckily, his mum was nearby and heard him. She ran over and pushed the snake away. It slithered off and Dave was safe. He was very happy.
