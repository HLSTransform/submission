Once upon a time there was a patch of land. The patch of land was boring and nothing ever happened there. One day, three friends, Sarah, Joe and Lucy, came to visit the patch.
Joe said to the others, “Let’s make this patch fun!” Sarah and Lucy agreed, so they started thinking of ways to make the patch more interesting.
Then Sarah had an idea. She said, “Let’s make a game!” Joe and Lucy liked the idea and they quickly began to plan.
The game involved everyone standing on the patch and supporting each other. Every time someone fell, the others had to propped them back up. Soon everyone was laughing and having lots of fun in the patch.
Using their imaginations, Sarah, Joe and Lucy had made the patch exciting and full of life. From then on, whenever the three friends were bored, they would return to their patch and support each other until they were entertained again!
