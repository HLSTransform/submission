Sara and Tom were playing in the park. They saw a big bird on a tree. The bird was brown and had a long beak. Sara thought the bird was ugly.
"Look, Tom, an ugly bird!" Sara said.
Tom looked at the bird. He did not think the bird was ugly. He thought the bird was interesting.
"No, Sara, not ugly. The bird is different. I want to see it closer," Tom said.
He walked to the tree. He wanted to touch the bird. The bird saw Tom. The bird did not like Tom. The bird made a loud noise. The bird flew away.
"Tom, come back! The bird is angry!" Sara said.
Tom ran back to Sara. He was sad. He wanted to be friends with the bird.
"Sorry, Sara. I like the bird. I want to say please to the bird. Maybe the bird will come back," Tom said.
Sara hugged Tom. She was sorry too. She did not want to hurt Tom's feelings.
"OK, Tom. We can say please to the bird. Maybe the bird will like us. But we have to be careful. The bird is big and strong," Sara said.
They looked at the tree. They hoped the bird would come back. They said please to the bird. They waited.
