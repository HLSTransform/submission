Sara and Ben are playing in the park. They like to swing and slide and run. They see a big tree with a hole. They go to look inside the hole.
Inside the hole, they find a paper. The paper has words on it. Sara and Ben do not know the words. They stare at the paper. They wonder what it says.
A man comes to the tree. He sees Sara and Ben with the paper. He looks angry and scared. He has a pale face. He runs to them and grabs the paper.
"Give me that! It's mine!" he yells. "It's a message. A secret message. You can't see it!"
Sara and Ben are scared too. They let go of the paper. They run away from the man. They go back to the swing and slide and run. They do not want to see the man or the paper again. They do not like the message. They do not like the pale face.
