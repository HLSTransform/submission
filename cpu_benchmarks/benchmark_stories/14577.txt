Once there was a boy called Ben. He was three years old and liked to explore his world. One day, he was playing at the beach when he decided to turn a big rock over. Under the rock was a broken shell. It was wet from the ocean water. Ben picked up the broken shell and looked at it closely. He thought it was the most beautiful shell he had ever seen. He put it carefully in his pocket. He wanted to take it home and show his mum. When he turned around to go home, he saw a big wave coming. It was so huge! Ben screamed and ran. But it was too late, the wave caught him and he got very wet. Luckily, Ben was safe and eventually made his way back home. He showed his mum the broken shell and it made them both happy. They laughed and hugged. Ben knew that he had found something special.
