One day, a small boy found a box with some chocolate inside. He was so excited that he shook it with all his might! Inside the box, he could see lots of little pieces of chocolate. He picked one out and it was the perfect size for him to eat. 
The small boy ran back to his house to show his parents what he had found. He shook the box and his parents smiled when they saw how excited he was. He offered all his family a piece of the chocolate and they all said it was delicious! 
The small boy went back to the same spot every day to look for chocolate. He shook every box he could find, but he only ever found one piece of chocolate each time. He continued doing this until one day, he found two! 
He was so excited that he gave a piece to each person in his family. Everyone was so happy and grateful that he was so kind. The small boy enjoyed the chocolate so much and smiled with delight. 
From that day, he visited the same spot every day to try and find more chocolate. He shook boxes, small and big, and every time he found some, he shared it with everyone he knew.
