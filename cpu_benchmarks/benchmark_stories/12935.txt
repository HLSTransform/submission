Once upon a time, there was a little pig. She was very alert and one day, she decided to go for a walk. As she was walking, she smelled something funny and she started to sneeze.
"Oh, What is that smell?" the little pig wondered. 
Just then a bee flew past her, barely an inch away from her nose! 
"Bzzzzz!" said the bee.
The little pig got a fright, but she stayed alert. She watched as the bee flew away, and as she did, she smiled and waved goodbye.
And that was the day the little pig learned why it's important to stay alert when you're out and about in the world!
