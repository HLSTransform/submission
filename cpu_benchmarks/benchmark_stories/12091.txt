Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw an ant walking on the ground. The ant was very small and had six legs.
Lily said to the ant, "Hello little ant! You are so tiny and cute. I promise not to step on you." The ant replied, "Thank you, Lily. You are very kind."
Suddenly, Lily saw a brilliant butterfly flying in the sky. She ran after it and shouted, "Wow, look at that beautiful butterfly!" The ant said, "Yes, it is very pretty."
Lily and the ant became friends and they promised to always be kind to each other. From that day on, Lily always watched where she walked so she wouldn't step on any ants.
