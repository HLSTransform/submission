Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to travel. She had a big red balloon, and she thought it was a fun idea to travel with her balloon. 
So, she took off and started to fly around the world. The sky was so blue and she saw lots of new and exciting sights. 
But then, she realized that her balloon was starting to get smaller and the strings felt very loose. She knew she wouldn't be able to travel very far if she kept going.
So, she landed and decided to take a break. She noticed that she had made a mistake, and so she thought very hard to come up with a better idea. 
She decided to get a basket and some feathers, and she made herself a red bird costume. With the costume, she was able to keep traveling with strong feathers that kept her airborne. 
The little girl had learned an important lesson. It's important to be careful when you are traveling because sometimes an idea that looks fun at first can be a bad one.
