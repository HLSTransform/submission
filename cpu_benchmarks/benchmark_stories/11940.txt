Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was a good dog. He loved to sleep on his owner's bed. One day, Max's owner got a new ashtray. Max didn't know what it was, but he sniffed it anyway. It smelled bad, so he decided to stay away from it.
Max was a loyal dog. He always followed his owner around the house. One night, Max's owner couldn't sleep. She tossed and turned in bed. Max noticed this and jumped up on the bed. He cuddled up next to her and licked her face. This made his owner feel better and she fell asleep.
The next day, Max's owner gave him a treat for being such a good dog. Max wagged his tail and licked her hand. He was happy to make his owner feel better. From that day on, Max slept on his owner's bed every night. He was a loyal companion and always there to help his owner when she needed him.
