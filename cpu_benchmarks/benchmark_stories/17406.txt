Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big, green frog on a rock. Tom wanted to touch it, but Lily was scared.
"Look, a frog!" Tom said. "I want to touch it with my finger."
"No, Tom, don't!" Lily said. "It is scary. It might jump or bite you."
Tom did not listen. He walked to the rock and reached out his finger. The frog did not move. Tom touched it softly. It felt wet and slimy.
"See, it is not scary," Tom said. "It is just a frog. Do you want to touch it too?"
Lily shook her head. She did not want to touch the frog. She thought it was ugly and gross.
"Come on, Lily, it is fun," Tom said. "It will not hurt you. It is just a frog."
Lily took a step closer. She looked at the frog. It blinked its big, black eyes. Lily felt brave. She reached out her finger too. She touched the frog gently. It felt wet and slimy.
"Wow, it is not scary," Lily said. "It is just a frog. It is kind of cute."
Tom and Lily smiled. They liked the frog. They touched it some more. The frog croaked. Tom and Lily laughed. They made friends with the frog.
