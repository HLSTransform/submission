Anna and Ben are playing in their room. They have many toys, but they like the phone best. The phone is old and does not work, but they pretend to call their friends and family.
"Hello, is this Lily?" Anna whispers into the phone. She holds it to her ear and smiles.
"Yes, this is Lily. How are you, Anna?" Ben whispers back. He is hiding under the bed with the other end of the phone.
"I am good, Lily. I am playing with Ben. He is my brother. Do you want to play with us?" Anna whispers.
"Sure, I want to play with you. What are you playing?" Ben whispers.
"We are playing phone. We can talk to anyone we want. It is fun. Do you have a phone, Lily?" Anna whispers.
"No, I don't have a phone. But I have a doll. She is clean and pretty. Do you have a doll, Anna?" Ben whispers.
"Yes, I have a doll. She is clean and pretty too. Her name is Rose. Do you want to see her, Lily?" Anna whispers.
"Yes, I want to see her. Can you show me, Anna?" Ben whispers.
"Okay, Lily. Wait a minute. I will get her for you." Anna whispers. She puts down the phone and runs to her closet. She opens the door and looks for her doll.
But she does not see her doll. She sees something else. Something big and furry and scary. It is a bear! The bear growls and shows its teeth. Anna screams and slams the door.
"Anna, what is wrong? What did you see?" Ben whispers. He crawls out from under the bed and runs to Anna. He hugs her and tries to calm her down.
"Ben, there is a bear in the closet! A big, bad bear! It wants to eat us!" Anna whispers. She is shaking and crying.
"A bear? In the closet? Are you sure, Anna?" Ben whispers. He does not believe her. He thinks she is joking.
"Yes, I am sure, Ben. I saw it with my eyes. It is not a joke. It is real. We have to call for help!" Anna whispers. She picks up the phone and dials a number.
"Hello, is this Mommy?" Anna whispers into the phone. She hopes Mommy will hear her and come to save them.
But Mommy does not hear her. Mommy is downstairs, cooking dinner. She does not know that Anna and Ben are playing with the phone. She does not know that there is a bear in the closet. She does not know that Anna and Ben are in trouble.
