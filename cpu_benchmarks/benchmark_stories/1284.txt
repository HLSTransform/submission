Once upon a time, there was a cute, little puppy. He was the most adorable puppy in the world. He had fluffy fur and always tried to be very good.
One day, he was running around the yard when he found a leak in the garden hose. He wanted to help, so he tried to wash it. He licked it with his big tongue and then splashed water from the lake onto it.
The leak was so happy to be washed, he started singing and giggling. He was so happy to be clean, he decided he wanted to stay there forever.
The little puppy was so proud of himself. He had cleaned the leak, and made it happy. He knew he had done a good job, and he felt very proud. He wagged his tail and ran back home to tell his family about his adventure.
