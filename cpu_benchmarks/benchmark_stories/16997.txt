Lily wanted to play with her new doll. It had a pink dress with a zip on the back. She liked to zip and unzip the dress. It was her original doll, not like the others.
But her brother Max wanted to play with it too. He said it was his turn. He tried to grab the doll from Lily's hands. Lily said no. She did not want to share.
"Mom, Lily won't allow me to play with the doll!" Max shouted. He was angry and sad.
Mom came to see what was wrong. She saw Lily and Max fighting over the doll. She said, "Stop, both of you. Why are you fighting?"
"Because Lily won't allow me to play with the doll!" Max repeated.
"But it's Lily's original doll. She got it for her birthday. She can decide who plays with it." Mom said.
"But I want to play with it too! It has a zip!" Max said.
Mom thought for a moment. She said, "How about this? Lily, you can play with the doll for ten minutes. Then you have to allow Max to play with it for ten minutes. And then you can take turns. Is that fair?"
Lily nodded. She said, "Okay. But only if Max is careful with the zip. It might break."
Max nodded too. He said, "Okay. I will be careful. Thank you, Lily."
Mom smiled. She said, "Good. Now you can play nicely together. And remember to say please and thank you."
Lily and Max agreed. They stopped fighting and started playing. They both liked the doll with the zip. It was original and fun.
