Once there was a little girl named Daisy and a robot named Blake. Daisy was very bossy and she always wanted things her way.
One day, Daisy and Blake decided to explore the jungle together. They had lots of fun and then, before they went back home, they came across a huge tree. They saw something strange and sparkly hovering around it. When they asked what it was, it said it was a spirit. 
The spirit told Daisy and Blake that it was tired of being so lonely and that it wanted to come home with them. Daisy was very excited and wanted to take the spirit home with her. Blake wasn't so sure but Daisy demanded that the spirit followed them. 
So the spirit followed Daisy and Blake back to Daisy's house. When Daisy's parents found out about the spirit, they were very angry. Daisy had tried to steal the spirit! Daisy quickly realized her mistake and apologized to her parents. 
The moral of the story is that it is never good to be too bossy. If we only think about ourselves and not about others, it can cause trouble for everyone.
