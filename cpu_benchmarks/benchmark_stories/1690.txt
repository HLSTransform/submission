Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, Lily woke up and felt a sharp pain in her tooth. She went to her mommy and said, "Mommy, my tooth hurts." 
Mommy said, "Let me take a look." She saw that Lily's tooth was wiggly and ready to come out. Mommy said, "Don't worry, your tooth will fall out soon." 
Later that day, Lily went to play with her friend Max. Max was being bossy and wanted to play his way. Lily said, "No Max, let's play my game." Max said, "No, we'll play my game." 
Lily didn't like how Max was acting, so she rushed home to her mommy. She told her mommy what happened and mommy said, "It's okay, Lily. Max was being bossy. You can play your game with someone else." 
Lily felt better and went to find someone else to play with. Her tooth was still hurting, but she knew it would fall out soon. And she was happy because she didn't have to play with a bossy friend.
