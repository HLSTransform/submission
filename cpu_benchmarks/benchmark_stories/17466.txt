Sam and Mia are playing in the backyard. They have a lot of equipment to have fun. They have a ball, a bike, a slide, and a hose. Sam likes to spray water with the hose. He thinks it is funny to make things wet.
"Look, Mia, I can spray the ball!" Sam says. He turns on the hose and points it at the ball. The water hits the ball and makes it roll away.
"Wow, Sam, you are strong!" Mia says. She claps her hands and laughs. She likes to see the ball move.
"Thank you, Mia. Do you want to try?" Sam asks. He gives the hose to Mia. Mia takes the hose and tries to spray the ball. But the hose is too heavy for her. She drops the hose and the water sprays everywhere.
"Oops, Mia, you made a mess!" Sam says. He runs to pick up the hose. He turns off the water and puts the hose away.
"Sorry, Sam. The hose is too big for me. I need a smaller one." Mia says. She looks sad.
"It's okay, Mia. Don't be sad. We can play with something else. How about the bike?" Sam says. He smiles and hugs Mia.
"Okay, Sam. I like the bike. Let's go!" Mia says. She smiles and hugs Sam back.
They leave the wet ball and the hose behind. They run to the bike and hop on. They pedal fast and have fun. They are good friends. They like to play together.
