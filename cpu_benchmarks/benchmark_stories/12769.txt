Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jack. He went on a boat trip to visit a huge island. He saw lots of animals on the way. He snapped pictures to remember the trip.
Jack arrived on the island and saw how huge it was. He said, "Wow, this island is so huge and beautiful!"
Then he realised he was lost. He thought and thought. Suddenly, he heard a loud snap. He turned around and saw a giant elephant. Jack said, "Hello there! Can you help me get back to my boat?"
The elephant smiled and kindly answered, "Yes! Just follow me and I will show you the way back to your boat."
So Jack followed the giant elephant. The elephant showed him the way and soon he was back on his boat. Jack thanked the elephant and waved goodbye before they both sailed away.
