Once there was a chubby girl called June. She was three years old. Every day, June would go outside to play. One day, June found a fun game. She wanted to play but she couldn't figure it out.
June's mom saw her looking confused. She asked June what was wrong. June said, "I want to play but I don't know how". Mom said, "It's ok, why don't we work together and see if we can figure it out?"
June and her mom worked together and eventually they solved the game. June was so happy that she jumped up and down. She could not stop smiling.
June and her mom played the game together every day and they had lots of fun. June loved her chubby cheeks because they made her smile even wider when she was playing.
