Lily and Ben were very happy. They were going to the city with Mom and Dad. They had never seen the city before. They wanted to see the big buildings, the cars, the people, and the park.
"Are we there yet?" Lily asked.
"Soon, sweetie," Mom said. "Look, you can see the city from here. Do you see the green park in the middle?"
Lily and Ben looked out the window. They saw the city. It was very big and shiny. They saw the green park. It had trees and grass and flowers. They saw a big pond with ducks and swans.
"Wow!" Ben said. "Can we go to the park, please?"
"Of course," Dad said. "That's where we're going. I have a surprise for you there."
Lily and Ben wondered what the surprise was. They were very excited. They hoped it was something fun.
They arrived at the park. Dad parked the car. Mom took out a basket. They walked to a nice spot under a tree. They spread a blanket on the grass. They had a picnic. They ate sandwiches, cookies, and fruit. They drank juice. They were very happy.
"Are you ready for your surprise?" Dad asked.
"Yes, yes, yes!" Lily and Ben said.
Dad smiled. He reached into the basket. He took out two boxes. He gave one to Lily and one to Ben.
"Open them," he said.
Lily and Ben opened the boxes. They gasped. Inside each box was a toy. Lily received a doll. Ben received a car. They were the toys they had wished for.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!" Lily and Ben said. They hugged Mom and Dad.
"You're welcome, sweeties," Mom and Dad said. "We're glad you like them. We love you very much."
Lily and Ben played with their toys. They had a lot of fun. They also fed the ducks and swans. They ran and laughed. They had a wonderful day at the park. They were very happy.
