Once upon a time there was a gifted girl named Jane. Jane was always very positive, and she hoped for the best in life. 
One day, she was walking through the woods near her home when she saw a small bird, who had hurt its wing. She knew what she had to do, and reached over and carefully picked the bird up.
"Don't worry," she said to the bird, "I'm going to help you."
Jane carefully rubbed some oil on the bird's wing, stroking him gently and talking kindly. The bird cooed thankfully. 
Soon, the wing was healed and the bird flew off. Jane was very happy, and she watched as the bird disappeared over the horizon with hope in her heart. 
The bird was gone, but the warmth from the oil and the love in Jane's voice still linger in the air.
