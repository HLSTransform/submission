Once upon a time there was a friendly frog who lived in a swamp. He loved hopping around in the swamp and his frog friends would often come to join him.
One day, the frog got an urge to explore and he hopped away, far away from his home. He hopped and hopped until he reached a mysterious village.
The frog was so excited to explore the village but as he hopped around, he soon realized that all the people were looking at him. It made him feel very embarrassed.
Suddenly, the frog didn't feel so brave. He wanted to go back to his swamp where he was always safe and comfortable. He quickly hopped back through the village and soon he was back in his swamp. He was so glad to be home!
