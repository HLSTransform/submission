Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. They saw a big hill with some trees and bushes. Ben had an idea.
"Let's go to the hill and pretend it is a castle," he suggested. "We can be the king and the queen and have a lot of fun."
Lily nodded and followed Ben. They climbed the hill and found a nice spot to sit. They looked at the sky and the birds and the flowers. They felt happy and safe.
But then they heard a loud roar. It came from behind the bushes. They saw a big, dark shape with red eyes and sharp teeth. It was a monster! It looked angry and hungry. It wanted to eat them!
Ben and Lily were scared. They jumped up and ran down the hill. The monster chased them. It was fast and rough. It snapped its jaws and swiped its claws.
"Help! Help!" Ben and Lily shouted. "There is a monster!"
Some people heard them and came to see. They saw the monster and were surprised. It was not a real monster. It was a big, black dog. It had a red collar and a tag. It was not angry and hungry. It was playful and friendly. It wanted to play with them.
The dog's owner came and called it. He apologized to Ben and Lily and the people. He said the dog was harmless and just escaped from his leash. He said he was sorry for scaring them.
Ben and Lily calmed down. They realized the dog was not a monster. They felt silly and relieved. They petted the dog and said hello. The dog licked them and wagged its tail. It was a nice dog.
They went back to the hill and continued their game. They were not afraid anymore. They had a new friend. They named the dog Monster. They laughed and had fun.
