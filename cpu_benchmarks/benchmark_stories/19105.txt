Once upon a time, there was a butterfly named Bella. Bella was very pretty and flew around the garden all day. She had bright colors and was very graceful. One day, Bella flew into a chamber in the garden. It was dark and scary, and she didn't like it. Suddenly, Bella disappeared! Her friends looked for her but couldn't find her anywhere. They were very sad. But then, Bella reappeared! She had flown out of the dark chamber and was back in the garden with her friends. They were so happy to see her again!
