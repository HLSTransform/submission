Today, Tony and his family went to the park to play. Tony wanted to have a lot of fun, so he didn't behave himself. He ran around and made too much noise.
When Tony's mom told him to stop, Tony started to throw a tantrum. Suddenly, Tony's dad brought out a lime. Tony was excited and stopped throwing his fit.
The lime was very tough and Tony's dad showed him how to peel it. When Tony peeled it, the lime's juice squirted in his face. Tony laughed and laughed. Everyone was glad Tony was behaving much better.
Afterwards, Tony enjoyed the juicy lime. He behaved well and had lots of fun.
