Jimmy and his mommy were in the park one sunny day, throwing a ball around. Every time Jimmy caught the ball, he gave it a big kick for fun.
"Wow, look at how hard you can kick it!" said mommy.
Jimmy smiled proudly, because he loved to show off the new skill he was learning.
Just then, a pastel balloon floated by them. Its color looked really cool against the bright blue sky.
"There!" Jimmy said, pointing to the balloon. "I want to kick it!"
Mommy smiled and said, "Ok, go ahead. But be careful, it looks icy!"
Jimmy laughed as he ran after the balloon and gave it a mighty kick.
The balloon flew away and Jimmy cheered with joy!
