Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and jump on the steps of her porch. One day, her mommy came outside and said, "Lily, let's go to the park!" Lily was so excited and her smile increased even more.
At the park, Lily saw her friend Max. Max was sad because he lost his favorite toy. Lily said, "Don't worry Max, we can help you find it!" They looked all around the park and finally found Max's toy on a step by the slide. Max was so happy and his smile increased too.
After they found the toy, they all played together and had so much fun. Lily's mommy said it was time to go home, but Lily and Max wanted to stay and play more. Lily's mommy said, "Okay, we can stay for five more minutes." Lily was so happy that they got to play a little longer. When it was time to go, Lily said goodbye to Max and her smile increased even more because she had such a fun day.
