Ben likes to play with his hat. He has a red hat with a star on it. He puts it on his head and runs around the yard. He feels good and happy.
One day, he sees a big dog on the street. The dog is brown and furry. It has a collar with a bell. Ben likes dogs. He wants to pet the dog. He urges his mom to let him go.
"Mom, mom, can I go to the dog?" he asks. "Please, please, please?"
Mom looks at the dog. She does not know the dog. She does not know if the dog is nice or mean. She shakes her head.
"No, Ben, you can't go to the dog. The dog is not ours. The dog may bite you. You have to stay here with me."
Ben feels sad and mad. He does not want to stay. He wants to go to the dog. He thinks the dog is good and friendly. He takes off his hat and throws it on the ground.
"No, no, no!" he yells. "I want to go to the dog! I want to go to the dog!"
Mom picks up the hat and puts it back on Ben's head. She hugs him and kisses him.
"Ben, I know you like dogs. But you have to be careful. Not all dogs are good. Some dogs are bad. They can hurt you. You have to ask the owner first. You have to be safe. Do you understand?"
Ben nods. He understands. He still likes dogs. But he loves his mom more. He says sorry to his mom. He says sorry to his hat. He smiles and hugs his mom back.
"OK, mom. I'm sorry. I love you. I love my hat. Can we go home and play with my hat?"
Mom smiles and nods. She loves Ben. She loves his hat. She says yes. They go home and play with the hat. They feel good and happy.
