Once upon a time, there was a pony named Bob. Bob was a friendly pony and loved to explore. He always liked to find new things and take on new adventures.
One day, Bob was out exploring when he came across a rough field. He wanted to explore what was in the field, but it was too rough. The ground seemed so bumpy and it was hard for Bob to keep his footing. All Bob wanted to do was to fill the field with soft grass.
He worked hard, but it was no use â€“ the ground was still too rough for Bob. He was about to give up when he heard a voice speaking. It told him to use the soft sand from the river to fill the rough ground in the field.
Bob was so excited and he quickly ran to the river and scooped up the sand. He filled the rough field with the soft sand, and soon he was able to explore the field as he wanted to! Bob was so happy that he danced and played in the field. From then on, Bob had a big, soft field to explore.
