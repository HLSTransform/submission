Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine and pick flowers. One day, she found a special herb growing in her garden. It smelled so good! She decided to pick some and hang it up to dry.
Lily's mom was very happy to see her daughter being so healthy and active. She gave her a big hug and a kiss. Lily felt very loved. She hung the herb up in her room and waited for it to dry. 
The next day, Lily's mom helped her make some tea with the dried herb. It tasted so yummy and made them both feel very healthy. Lily was so proud of herself for finding the herb and hanging it up. She knew she would always remember this special day.
