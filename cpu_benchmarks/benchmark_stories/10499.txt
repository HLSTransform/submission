Jimmy was a generous three year old. He liked to give so much that he often gave away all of his toys. One day, Jimmy saw his sister in the bathroom. He felt generous and he wanted to give her something, so he decided to poke her with his finger.
Jimmy's sister was not happy. She yelled at him and said: "Why would you do that?".
Jimmy said: "Because I wanted to give you something. I thought it was a nice thing to do."
But his sister was still mad, so she said: "That was not nice! Don't do it ever again!"
Jimmy felt sad and he didn't understand why his sister was so mad. He thought he was being generous, but it didn't turn out like he had wanted. He would be more careful in the future.
