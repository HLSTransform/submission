Once upon a time, there was a bald man who lived in a small house in the forest. He was very lonely because he never had visitors.
One day, he was sitting inside his house when he heard a loud noise outside. He opened his front door and saw a giant bear! The bear lay down right in front of the man's doorstep. The bald man was very scared, but then the bear said, "Welcome!"
The man was so surprised he couldn't move. He wondered why the bear was being so friendly. Then the bear said, "I heard you were alone, so I thought I'd come and brighten up your day!"
The bald man was so thankful, he offered the bear some food. The bear stayed for a while and the man and bear enjoyed each other's company.
The bear eventually had to go, but the man was no longer so lonely. He knew that no matter how alone he felt, he was always welcome in the forest.
