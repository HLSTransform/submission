Once upon a time, there was a big, hairy bear. The bear had a long, brown strip on his back. One day, the bear went to the forest to play with his friends. But when he got there, he saw that his friends were not there. The bear started to frown because he was sad. 
Then, the bear heard a noise. It was a little bird who had hurt her wing. The bear felt sorry for the bird and wanted to help her. He gently picked up the bird and took her to his home. The bear took care of the bird until she felt better. 
The bird was happy and grateful to the bear. She thanked him and flew away. The bear was happy too and he smiled. From that day on, the bear and the bird became good friends. They played together every day in the forest. The end.
