Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Ben. Ben was very sleepy because he had stayed up late playing with his toys. He wanted to take a nap but he was also thirsty. He decided to go to the kitchen to get some juice. 
As he was drinking the juice, he started to yawn. He knew it was time for his nap. He went back to his room and climbed into his cozy bed. He closed his eyes and fell asleep right away. 
When he woke up, he felt much better. He was no longer sleepy and he had lots of energy to play with his toys again. From then on, he made sure to go to bed early so he wouldn't feel sleepy during the day. The end.
