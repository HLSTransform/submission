Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She had a nice eraser that she loved to use. She would always erase her mistakes with it. One day, Lily's eraser disappeared. She looked everywhere for it, but it was nowhere to be found. She was very sad.
Lily asked her friends if they had seen her eraser, but they hadn't. She even asked her teacher, but she didn't know where it was either. Lily felt like she would never find her eraser again.
Days turned into weeks, and Lily still couldn't find her eraser. She started to feel angry and frustrated. Then one day, Lily saw her eraser in another girl's pencil case. Lily was so upset that she grabbed the eraser and ran away.
Lily's friends tried to stop her, but she didn't listen. She ran out of the classroom and into the street. Suddenly, a car appeared out of nowhere and hit Lily. She was hurt badly and had to go to the hospital. Lily learned that it's not nice to take things that don't belong to you, and that sometimes things disappear for a reason.
