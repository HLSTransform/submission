Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play outside. One day, it rains a lot. Lily and Ben are happy. They put on their boots and coats. They go to the park.
In the park, they see many puddles. Puddles are water on the ground. Lily and Ben jump in the puddles. They splash and laugh. They make big waves. They have fun.
A dog comes to the park. The dog is friendly. He wags his tail. He likes puddles too. He runs and jumps with Lily and Ben. He barks and licks them. They pet him. They make a new friend.
The dog's owner comes to the park. He is looking for his dog. He sees Lily and Ben. He smiles. He says thank you. He says his dog is called Spot. He says Spot likes to play with kids. He says he can provide a towel to dry them off. He says they can come to his house for a snack.
Lily and Ben say yes. They follow the owner and Spot. They dry off and eat cookies. They play with Spot some more. They are happy. They have a good day.
