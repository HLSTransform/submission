Once upon a time there lived a family with two kids, Alex and Julia. They lived on the beach and had a sand castle for home. Every day their dad would raise the flag on their castle and the kids loved it.
One day, a special thing happened. Off in the horizon a ship appeared and it was carrying a crown! Alex and Julia ran to it and their dad knew right away what it was. "It's a rare crown," he said. "And I'm going to raise it on our flag pole so everyone can see it!" The kids were thrilled.
But the next morning, the crown was gone! Alex and Julia were sad. Then their dad explained why it had disappeared. "The crown was not ours," he said. "We must always remember that some things are too special to keep."
Alex and Julia learned their lesson. "We will never take something that doesn't belong to us," said Alex. And from that day forward, they knew it was better to raise each other up, instead of taking away from someone else.
