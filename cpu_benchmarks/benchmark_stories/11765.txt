Once upon a time there was a family that loved to celebrate. One day, the family went for a walk through a park with a zigzag path. It was cold outside but the family bundled up in hats and coats. 
Suddenly, the father pointed at something in the sky, "Look, kids!" he said. It was a colorful kite flying up in the sky in a zigzag. "Let's celebrate!" he said, "And let's go zigzagging down the path." 
So they all zigzagged together through the park, giggling and laughing. Soon they were too warm in their winter coats and hats and had to take them off. 
At the end of the path, they celebrated with a big picnic. They ate yummy treats, sang songs, and even flew the kite. 
The family celebrated together at the end of the path and enjoyed the beautiful day.
