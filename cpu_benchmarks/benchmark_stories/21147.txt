Once upon a time, there was a big spaghetti named Dahlia. She was so big that she could fly high in the sky. Dahlia was so happy and loved to laugh and play with her friends.
One day she met another big spaghetti named Francis. He was also very big and could fly even higher in the sky. Dahlia and Francis made a plan to build a secret kingdom of the clouds. 
The two excitedly started flying high in the sky together to build the secret kingdom. All of a sudden, Francis stopped and wanted to take a break. 
Dahlia asked, "What's wrong?" Francis sadly replied, "I will have to go back soon and won't be able to help you build the kingdom anymore." 
Dahlia was so sad and started to weep. Francis hugged her tightly and said, "Don't worry, I promise I'll be back soon and help you build the kingdom together." Francis then flew away.
For many days, Dahlia waited and waited, but Francis never came back. Dahlia thought to herself, if only she had finished building the secret kingdom with Francis when she had the chance.
After a while, one sunny morning Dahlia looked up to the sky and suddenly saw a huge shadow in the clouds. It was Francis! Dahlia was so happy and quickly flew up to meet him. Together, they finished building the secret kingdom in the clouds.
