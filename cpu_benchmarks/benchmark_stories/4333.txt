Once upon a time there was a girl who loved fashion. Every day she liked to put on her pretty clothes. But she lived in an ugly town and none of her friends had nice things to wear.
One day, the girl had a bright idea. She decided to make her own fashion. She used bits of colourful cloth and decorated them with buttons. All of her friends thought it was wonderful.
The girl went on to make more of her own fashion. She made skirts, dresses and even hats. Her friends all asked for their own pieces, too.
Soon the girl became very famous. Everyone from the town wore her designs and people from other places came to see if they could buy some. She was very proud of her own fashion and everyone admired her. 
She had really turned ugly fashion into something beautiful.
