Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went to visit her aunt. Her aunt lived in a unique house that was very different from other houses. It was round and colorful, like a big ball.
One day, Lily and her aunt decided to decorate the house. They used paint, paper, and glue to make pretty pictures. They put the pictures on the walls and the house looked even more special.
Lily and her aunt had so much fun decorating the house. They laughed and played all day. When they were done, they looked at their beautiful work. Lily loved her aunt's unique house even more now, and she couldn't wait to visit again.
