Lily has a cat named Max. Max is a loyal cat. He likes to play with Lily and sleep on her bed. He also helps Lily when she is sad or scared.
One day, Lily and Max go to the park with Lily's mom. Lily sees a big slide and wants to try it. She climbs up the ladder and sits on the slide. But then she sees a big dog at the bottom. The dog is barking and showing his teeth. Lily is afraid of the dog. She does not want to slide down.
Max sees that Lily is afraid. He runs to the slide and jumps on it. He slides down very fast and lands on the dog. He uses his sharp claws and teeth to scare the dog away. The dog runs away, yelping.
Lily is very happy and proud of Max. She slides down and hugs him. She says, "Thank you, Max. You are a brave and loyal cat. I love you." Max purrs and licks her face. He loves her too.
Lily's mom sees what happened and smiles. She says, "You have a very special cat, Lily. He is a hero." She gives Max a treat and a pat. Lily and Max go home, happy and safe. They are the best friends.
