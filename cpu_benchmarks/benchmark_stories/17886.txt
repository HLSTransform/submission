One day, a boy was searching for something in his room. He looked around the room, but he couldn't find what he wanted. He was getting frustrated and started to feel fierce.
The boy got down on his hands and knees and looked where he hadn't looked before. He saw a drawer and thought that maybe his things would be inside. He grabbed the handle of the drawer and pulled it open. He searched inside the drawer and suddenly his face lit up with joy. He had found what he was looking for!
He pulled out a big, red toy car which he had been searching for. The boy hugged the car and smiled. He had found it after all!
