Once upon a time, there was a furry bunny named Benny. One day, Benny saw a cop marching down the street. "Hello, Mr. Cop!" said Benny. "Where are you going?"
"I'm going to the station," said the cop. "I have to help keep everyone safe."
Benny thought that was very important. "Can I come with you?" he asked.
"Of course," said the cop. "The more helpers, the better!"
So, Benny and the cop marched down the street together, keeping an eye out for any trouble. They felt very proud to be helping their community. From that day on, Benny knew that he could always count on the cop to keep him safe.
