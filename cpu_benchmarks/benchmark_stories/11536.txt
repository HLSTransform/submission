Once upon a time, there was a big, clean house. In the house, there was a pretty vase. The vase was very special to Mom. She loved it so much.
One day, a little girl named Lily played with her ball in the house. She wanted to be careful not to break the vase. But, her ball hit the vase and it fell. The vase broke into pieces. Lily was sad and scared. She did not want Mom to be mad at her.
Lily tried to fix the vase. She put the pieces back together. But, she could not do it. She started to cry. Her big brother, Tom, heard her and came to help. "What's wrong, Lily?" he asked. "I broke Mom's vase," she said. "I don't want her to be mad."
Tom hugged Lily and said, "It's okay. We can tell Mom what happened. She will be sad, but she will still love you." They went to find Mom and told her the truth. Mom was sad about the vase, but she loved Lily and Tom more. She hugged them and said, "Vases can be lost, but you two are more important to me."
