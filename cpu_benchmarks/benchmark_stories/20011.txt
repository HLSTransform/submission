Sara and Ben are playing in the garden. They have a big box of cards with pictures of animals on them. They want to match the cards that have the same animal.
"Look, I have a card with a bee!" Sara says, holding up a yellow and black card.
"Me too!" Ben says, showing his card. "Bees are adorable. They make honey and buzz around the flowers."
They put their cards together and smile. They have made a match.
"Let's find more matches!" Sara says, picking another card. "What animal is this?"
She shows Ben a card with a brown and white animal with horns and a long tail.
"That is a goat," Ben says. "Goats are funny. They eat grass and make noises like 'baa'."
"Do you have a goat card?" Sara asks.
Ben looks through his cards. He finds one with a goat, but it is different from Sara's. His goat is black and white, and has a beard.
"No, I don't have a match," he says. "My goat is not the same as your goat."
Sara and Ben look at their cards. They see that some animals have different colors or shapes, even if they are the same kind of animal.
"That's okay," Sara says. "We can still learn about the animals. Maybe we can find other ways to match them."
"Like what?" Ben asks.
"Like, we can match them by their sounds, or their homes, or their food," Sara says.
"That sounds fun!" Ben says. "Let's try it!"
They keep playing with their cards, matching the animals by different things. They learn a lot and have a lot of fun. They love playing with their cards and with each other.
