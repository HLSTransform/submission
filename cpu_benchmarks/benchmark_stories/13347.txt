Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max was very loyal to his owner, a little girl named Lily. Max loved to play with Lily and protect her from danger.
One day, Lily's mom brought home a big piece of meat for dinner. Max was so excited to smell the meat, but Lily's mom told him to stay away from it. Max was sad, but he knew he had to listen to Lily's mom.
Later that night, when Lily and Max were sleeping, Max heard a noise outside. He got scared and barked loudly to protect Lily. Lily woke up and saw that Max was being brave and loyal to her. She hugged Max and thanked him for keeping her safe. Max was happy that he could help and forgot all about the meat.
