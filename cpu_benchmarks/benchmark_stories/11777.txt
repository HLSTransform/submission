Once there was an old cell phone. It lived in a drawer far away. One day, it heard something bite in the kitchen. It wanted to see what was going on, so it crawled out of the drawer and went to the kitchen.
When it got there, it saw a little three year old child. He was taking bites out of an apple. The cell phone rolled closer and said, "Hello!"
The child was surprised to hear a voice coming from the old cell phone. He said, "Why are you talking?"
The cell phone giggled. "I want to be friends with you," it said.
The child smiled. From then on, he kept the old cell phone in his pocket and brought it everywhere. Whenever he needed a friend, he'd take the cell phone out of his pocket and it would make him smile.
