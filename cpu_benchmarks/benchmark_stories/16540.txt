Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with red fruits. Sam says, "Look, Mia, apples! Let's pick some. They are tasty."
Mia nods and follows Sam. They run to the tree and reach for the fruits. But the tree has sharp thorns. Sam and Mia hurt their hands. They cry, "Ow, ow, ow!"
A lady hears them and comes to help. She is kind and gentle. She says, "Oh, poor children. You picked the wrong tree. These are not apples. These are roses. Roses are pretty, but they have sharp thorns. They are not for eating. Come, let me clean your hands and give you a band-aid."
Sam and Mia say, "Thank you, lady. You are nice. We are sorry. We did not know."
The lady smiles and says, "It's okay. You are curious and brave. But next time, be careful. If you want apples, go to the east. There is an orchard there. The farmer lets children pick apples. They are tasty and juicy. Do you want to go?"
Sam and Mia nod and say, "Yes, please. We love apples. Can you show us the way?"
The lady says, "Sure. Follow me. I will take you to the east. And maybe, on the way, we can see some other things that are pretty and tasty. But not sharp."
