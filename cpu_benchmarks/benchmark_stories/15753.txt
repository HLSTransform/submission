Once upon a time there was an animal. It was big, and very smooth. The animal wanted to believe it could fly, so it jumped up high in the sky.
It said to itself, "I can do it, I can be free!" But no matter how hard it tried, it couldn't stay in the air.
Then, a small bird flew by. "What are you trying to do?" asked the bird.
The animal said, "I want to fly, just like you."
The bird smiled and said, "You can do it if you believe."
So the animal believed, and it tried one more time. This time it stayed up in the sky, soaring and floating along. 
The animal felt so happy and free. It thanked the bird for helping it believe. From that day on, the animal knew it could do anything if it just believed.
