Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to spin. She liked to spin in circles around and around until she was so dizzy she would fall to the ground in a fit of giggles. 
One day, she went for a walk and found a furry animal. The animal was clean and white and the little girl reached out to pet it. Immediately, the animal began to spin. "Oh my, what are you doing?" the girl asked. 
The animal laughed and kept spinning. "I'm spinning because it's fun!" it said. The girl smiled and shook her head. She decided to join in and spun around with the animal. They laughed and spun around and around until they were too dizzy to stand. 
The little girl decided to take the animal home.  She named him Fur and he became her best friend. The two of them still spin together, just for fun.
