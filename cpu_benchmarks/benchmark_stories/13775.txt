Lily and Max were playing in the garden. They liked to look for bugs and flowers. Lily had a magnifying glass. She used it to examine things closely.
"Look, Max, I found a worm!" Lily said. She held the magnifying glass over the worm. It was brown and slimy. It moved slowly in the dirt.
"Wow, let me see!" Max said. He took the magnifying glass from Lily. He looked at the worm too. He saw that it had many tiny legs. He counted them. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!" he said. "The worm has ten legs!"
"That's not a worm, Max. That's a centipede!" Lily said. She knew a lot about bugs. She had a book about them. She showed Max the picture of a centipede in the book. "See, it says here. A centipede has many legs. One for each inch of its body. It is a unique bug."
Max looked at the picture and then at the centipede. He saw that they were the same. He was amazed. He wanted to touch the centipede. He reached out his hand.
"Careful, Max. The centipede can bite!" Lily warned. She had read that in the book too. She grabbed Max's hand and pulled it back. "We can look, but we can't touch. The centipede is not a toy. It is a living thing. We have to be gentle and respectful."
Max nodded. He understood. He gave the magnifying glass back to Lily. They continued to play in the garden. They found more bugs and flowers. They examined them with curiosity and wonder. They learned new things and had fun. They were happy.
