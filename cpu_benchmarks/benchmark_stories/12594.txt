Once upon a time, there was a big, fat cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to sleep all day and eat lots of food. One day, Fluffy heard a noise outside. He went to the window and saw a fashion show happening on the street. He was so curious that he decided to go outside and see what was happening. 
When Fluffy got outside, he saw lots of people wearing pretty clothes and walking down a runway. He watched the fashion show for a while and then got tired. Fluffy went back home and took a nap. He dreamt about all the beautiful clothes he saw and wished he could wear them too. 
The next day, Fluffy woke up and decided to go on a diet. He didn't want to be fat anymore. He started eating healthy food and exercising more. After a few weeks, Fluffy lost some weight and felt much better. He was able to run and play more easily. And even though he couldn't wear the pretty clothes from the fashion show, Fluffy was happy with how he looked and felt.
