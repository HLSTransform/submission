Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big spirit and loved playing with her toys. One day, Lily's mommy took her to the park to play on the swings. But when they got there, Lily felt uncomfortable because the swings were too high.
Lily's mommy tried to make her feel better, and said, "Don't worry, Lily. I hope you can have fun on the swings soon!" Lily felt a little bit better and decided to try the swings. She closed her eyes and held on tight. As she swung back and forth, she felt her spirit lift and she started to smile. 
From that day on, Lily loved going to the park and playing on the swings. She was no longer uncomfortable and always had hope that she could have fun on the swings.
