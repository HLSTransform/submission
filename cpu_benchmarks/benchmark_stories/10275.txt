Once upon a time, there was a big truck. The truck needed fuel to go vroom vroom. The driver went to the gas station to fill up the tank. 
On the way back, the driver saw a rude man. The rude man tried to sack the driver's fuel. But the driver said "no way!" and drove away. 
The driver was happy he still had his fuel and could keep going. He drove and drove until he reached his destination. The end.
