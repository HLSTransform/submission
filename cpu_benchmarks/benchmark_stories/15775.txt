Once upon a time there was a dog named Bob. Bob was a very happy and playful dog. He was best friends with the little girl next door. 
Every day the little girl would come over and they would play together. One day they wanted to do something special. So they asked Bob what he wanted to do. 
"Let's paint!" Bob said.
The little girl and Bob went over to the back porch and laid out the paper and paint. The little girl was so excited and asked Bob, "What color?"
 Bob looked around, smiled and said, "Let's make it yellow, please!"
So the little girl grabbed the yellow paint and a brush and began to paint with Bob. They painted and painted until all the paper was covered in beautiful yellow! 
When they finished, they both smiled. They had made something special.
