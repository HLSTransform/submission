Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wander in the park with her mommy. One day, while they were walking, they saw a man playing guitar. Lily was eager to hear the music, so she asked her mommy if they could go closer. 
"Can we go listen to the guitar, mommy?" she asked. 
"Of course, Lily," her mommy replied. 
As they got closer, Lily could hear the beautiful music coming from the guitar. The man noticed them and smiled. "Would you like to hear a song?" he asked. 
Lily nodded eagerly and the man started playing a song just for her. She closed her eyes and swayed to the music, feeling happy and content. After the song was over, Lily thanked the man and they continued their wander in the park, humming the tune of the guitar.
