John was a 3 year old boy. He loved to run. Every morning, he liked to go outside and run around in the yard. On special days, his mom and dad would take him to the movies. He always felt so excited when he got to go and see a new movie.
John really liked the movies. One night, he saw a movie about a successful racehorse. The horse ran in a race and won! John thought it was so cool. He wanted to run like the horse in the movie.
John practiced running in the yard every day. He ran faster and faster until he was really good at running. He felt successful like the horse in the movie. He was so proud of himself. From then on, he kept running everyday. He loved the feeling of success.
