Once there was a human who was very brave. He wanted to do something daring. So he decided to go and pick some sour apples from a big apple tree. He was determined to pick the apples even though the tree was very tall.
But when he got close to the tree, he realized it was much bigger than he had thought and he was scared. He took a deep breath and started climbing up the tree. Slowly but surely he made it to the top.
When he looked around, he saw that the apples were indeed very sour. But he had promised himself that he would pick them, so he started picking the apples. He was careful not to fall off the tree while picking the apples.
Finally, he had managed to pick the most sour apples from the tree. Satisfied, he slowly climbed down and proudly showed everyone the apples he had gathered. Everyone praised him for his courage and for daring to pick the sour apples.
