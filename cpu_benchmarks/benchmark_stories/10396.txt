Pete was a playful boy. He liked to play with his bike. Every day, he would get on his bicycle, push down on the pedals, and ride around the neighborhood. He loved how fast he could go, and he would repeat this process over and over again.
When Pete's friends came over to play, they all started racing with their bikes. Pete could pedal faster than the others and he always won. His friends were so jealous, but they still had lots of fun. They would go around corners, up and down hills and through backyards. Pete was proud that he always came in first.
After the races were over, Pete still kept pedaling around the block. The wind in his hair felt so nice and he was having such a great time. He'd do this for an hour or two, over and over again. 
Pete pedaled until it was time to go home. Sooner or later, the sun started going down and it was time to say goodbye. He put his bike away and headed home, but he would repeat this fun experience again soon.
