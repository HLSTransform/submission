Adam was walking down the street. He felt nervous because the city was a new and strange place. All around him there were lots of people, and lots of big cars. Cars are called automobiles.
Adam wasn't sure where to go. He was getting more and more nervous. Then, a friendly man in a car stopped near him and asked, "Do you need help?"
Adam nodded. He knew that to nod means to say yes without words.
The kind man smiled. "Hop in and I'll take you where you need to go."
Adam was very happy. He smiled and climbed in to the automobile. Then, he sat back and relaxed. With a friendly nod from the man, he was soon on his way.
