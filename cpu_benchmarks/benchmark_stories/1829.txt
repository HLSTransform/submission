Jane was a young girl, who liked to pray. Every day she would kneel down and close her eyes and pray to God. She was very foolish and often asked for silly things in her prayers. 
One day, Jane prayed for a pet squirrel. While this was a very silly thing to pray for, that night a squirrel appeared in her back garden. 
Jane was so excited and ran to the garden to see her new pet. She wanted to pick it up, but she soon found out that it was very scared. Jane was sad because she wanted to give the squirrel a hug, so she thought of the best thing to do. 
Every night, Jane would kneel down and pray for the squirrel. She would ask that the squirrel would become her friend and feel safe in her garden. 
After a few weeks, the squirrel had got used to Jane. He would come out of the trees and eat peanuts out of her hand. Jane was so happy to see her prayers answered and she was no longer foolish in her prayers.
