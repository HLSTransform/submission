Once there was a little boy. He was only three years old. He saw a puppy lying in the grass. He was so helpless and alone. The little boy felt sorry for the pup. He got down onto the ground and lay down beside the pup. He looked into the pup's eyes and saw how sad it was. The little boy stroked its head and the puppy licked his hand. The two were now friends.
The little boy and the pup played together for hours. The pup followed the little boy everywhere he went. The pup was always so happy when the little boy was by his side. Eventually, it was time for the little boy to go home. He hugged the pup and said goodbye. He opened his eyes and to his surprise, the pup had followed him home!
The pup now lived with the little boy and his family. The little boy knew he had found a great friend in his helpless little pup. He loved taking care of it and playing with it. The pup always had a twinkle in its eyes and a big smile on its face when the little boy looked into its big, round pupils. They were the best of friends and would stay that way forever.
