One day, a big dog named Zip went to play with his friends. They were a group of dogs who loved to run and jump. Zip was very happy to see his friends.
The group of dogs played in the park. They ran up and down the hills. Zip was the fastest dog in the group. He loved to race his friends.
As the sun went down, the dogs were tired. Zip and the group of dogs went home. They had a fun day playing together in the park. Zip couldn't wait to play with his friends again.
