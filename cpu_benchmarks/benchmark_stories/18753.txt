Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a newspaper in the living room. They saw many pictures and words on it. They wanted to have fun with it.
"Look, Lily, I can match this picture with my car!" Tom said, tearing a piece of the newspaper.
"Me too, Tom, I can match this picture with my doll!" Lily said, tearing another piece.
They tore and matched more and more pieces, until the newspaper was all gone. They made a big mess on the floor.
Mom came home and saw the mess. She was not happy. She asked Tom and Lily, "What did you do with the newspaper?"
Tom and Lily looked at each other. They felt sorry. They said, "We were playing with it, Mom. We were matching the pictures with our toys."
Mom said, "I understand you wanted to play, but the newspaper was not a toy. It was Daddy's newspaper. He likes to read it every day. He was looking forward to it. Now he will be sad."
Tom and Lily felt bad. They said, "We are sorry, Mom. We did not know. We did not mean to make Daddy sad."
Mom said, "It's okay, Tom and Lily. I know you did not mean it. But you should always ask before you use something that is not yours. And you should always clean up your mess. That is how you show respect and care for others."
Tom and Lily nodded. They said, "We understand, Mom. We will ask next time. And we will clean up our mess. Can we help you?"
Mom smiled. She said, "Yes, you can. Thank you, Tom and Lily. You are sweet children. I love you."
Tom and Lily hugged Mom. They said, "We love you too, Mom. And we love Daddy. Can we say sorry to him?"
Mom said, "Of course, you can. He will be home soon. He will forgive you. He loves you too."
Tom and Lily waited for Daddy. They wanted to say sorry and give him a hug. They learned a lesson that day. They learned to be careful with other people's things. And they learned to be kind and honest.
