Once upon a time there was a bowl that was very important. It was blue and shiny and everyone wanted it.
One day, a little girl named Sarah saw the bowl. She was so excited that she ran to get it. She reached out and brought it to her home.
When the little girl went back to her mommy, she showed her the bowl. To her surprise, her mommy said, “That’s not your bowl, Sarah!” Sarah was very sad and started to cry.
Her mommy explained, “This bowl is very important and you can’t keep it. You must bring it back to where it belongs.”
Sarah had to bring the bowl back to where she found it. That made her very sad, but she knew it was the right thing to do.
The End.
