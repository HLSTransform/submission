Billy and his mom were eating breakfast one sunny morning. On the table was a plate of delicious toast, dripping with rich butter. Mom smiled while Billy hopped around the kitchen, singing a happy tune. 
“Billy, why don’t you sit down and enjoy your toast?” said Mom.
“But I feel too happy to sit still,” said Billy as he hopped around the table. 
Mom laughed and nodded. “That’s alright, but don’t forget to eat all of your delicious toast.”
Billy hopped over to the plate, picked up a slice, and smiled. The toast was warm and tasted rich and buttery. He finished the slice and then hopped around the kitchen again, singing his happy tune. 
Mom watched in delight. “It looks like that toast made you very happy!” she said.
Billy smiled and gave Mom a hug. “It sure did!” he said. “Thank you for this rich, delicious toast!”
