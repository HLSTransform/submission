Once upon a time there was a puppy named Max. He lived in a house with two kids, Alex and Lucy. Every day Lucy would take Max outside and they would go for a walk. She would put on his leash and wrap it around her hand so he wouldn't run away.
One day, Lucy and Max were walking when Max saw something in the woods. He pulled so hard on the leash and ran into the woods. Lucy ran after him, but she couldn't catch him. When she got to the woods, Max had already dug up someone's garden. He was covered in dirt and flower petals!
Lucy felt very guilty. "Max, we're in trouble now! We have to go home," she said.
The two walked home together, but they were both very scared. When they got home, Lucy and Max's dad was mad. He said that Max had disobeyed the rules and that he had to stay in the backyard for the rest of the day.
Max felt even worse, but Lucy gave him a big hug and told him it would be ok. They both knew that next time Max would have to stay on the leash.
