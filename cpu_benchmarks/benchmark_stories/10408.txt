Jim and Maya were playing together in the park. Jim asked Maya if they could get an ice cream. But Maya disagreed. She said she wanted to play with a small rubber stamp she had found. Jim wasn't sure about that, but he didn't want to disagree with Maya, so they both put a small stamp on the bench. They were both very happy and ran around the park, chasing each other and laughing. Suddenly, Jim saw an ice cream van. He stopped and asked Maya again. But this time, she was sure she didn't want an ice cream. She just wanted to play with her stamp. So Jim and Maya continued to play, and eventually, they both forgot about the ice cream.
