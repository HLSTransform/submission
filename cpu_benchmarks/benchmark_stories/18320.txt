Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin loved to swim in the ocean and explore new places. One day, Fin met a friendly crab named Claws. Claws warned Fin about the busy part of the ocean where big boats passed by.
Fin didn't listen to Claws and swam towards the busy part of the ocean. Suddenly, a big boat came and hit Fin. Fin was hurt badly and couldn't swim anymore. Claws tried to help Fin, but it was too late.
Fin's friends in the ocean were sad and missed him very much. They learned that it's important to listen to warnings and stay safe.
