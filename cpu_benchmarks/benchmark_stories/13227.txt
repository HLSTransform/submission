Once upon a time, there was a boy called Billy. He went on a big adventure to a university. He was so excited! He observed all the new things, from the big tall buildings to the people walking around.
Billy looked really tired after a day of observing. He noticed a park and decided to take a little rest. He lay down on the soft grass, feeling the sun shining down on him. He closed his eyes and fell fast asleep.
He dreamt that he was flying above the university, looking down at all the people and buildings. He felt like he could stay there forever!
When he woke up, he was happy and refreshed. He got up and looked around at all the new sights one last time before he went home.
Billy had had a wonderful day. He had seen so many new things and he had learnt lots too. He was happy and no longer tired. He had had a great adventure at the university.
