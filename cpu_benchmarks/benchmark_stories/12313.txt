Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lisa. Lisa loved going to festivals and every year when the festival came around she would get so excited! This time, the festival was especially special.
Lisa was with her mom and dad when she saw a big bright clown walking around. Lisa couldn't believe how funny he was. She laughed and clapped her hands in delight as he ran around doing silly tricks. 
Suddenly, the clown tripped and fell over. He was so clumsy! Lisa was a bit worried and quickly ran over to see if he was alright. But before she could reach him, he had got back up again. 
Lisa was happy to see that he was ok, but the clown didn't seem to think the same. He ran playfully towards her and said, "I'll get you for that!" and proceeded to give her a light slap on the back.
Lisa was so shocked! She wasn't sure what to do. Just then, her dad came up behind her and said in a stern voice, "Now now, no slapping at the festival!" 
The clown looked embarrassed and quickly ran away. Lisa smiled as she watched him go and looked back up at her dad with a relieved smile. From now on, she knew the festival would always be a safe and happy place.
