Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved his cozy sweater. It was warm and soft, and he wore it every day. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, it's time to go outside and play. But it's cold outside, so don't forget to put on your sweater." 
Timmy replied, "Okay, Mommy. I will put on my sweater." He went to his room and found his sweater on the floor. He picked it up and put it on. "I love my sweater," he said. "It's so useful." 
As Timmy was playing outside, he saw his friend Billy. Billy said, "Timmy, why do you always wear that sweater? It's not even that cold outside." 
Timmy said, "I wear my sweater because it keeps me warm and it's my favorite. But now it's time to go inside. Mommy said it's getting close to dinner time." 
Timmy and Billy went inside and had dinner with their families. Timmy's sweater kept him warm and cozy all night long. The end.
