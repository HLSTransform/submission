Once upon a time, there was a little girl named True. She was very tidy and liked to keep her room clean. True had a big toy box where she put all her toys when she was done playing with them.
One sunny day, True decided to wander outside to play. She walked around her yard and saw pretty flowers and colorful butterflies. True felt so happy to be outside in the sunshine.
As True wandered, she found a little lost kitten. The kitten was scared and hungry. True picked up the kitten and took it back to her tidy room. She gave the kitten some food and a warm bed. The kitten was so thankful for True's help. From that day on, True and the kitten became the best of friends.
