Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures with her pencil. One day, she was being clumsy and dropped her pencil on the floor. 
Lily's mom came into the room and saw what happened. She demanded that Lily pick up her pencil and be more careful. Lily felt sad and apologized to her mom. 
After that, Lily was more careful and didn't drop her pencil anymore. She drew lots of beautiful pictures and showed them to her mom. Her mom was very proud of her for being so careful with her pencil. The end.
