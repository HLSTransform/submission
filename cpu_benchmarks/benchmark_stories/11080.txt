One day, a little pig and a little duck were playing in the mud. They liked to splash and roll and make funny noises. They did not see the farmer who was watching them from behind a fence.
The farmer was very hungry and wanted to eat the pig and the duck for his dinner. He thought they were stupid and easy to catch. He had a big net and a sharp knife. He waited for the right moment to sneak up on them.
"Hey, pig, look at me!" the duck said. "I can flap my wings and fly in the air!" The duck jumped and flapped and flew a little bit. The pig clapped his hooves and laughed.
"That's amazing, duck!" the pig said. "You are so clever and brave! I wish I could fly like you!"
The farmer saw his chance. He ran towards the pig and the duck with his net and his knife. He threw the net over the pig and grabbed the duck by the neck. The pig and the duck were scared and screamed.
"Help! Help! The farmer is here! He wants to eat us!" they cried.
But it was too late. The farmer was stronger and faster than them. He put them in a sack and took them to his house. He cooked them in a big pot and ate them for his dinner. He was very happy and full. He did not care that the pig and the duck were his friends. He was a bad and greedy farmer. The end.
