Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They like to imagine they are animals. Lily is a cute bunny and Ben is a big lion. They hop and roar and chase each other.
"Rawr! I'm going to catch you, bunny!" Ben says.
"No, you can't! I'm too fast and smart!" Lily says.
They run to the slide and slide down. They see a sign that says "exit". They don't know what it means.
"What is exit?" Lily asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it's a secret door to another place," Ben says.
They go to the sign and push it. It opens and they see a lot of cars and people.
"Wow! Look at all the colors and noises!" Lily says.
"Let's go and explore!" Ben says.
They hold hands and walk out of the park. They see a lot of things they have never seen before. They are very curious and excited. They forget they are animals and start to talk to the people.
"Hello! We are Lily and Ben. We are playing in the park. What are you doing?" they say.
The people are surprised and amused by the two children. They smile and talk to them. They tell them about the exit and the street and the shops. They also tell them to be careful and not to go too far.
Lily and Ben learn a lot of new words and things. They have a lot of fun. They also miss their mom and dad. They decide to go back to the park and find them.
They say goodbye to the people and thank them. They go back to the exit and push it. It opens and they see the park again.
They run to the slide and slide down. They see their mom and dad waiting for them. They hug them and tell them about their adventure.
"We imagined we were animals and we found an exit and we saw a lot of cars and people and shops and we learned a lot of new words and things!" they say.
Mom and dad are happy and proud of them. They also tell them to be careful and not to go out of the park without them.
They all go home and have a nice dinner. Lily and Ben tell their mom and dad more stories about their imagination. They are very happy. They love to imagine.
