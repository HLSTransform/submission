One day, a small boy wanted to go on an adventure. So he took his mule and headed off down the long road. As he walked, he got tired, so he decided to climb up his mule. He rode along, feeling like the king of the world!
He saw a tall tree that had lots of leaves and branches. The boy decided he would climb up the tree, to have even more fun! He scrambled up easily and looked around from the top. He could see for miles and miles.
At the very top, he saw a big bird. The bird said hello to the boy and asked him to come for a ride. The boy was so excited, he gladly hopped onto the bird's back and away they flew.
The bird took them to the highest mountain, and the boy was so glad to see it. The bird taught him how to climb the mountain, so the boy happily started climbing the long road to the top.
After a long climb, the boy finally reached the top. From there, he could see the whole world! He waved at the bird and thanked him for the incredible adventure. Then he hopped back onto his mule and made his way home.
