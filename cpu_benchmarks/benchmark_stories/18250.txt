Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mommy gave her a quiz to see if she knew her numbers. Lily counted all the way up to ten and her mommy was very proud of her.
Later that day, Lily went to play with her friends. They found some toys and started playing with them. Lily's friend, Tommy, started to take some toys and put them in his pocket. Lily saw this and told him that it wasn't nice to take things that weren't his. Tommy felt guilty and gave the toys back.
Lily's mommy was very happy when she heard about what happened. She told Lily that it's always important to do the right thing, even if it's hard. Lily smiled and knew that counting and being honest were very important things to do.
