Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her long hair and didn't want to get a haircut. One day, her mom said, "Lily, it's time for your haircut." But Lily said, "No, I don't want to!" She was very enthusiastic about keeping her long hair.
Lily's mom tried to convince her, but Lily didn't want to listen. So, she decided to escape from the house and run away. She went to the park and played on the swings. But soon, she realized that she was hungry and cold. She missed her mom and dad.
She went back home and saw her mom waiting for her. "Lily, where were you?" her mom asked. "I'm sorry, Mom. I just didn't want to get a haircut," Lily said. "I understand, but we need to take care of your hair. Let's go get your haircut together," her mom said. Lily felt better and went to get her haircut with her mom.
