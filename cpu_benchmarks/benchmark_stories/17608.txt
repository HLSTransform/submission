Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun and look at the pretty rainbow in the sky. One day, it started to rain and the rainbow disappeared. Lily was sad because she wanted to see it again.
Suddenly, she heard her mom call her inside. She ran as fast as she could and accidentally broke her favorite toy. She was very sad again. But her mom gave her a big hug and told her it was okay, they could fix it together.
After they fixed the toy, the rain stopped and the sun came out. Lily looked outside and saw the most beautiful rainbow she had ever seen. She was so happy and ran outside to show her mom. They both smiled and enjoyed the rainbow together. The end.
