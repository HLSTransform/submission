One day, a yellow bird left its nest. It flew away, chirping and flapping. The bird flew over the town, and soon it found a big puddle. The puddle was sparkling in the sun. 
The bird flew down and hovered over the puddle. It saw its reflection in the water, and it jumped in. The bird splashed around and had so much fun. It sang and jumped, and made a big splash. 
When the bird got tired, it left the puddle. It flew up high into the sky, and went home to its nest. 
The bird was tired and happy. It had a fun time in the yellow puddle.
