One morning, a young rabbit hopped outside. The sunshine was shining and it was a beautiful day. The young rabbit wanted to have fun, so it started to zoom around. It hopped around, feeling so shiny and full of energy.
The rabbit came across another young animal - a young fox. The fox asked what the rabbit was doing. The rabbit said it was zooming around, and that it was so fun! 
The fox wanted to zoom too, so the two young animals raced around together. They zig-zagged and zipped all around, enjoying the sunshine and feeling so full of energy. The fox and the rabbit ran and ran and ran, until they were out of breath.
The two young animals felt so happy and tired from all the zooming around. They smiled and said goodbye, and the rabbit hopped away in the sunshine, ready for the next adventure.
