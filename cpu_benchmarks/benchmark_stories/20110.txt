Ben and Sam were brothers who liked to play outside. They had a toy camera that could record what they saw. They wanted to make a movie of the animals in the woods.
They walked into the woods with their camera and looked for animals. They saw a bird on a twig and recorded it. They saw a rabbit in the grass and recorded it. They saw a deer in the trees and recorded it. They were happy and excited.
But then they heard a loud roar. It was a bear! The bear saw them and ran towards them. Ben and Sam were scared and ran away. They dropped their camera and left it behind.
They ran back to their house and told their mom what happened. Their mom was glad they were safe, but sad they lost their camera. She said the camera was not reliable, because it did not protect them from the bear. She said they should not go into the woods alone, because it was dangerous.
Ben and Sam were sorry they lost their camera and their movie. They learned a lesson. They decided to play in the yard instead, where it was safe. They hoped the bear did not eat their camera. They hoped the animals were okay. They hoped they could get a new camera someday.
