Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went on an adventure in the forest. He walked and walked until he found a big chest. "What's inside?" he asked himself. He tried to open it, but it was locked. Suddenly, a man appeared and said, "That chest is mine. It's very distant from your home. You shouldn't be here." 
Timmy was scared, but he wanted to see what was inside the chest. "Please let me open it," he begged. The man said no and walked away. Timmy waited until the man was gone, then he opened the chest. 
Inside, he found a treasure! But as he reached for it, a trap door opened and he fell into a dark hole. He was stuck and couldn't get out. Timmy realized he shouldn't have opened the chest. He cried and cried until someone found him. The end.
