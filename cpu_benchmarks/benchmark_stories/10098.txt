Lily and Ben were playing in their room. They had many toys, but they wanted to do something new. They saw a lamp on the table. The lamp was big and shiny. It had a switch and a cord.
"Let's play with the lamp!" Lily said. "We can make shadows on the wall."
"OK!" Ben said. "But we have to be careful. The lamp is hot and bright. And we can't pull the cord."
They took the lamp and put it on the floor. They turned off the light and turned on the lamp. They made funny shapes with their hands in front of the lamp. They saw the shadows on the wall. They laughed and had fun.
"Look, I'm a bunny!" Lily said, making ears with her fingers.
"And I'm a bird!" Ben said, flapping his arms.
They played with the lamp for a long time. Then they heard their mom calling them.
"Kids, it's time for dinner!" Mom said. "Come to the kitchen. I made something delicious for you."
Lily and Ben ran to the kitchen. They smelled something yummy. They saw a big pot on the stove.
"What is it, Mom?" Lily asked.
"It's soup!" Mom said. "It has carrots and potatoes and chicken. Do you want some?"
"Yes, please!" Lily and Ben said.
Mom gave them each a bowl of soup and a spoon. They blew on the soup to cool it down. Then they tasted it. It was warm and tasty.
"Mmm, this is delicious!" Lily said.
"I agree!" Ben said.
They ate their soup and thanked their mom. They were happy and full.
"Can we play with the lamp again after dinner?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but only for a little while," Mom said. "Then you have to brush your teeth and go to bed."
"OK, Mom," Lily and Ben said.
They finished their dinner and ran back to their room. They played with the lamp some more. They had to choose which shapes to make. They had a good day.
