Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to eat. One day, Spot wanted to make a sausage. He thought it would be a fun thing to do.
Spot went to the kitchen and found a sausage. He tried to make it, but he made a big mess. He was very ashamed. Spot's mom came in and saw the mess. She was not happy.
Spot's mom said, "You can't make a sausage, Spot. You are too little." Spot was very sad. He went to his room and cried. He never tried to make a sausage again.
