One day, Little Jack was playing in his backyard with his friends. Suddenly, he saw an unfamiliar red vegetable that had arrived in the garden. He ran to his mom and asked her what it was, "Mom! What is this?" he asked excitedly. Mom smiled and replied,"It's a radish, Jack. It's harmless and it's a yummy vegetable. Let's go pick it and put it in the salad!"
Little Jack was excited to try the new vegetable. He was so happy that something new had arrived in his garden. He and his mom harvested the radish, and when they served supper, it tasted delicious.
Jack learned from this experience that if you try new things, you may find something delightful. Radishes are harmless and they can bring joy and a wonderful taste to your meal.
