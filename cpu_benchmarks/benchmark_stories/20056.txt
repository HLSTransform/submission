Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to a restaurant with her mommy and daddy. They ordered yummy food like pizza and spaghetti. Suddenly, Lily spilled her drink all over the table. 
"Oh no!" Lily said. "My drink spilled. Can we repair it?"
Her mommy and daddy smiled and gave her a napkin to clean it up. After they finished eating, they left the restaurant and walked outside. They saw an unknown animal walking by.
"Look, mommy and daddy!" Lily shouted. "What is that unknown animal?"
"It's a raccoon," her daddy replied.
Lily learned something new that day and was happy she got to eat yummy food and see an unknown animal.
