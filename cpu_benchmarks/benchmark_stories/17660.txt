Once, there was a family of three. Mom, Dad, and Jack. They all loved each other very much. 
In winter, Jack often got cold and lonely. One day he asked his mom and dad if they could find someone to help him have fun. 
Mom and Dad thought and thought and they found a surprise! They found a helpful friend to separate Jack from the cold.
It was a warm little puppy! They named him Ralph.
Ralph was so helpful in winter. Jack and Ralph played together every day. They ran in the snow, jumped in the leaves, and chased the birds. Jack was never lonely or cold again. 
Mom and Dad were so happy that Ralph was helping Jack. They all lived happily ever after!
