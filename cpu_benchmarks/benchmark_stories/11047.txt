Tom and Sue are brother and sister. They like to play with their toys in the living room. But they do not like to share. Sometimes they quarrel over who gets to play with what.
One day, they both want to play with the radio. The radio can make music and sounds. Tom grabs the radio and turns it on. He likes to hear the fast songs. He dances and jumps around.
Sue does not like the fast songs. She likes to hear the slow songs. She tries to take the radio from Tom. She says, "Give me the radio! I want to hear the slow songs!"
Tom says, "No! It is my turn! I want to hear the fast songs!"
They pull and tug on the radio. They yell and cry. They do not listen to each other.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the living room. She sees Tom and Sue quarreling over the radio. She is not happy. She says, "Stop it! You are making too much noise! You need to share the radio and take turns. Or I will take it away."
Tom and Sue stop quarreling. They do not want to lose the radio. They say, "Sorry, Mom. We will share and take turns."
Mom smiles. She says, "That is good. Now, you can enjoy the music and play nicely."
Tom and Sue hug Mom. They hug each other. They agree to play with the radio together. They listen to the fast songs and the slow songs. They dance and sing along. They have fun.
