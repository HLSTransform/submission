Once upon a time, there was a blue bird who lived in a tree. One day, the bird saw a nut on the ground and wanted to eat it. But the nut was too big to fit in the bird's beak. The bird tried to break the nut with its beak, but it didn't work.
Then, the bird saw a knob on the tree and thought it could use it to break the nut. The bird flew to the knob and tried to split the nut with it. After a few tries, the nut split into two pieces! The bird was so happy and ate the nut.
From that day on, the bird always looked for knobs to help it split nuts. And every time it split a nut, it felt proud of itself. The end.
