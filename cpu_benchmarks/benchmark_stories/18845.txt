Lily and Max are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big jar of sugar on a bench. They are very happy.
"Look, Max, sugar! We can eat it and be sweet!" Lily says.
"Yes, Lily, sugar! Let's open it and have some!" Max says.
They open the jar and take some sugar with their fingers. They put it in their mouths and smile. It is very yummy.
But then, a big dog comes. It sees the jar of sugar and wants it too. It barks and runs to the bench. It knocks over the jar and spills the sugar on the ground.
"Hey, dog, stop! That is our sugar!" Lily shouts.
"Go away, dog, you are bad!" Max shouts.
The dog does not listen. It licks the sugar on the ground and growls at Lily and Max. They are scared and sad. They have no more sugar.
Then, a lady comes. She sees the dog and the jar and the sugar. She is angry.
"Bad dog, bad dog! What have you done? That is my sugar! I left it here for a minute!" she says.
She grabs the dog by the collar and pulls it away. She looks at Lily and Max and sees their faces.
"I'm sorry, kids, I didn't know you were here. Did the dog hurt you?" she asks.
"No, lady, we are okay. But the dog ate our sugar. We found it on the bench and we wanted to eat it. It was very yummy," Lily says.
The lady smiles and says, "Oh, I see. Well, that was very naughty of the dog. And of you, too. You shouldn't eat sugar from a jar you don't know. It could be bad for you. Sugar is not good for your teeth or your tummy."
Lily and Max feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, lady. We didn't know. We just wanted to be sweet."
The lady says, "It's okay, kids. I forgive you. But you don't need sugar to be sweet. You are sweet enough already. You know what is sweeter than sugar?"
Lily and Max shake their heads. They don't know.
The lady says, "A kiss. A kiss is sweeter than sugar. And it makes you happy and lucky. Do you want a kiss?"
Lily and Max nod. They do want a kiss.
The lady bends down and gives them each a kiss on the cheek. They feel warm and happy. They smile and say, "Thank you, lady. You are very nice."
The lady says, "You're welcome, kids. You are very nice, too. Now, go and play. And remember, no more sugar from strangers. Only kisses from friends."
Lily and Max say, "Okay, lady. We will remember. Bye, bye."
They wave to the lady and the dog. They hold hands and run to the swings. They are sweet and happy and lucky. They kiss each other on the cheek and laugh. They are friends.
