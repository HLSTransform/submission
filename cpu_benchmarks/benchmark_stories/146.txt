Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside in the park. One day, Timmy's mom told him they were going on a camping trip. Timmy was very excited! 
As they were packing, Timmy's mom reminded him to bring his flashlight. Timmy grabbed his flashlight and put it in his backpack. 
When they arrived at the campsite, Timmy wanted to explore right away. He saw a beautiful lake and wanted to go swimming. But his mom told him they needed to set up the tent first. Timmy was impatient and wanted to hurry up, but he knew he had to help his mom. 
That night, when it got dark, Timmy was glad he brought his flashlight. They used it to find their way back to the tent. Timmy realized that it was important to be patient and listen to his mom's advice. He learned that sometimes it's bitter to wait, but it's worth it in the end.
