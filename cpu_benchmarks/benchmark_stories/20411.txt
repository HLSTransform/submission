Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a bedroom with a big bed where she slept every night. One day, Lily woke up feeling grumpy because she didn't want to go to school. She didn't want to get out of bed and go to class. 
But her mom told her that she had to go to school because it was important to learn new things. Lily didn't listen and stayed in her bedroom all day. She didn't do her homework or play with her toys. 
At the end of the day, Lily's teacher called her mom and told her that Lily missed an important test. Her mom was very disappointed and Lily felt sad. She realized that staying in her bedroom all day was not a good idea. She learned that it's important to listen to her mom and go to school. The end.
