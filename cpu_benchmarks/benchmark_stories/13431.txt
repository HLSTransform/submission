Once upon a time, there was a happy bunny named Bubbles. Bubbles loved to jump and play in the green grass. One day, Bubbles saw a big tree with a lot of leaves. Bubbles wanted to see the leaves up close, so he decided to jump as high as he could.
As Bubbles jumped, he saw a little girl named Lily. Lily had a big smile on her face and was rubbing her eyes. Bubbles went over to Lily and asked her why she was rubbing her eyes. Lily said she had a boo-boo and it hurt. Bubbles had an idea! He was feeling creative, so he hopped over to a nearby flower and picked it. He gave the flower to Lily and it made her feel better.
From that day on, Bubbles and Lily became the best of friends. They would jump and play together every day. Whenever Lily had a boo-boo, Bubbles would bring her a flower to rub on it. They had so much fun together, and Bubbles was happy to have a new friend. The end.
