Once there was a girl who had an ugly face. Every day she was sad and she used to cry. She felt embarrassed and ashamed of her face and never left her house.
One day, she saw a rainbow in the sky and it made her smile. She climbed up to the roof to get a better look and it made her feel special. She realised that no matter what, she was still beautiful in the eyes of the world.
She stopped crying and her face was filled with light and happiness. She decided to go outside and the world around her seemed magical. Everyone she met smiled and greeted her and it made her feel so loved.
The girl soon forgot what it felt like to cry and she started living life to the fullest. From then on, she always looked on the bright side and found happiness every day.
