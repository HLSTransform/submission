Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow, but she didn't like to wear her warm coat. Her mommy always told her that she would catch a cold if she didn't wear it, but Lily didn't listen.
One day, Lily went outside to play without her coat again. She was having so much fun building a snowman that she didn't hear her mommy calling her. When she finally went back inside, she felt very cold and her nose was running. She had caught a cold, just like her mommy had warned her.
Lily learned her lesson and promised to always wear her coat when she went outside in the cold. She also realized that not listening to her mommy had made things very messy and difficult for her. From then on, she made sure to always listen to her mommy's advice. The end.
