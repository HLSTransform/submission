Once upon a time, there was a young pup named Bear. He was a happy pup and he liked to explore. One day, he went for a walk and saw a beautiful cat. He wanted to say hello, but he was too shy.
He looked up at the cat and said, "Hi, my name is Bear." The cat smiled and said, "Hello, Bear. I'm Kitty." 
Kitty asked Bear what he was planning to do for the day, and Bear told her that he wanted to go chasing after the birds in the park. Kitty said, "That sounds like loads of fun! However, you should be careful. You could lose your collar!" 
Bear was wearing a dull, old collar. He didn't want to lose it, so he decided to make a plan to keep it safe. He put his collar in his pocket, and suddenly came up with a brilliant plan! He decided to tie a string to the collar, and tie the other end of the string to his foot. That way, he would never lose it.
The two friends said goodbye and went their separate ways. Bear ran off to the park, ready to chase some birds with the comfort of knowing he wouldn't lose his collar. 
The end.
