Sara did not like broccoli. She thought it was green and yucky. She did not want to eat it for dinner. She pushed it away with her fork.
"Please, Sara, try some broccoli. It is good for you," her mom said. She urged Sara to eat some. She put a small piece on her plate.
Sara shook her head. She made a face. She said, "No, thank you. I want pasta."
Her mom sighed. She said, "You can have pasta after you eat some broccoli. Just one bite, okay?"
Sara looked at the broccoli. She did not want to make her mom sad. She was a good girl. She picked up the piece with her fingers. She was careful not to drop it. She put it in her mouth. She chewed it slowly.
She was surprised. It was not so bad. It was a little crunchy and a little sweet. She swallowed it. She smiled at her mom.
"See, it is not yucky. Do you want some more?" her mom asked.
Sara nodded. She said, "Yes, please. I like broccoli."
Her mom was happy. She gave her some more broccoli and some pasta. She said, "I am proud of you, Sara. You are a brave girl."
Sara felt good. She ate her dinner. She liked broccoli. She was glad she tried it.
