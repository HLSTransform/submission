Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had a big book called a dictionary. Tim loved to look at the pictures in the dictionary. He liked to learn new words.
One day, Tim was very hungry. He wanted to eat a cookie. But his mom said, "No, Tim, you cannot eat a cookie now. It is almost time for dinner." Tim was sad. He did not want to wait for dinner.
Tim had an idea. He went to his dictionary and found a picture of a cookie. He thought that if he put the picture in front of his face, it would prevent him from being hungry. So, he tried it. But it didn't work. Tim was still hungry. He knew he had to wait for dinner. And when dinner came, it was delicious. Tim was happy, and he learned that sometimes, it is good to wait.
