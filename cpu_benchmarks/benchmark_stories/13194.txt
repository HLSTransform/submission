Once upon a time, there were two friends named Rick and Kate. Rick loved playing games and always wanted to win. Every day, he would try to come up with new ways to challenge Kate.
One day, Rick found a special game. It was a modern game and it had lots of ice. Rick and Kate decided to play it together.
They had to use the ice to build structures and then the structures had to be the tallest. The tallest structure would win the game.
Rick and Kate worked together and created the tallest structure ever! Everyone was impressed by their work and Rick was very proud to win the game.
Kate was happy too, even though she didnâ€™t win. She was proud of how well they worked together as friends. From then on, Rick and Kate always wanted to play together and have fun.
