Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They like to slide and swing and run. They see a big dog with a red collar. The dog is barking and wagging its tail.
"Can we pet the dog?" Lily asks Ben.
"I don't know. Maybe we should ask the owner first," Ben says.
They look around, but they do not see anyone with the dog. The dog comes closer and sniffs them. It seems friendly.
"Hello, doggy. What is your name?" Lily says. She reaches out her hand to touch the dog.
The dog does not answer. It growls and shows its teeth. It bites Lily's hand hard. Lily screams and cries. Ben is scared and runs away.
A man comes running from the other side of the park. He is the owner of the dog. He sees Lily bleeding and the dog barking.
"Bad dog! Bad dog! Let go of the girl!" he shouts. He pulls the dog away from Lily.
He says he is sorry and he did not know the dog would do that. He says he will take Lily to the doctor and pay for her hurt. He says he will keep the dog on a leash from now on.
But Lily does not hear him. She is too hurt and sad. She does not want to pet any dog ever again. She wishes she had not tried to touch the dog. She wishes Ben had stayed with her. She wishes the dog had answered her.
