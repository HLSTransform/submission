Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the park. One day, she brought a bag of colorful candy with her. She wanted to scatter the candy on the ground and see how far it would go. 
Lilyâ€™s mom told her to be careful and not to make a mess. She asked Lily to measure out how much candy she was going to scatter. Lily counted out ten pieces of candy and put the rest away. 
Lily took a deep breath and threw the candy in the air. It went everywhere! Some landed on the grass, some on the slide, and some on the bench. Lily was so happy with the perfect scattering of candy. She picked up the pieces and shared them with her friends. They all had a sweet time playing together.
