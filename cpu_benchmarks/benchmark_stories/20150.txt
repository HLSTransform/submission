Sara and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to pick strawberries from the plants and eat them. They were sweet and juicy.
One day, they saw a big red strawberry that was bigger than their hands. They both wanted it and ran to get it. They pulled and pulled, but the strawberry did not come off. They started to argue and shout.
"Let go, it's mine!" Sara said.
"No, it's mine!" Ben said.
They did not see the bee that was flying near the strawberry. The bee was angry and stung them both on their noses. They let go of the strawberry and cried. Their noses hurt and felt spicy.
They ran to their moms and showed them their noses. Their moms put some ice and cream on them and hugged them. They told them to say sorry to each other and share the strawberry.
Sara and Ben felt bad and went back to the garden. They saw the strawberry still on the plant. They said sorry and hugged each other. They decided to unite and work together to pick the strawberry. They used a knife and cut it in half. They each took a piece and ate it. It was the best strawberry they ever had.
They learned that it is better to unite and share than to fight and sting. They smiled and played in the garden again.
