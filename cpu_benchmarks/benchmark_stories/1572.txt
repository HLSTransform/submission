Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved Christmas because she got to see Santa and his reindeer. One day, Lily went outside to play in the snow. It was very wet and she got all wet too. 
As she was playing, she saw a reindeer stuck in the snow. "Oh no!" she said. "Reindeer, are you okay?" The reindeer tried to get up but it was too slippery. 
Lily ran inside to get her dad. "Dad, come quick! There's a reindeer outside and it's stuck in the snow!" Her dad came outside and saw the reindeer. "We have to help it," he said. They tried to push the reindeer out but it was too heavy. 
Just then, Santa came flying by in his sleigh. "Ho ho ho! What seems to be the problem?" he asked. Lily told him about the reindeer and Santa said he would help. He landed his sleigh and with his magic, he lifted the reindeer out of the snow. "Thank you, Santa!" Lily said. Santa smiled and said, "Merry Christmas!"
