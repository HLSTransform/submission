One day, Momma and the three year old went for a walk in the park. They saw a tall tree blowing in the breeze and the three year old said "I want to spray it!" So Momma got a can of water and let the three year old spray the tree. It felt cool and refreshing.
The three year old kept spraying until the can was empty. Then they felt a sudden heat on their faces and realised the sun was coming out. To make the most of the warmth, they sat on a bench to enjoy the sun.
The three year old started to feel sleepy, so Momma got a blanket and wrapped them up in it. They stayed in the park until they felt sleepy and then they slowly walked home.
