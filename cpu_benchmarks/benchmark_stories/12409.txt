Once upon a time, there was a wealthy family. The family was very happy and they planned to get a new crib for their baby.
Mommy, Daddy, and the big brother went to the store. They looked at lots of different cribs. Finally, they decided on the perfect one with yellow and blue bars.
When they got home, Daddy got to work. He put the crib together and it looked just like the one that they had chosen.
The baby was so excited when she saw her new crib. She couldn't wait to sleep in it! She was a very happy baby.
The wealthy family was so pleased with their new purchase. Everyone had a big smile on their face. 
The end.
