Once upon a time, there was a cabin in the woods. Inside the cabin, there was a little girl. Every night, the girl would whisper to herself. One clear night, she heard a voice whisper back. She was so scared that she crept out of the cabin and ran away.
The next night, the girl came back to the cabin. She was still scared, but she was brave. She leaned close to the cabin and softly whispered, "Is anyone there?"
This time, she heard the voice answer. It said, "Yes, I am here". The voice was so gentle that the girl felt a little bit safer.
The girl and the voice talked every night. The voice told the girl stories and said kind words. It always made her feel happy.
Then one day, the voice said, "Time for me to go". The girl was sad that the voice had to go, but she said goodbye. She knew she'd never forget the voice that had whispered to her in the clear night.
