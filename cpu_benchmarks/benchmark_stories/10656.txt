One day, a girl wanted to borrow a crack. She was only three years old, but she thought it was a good idea. All her friends had them, and it seemed like it would be fun. 
She went to her mom and dad and asked if she could take it. They said no, it was too weird.
The girl was sad. She really wanted the crack. She thought of a solution. She asked her mom and dad if she could borrow it from her grandma. 
Her parents were surprised. They were happy the girl was being so creative. They agreed she could borrow the crack from grandma.
The girl was so excited! She hugged her mom and dad and promised to take good care of the crack. Then she ran off to go find grandma and ask to borrow the crack.
