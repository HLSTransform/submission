Once upon a time, there was a grumpy bear. He was so grumpy, he never smiled. He didn't like to celebrate or have fun at all.
One day, the bear decided to go for a walk. He followed a trail through the woods. As he walked, he noticed some things moving in the trees.
He stopped and looked up. Suddenly, there were colorful birds singing and dancing around him. It was so beautiful, it made the bear smile. 
The birds were celebrating! They were celebrating how wonderful life is, and the bear knew he wanted to join in. He followed the trail, celebrating and singing with the birds.
The grumpy bear was now happy and smiling. He celebrated the beauty of nature, and enjoyed the rest of his trail with the happy birds.
