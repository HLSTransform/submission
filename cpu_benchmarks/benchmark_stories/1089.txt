Once upon a time, there were two best friends, Tom and Tim. Tom wanted to invite Tim to a meeting, but Tom's mom said no. She didn't permit the boys to go to the meeting. Tim was very sad. 
He got an idea. He asked his mom if he could go to the meeting, but this time with Tom's mom too. His mom thought it was a great idea and she agreed. 
Tom and Tim were so excited to go to the meeting. But when they arrived, it was terrible! The meeting was so boring that they couldn't even stay. They decided to leave and play together outside instead. They had so much fun playing in the sunshine and the fresh air. 
Tom and Tim were very happy that they didn't have to stay at the terrible meeting!
