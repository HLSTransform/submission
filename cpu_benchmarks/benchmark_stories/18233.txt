Once upon a time, there was a new pool in the park. The sun would shine on it every day. It was so pretty. All the kids liked to play in the pool. They would splash and laugh.
One day, a big dog came to the park. The dog liked the pool too. But the dog was not nice. It would jump in the pool and scare the kids. The kids were sad. They did not want to play in the pool with the big dog.
A little girl had an idea. She went to the store and got a big ball. She took the ball to the park. She threw the ball far away. The big dog saw the ball and ran after it. The dog liked the ball more than the pool. Now the kids could play in the pool again. They were happy and the sun kept shining on their new pool.
