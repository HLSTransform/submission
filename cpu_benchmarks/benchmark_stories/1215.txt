Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved watching movies with her family. One day, she went to the movie theater with her mom and dad. They watched a funny movie about a cat and a mouse.
After the movie, they went to get some ice cream. Lily wanted to hold the ice cream by herself, but she was nervous that she might drop it. Her dad said, "Don't worry, Lily. You can do it!" But as she was holding the ice cream, it slipped from her hand and fell on the ground. Lily was sad and thought she had broken the ice cream.
Her mom said, "It's okay, Lily. We can buy another one. But remember, things can break, but it's important to not be nervous and try again." Lily learned that it's okay to make mistakes and that she can always try again.
