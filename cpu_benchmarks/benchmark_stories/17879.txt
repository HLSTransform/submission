Once upon a time, there was a tire. It was hidden in the park. Every day, it waited there, but no one ever found it.
One day, a little girl came to the park. She was very small and she liked to play. She saw the hidden tire. She wanted to play with it so she ran over to it.
The little girl was so happy. She showed it to her mommy. Then, she and mommy went to a pond. The girl put the tire in the water and it started to splash!
Fishes and frogs swam away and the girl laughed and smiled. The tire splashed and splashed and the little girl was having so much fun.
When the sun went down, the little girl and her mommy had to go home. The little girl said goodbye to the tire, but she knew she'd be back soon.
