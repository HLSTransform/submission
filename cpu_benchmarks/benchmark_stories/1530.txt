Once there was a little bird that lived in the woods. Everyday in the spring, the bird would flutter and play in the woods. One day when the bird was playing, something disturbed it. It was a dull sound. The bird looked around but could not find what was causing the noise. All around her, the birds sang and the flowers bloomed, but the dull sound kept going and going. Suddenly, a big, scary creature appeared! It was a bear. The poor bird was so frightened! But she quickly flew away and the bear roared before going back to his cave. From that day on, the little bird was extra careful in the spring, to make sure she was never disturbed again.
