Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a very pretty dress that she loved to wear. One day, she saw her friend Sarah wearing an even prettier dress. Lily felt envious of Sarah's dress and wanted one just like it.
Lily went to her mom and said, "Mommy, I want a pretty dress like Sarah's." Her mom said, "Let's go to the store and find one for you." At the store, they found a beautiful dress that Lily loved. Her mom said, "Let's buy it and take it home."
When they got home, Lily wanted to try on her new dress. But she accidentally cut a small hole in it while taking off the tag. She felt very sad and scared that her mom would be mad. But her mom said, "Don't worry, it's just a small threat. We can fix it and your dress will be good as new." Lily was relieved and happy that her mom wasn't mad at her.
