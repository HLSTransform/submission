Once upon a time, there was a mighty lion. He was very brave and mighty but he was very thirsty. He wanted a drink.
The lion ventured out into a nearby lawn and put his sharp eyes to use to look for something to drink. Suddenly, he saw a small puddle. He got excited and walked up to it. The lion took a sip and found it was yummy. He was very, very happy!
He finished drinking all the water and was ready to leave, when he heard a voice. It said, "Why are you drinking all the water in the lawn?" It was a small frog.
The lion smiled and said, "I'm thirsty and I wanted something to drink." The frog smiled too and said, "Well, I can help you with that. There is a big river not too far away and the water there is even better than the water here.
The lion thanked the frog for his kindness and set off to find the river. When he finally arrived, he found the water was so cool and so tasty, he wanted to drink more. He thanked the frog for helping him find such a mighty river. 
The lion was happy and content and never wanted for a drink again.
