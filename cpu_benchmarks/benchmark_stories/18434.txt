Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved Christmas and all the cute animals that came with it. One day, Lily's friend came over to play with her. Her friend had a toy reindeer that was so adorable! Lily loved it so much that she asked her friend if she could lend it to her for a little while. Her friend said yes and Lily was so happy! She played with the adorable reindeer all day long. When it was time for her friend to go home, Lily gave the reindeer back and said thank you for lending it to her. Lily went to bed that night dreaming about all the fun she had with the adorable reindeer.
