Lily and Tom were hungry. They wanted to eat hot dogs. They asked their dad if he could use the grill and make some for them.
"Sure, kids. Let me get the grill ready. You can help me by getting the buns and the ketchup from the kitchen," dad said.
Lily and Tom ran to the kitchen and found the buns and the ketchup. They brought them to the backyard, where dad was lighting the grill. They saw some smoke and smelled something good.
"Dad, can we watch you grill the hot dogs?" Lily asked.
"Of course, but be careful. The grill is very hot. Stay back and don't touch it," dad warned.
Lily and Tom nodded and watched dad put the hot dogs on the grill. They heard them sizzle and pop. They saw them turn brown and juicy.
"Dad, are they ready yet?" Tom asked.
"Almost, buddy. Just a few more minutes. You two are lucky. We have enough hot dogs for everyone, and some extra for later," dad said.
Lily and Tom smiled. They loved hot dogs. They waited patiently until dad took them off the grill and put them in the buns. They added some ketchup and took a big bite.
"Mmm, these are delicious, dad. Thank you for using the grill and making them for us," Lily said.
"You're welcome, sweetie. I'm glad you like them. You're very good helpers," dad said.
Lily and Tom hugged dad and thanked him again. They ate their hot dogs and felt happy. They thought dad was the best grill master ever.
