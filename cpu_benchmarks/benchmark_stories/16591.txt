Anna and Ben were friends. They liked to play together. One day, they went to the park with their moms. There, they saw a big castle. It was a palace for a king and a queen.
Anna and Ben wanted to see the palace. They asked their moms if they could go. Their moms said yes, but they had to stay close. Anna and Ben nodded. They were very excited.
They ran to the palace. It was very fast. They saw many things. They saw big doors, tall windows, shiny floors, and pretty paintings. They saw a garden with flowers and a fountain. They saw a throne with a crown and a scepter. They saw a ballroom with a chandelier and a piano.
Anna and Ben had fun. They pretended to be a princess and a prince. They danced in the ballroom. They played with the crown and the scepter. They smelled the flowers and splashed in the fountain. They laughed and smiled.
Their moms watched them. They were happy. They took pictures of them. They said it was time to go. Anna and Ben said goodbye to the palace. They thanked their moms. They hugged each other. They said they had a great day. They were still excited.
