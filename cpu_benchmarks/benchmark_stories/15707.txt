Charlie was excited! He was going to the park to have a picnic with his family. On the way, he started to see a lot of funny cartoon characters. They were so brightly colored, Charlie had never seen any like them before. He wanted to take a look, so he stepped closer. Suddenly, a big gray mouse stepped out from behind a bush! Charlie was confused.
The mouse waved his paws and said, "Hi there. I'm looking for my friends. They love cartoons just like you."
Charlie smiled and replied, "I saw a lot of cartoons when I was walking here. Do you think they could be around here?
The mouse nodded and said, "That would make sense. Let's look together!"
So Charlie and the mouse started to search the park. Everywhere they looked, there were funny cartoon characters! Charlie was so excited, he forgot to be confused. He and the mouse were having a lot of fun on their search.
Eventually, the mouse found his friends and waved goodbye to Charlie. Charlie wasn't sad though. He'd had a great time with the mouse and the cartoons! He was so happy, he skipped the rest of the way to the park.
