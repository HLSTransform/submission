Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved her bed. She slept in it every night and it was her favorite place to be. One day, she noticed that the bed was getting old and creaky. She asked her mommy if they could replace it with a new one.
Mommy agreed and they went to the store to look for a new bed. They found one that was big and comfortable. Lily was very happy and couldn't wait to sleep in it. The old bed was harmless, but the new one was even better.
Now, Lily sleeps in her new bed every night and she loves it even more than her old one. She's happy that they replaced it and now she sleeps soundly every night. The end.
