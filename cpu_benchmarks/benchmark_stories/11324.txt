Once upon a time there was a little boy named John. He was only three years old and loved adventure. One day he was exploring in the woods near his home when he stumbled upon a strange looking tree. John knelt down and started to examine the tree carefully. He saw something shiny and reached out to touch it. It was a knife! He picked it up and started to feel excited about his discovery.
John heard footsteps nearby and jumped to his feet. He saw his mother walking towards him with a worried look on her face.
"John, what are you doing? You shouldn't be out here in the woods alone," said his mother.
John held out the knife towards his mom and said, "Look Mommy, I found a knife!"
His mother looked at the knife and shook her head in disapproval. 
"No, John. That's very dangerous. You should put it down and come with me," she said.
John frowned and put the knife down. He wanted to keep it and thought his mom was being mean. He kicked the ground and said, "But why?"
His mother kneeled down and said, "I love you, John. I support you, but sometimes I have to make sure you are safe. This knife is too sharp and would be dangerous for a small child like you."
John nodded his head as his mother took his hand. Together they walked back home
