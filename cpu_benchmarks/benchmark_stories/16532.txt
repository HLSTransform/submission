Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a fancy dress that she loved to wear. One day, she went to the park and accidentally fell down. She hurt her knee and started to cry. 
Her mom came to comfort her and gave her a big hug. She also gave her a copper coin to make her feel better. Lily felt happy again and showed her mom the fancy dress she was wearing. 
From that day on, Lily always wore her fancy dress to the park. She remembered the copper coin her mom gave her and kept it in her pocket. Whenever she felt sad, she would touch the copper coin and remember her mom's comforting hug.
