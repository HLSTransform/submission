Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and cars. They have a task to do. They have to clean up their toys before lunch.
Anna wants to play with the red car. Ben wants to play with the red car too. They both reach for the car.
"Mine!" Anna says.
"No, mine!" Ben says.
They pull the car from each other. The car breaks. They both cry.
Mom comes and sees the broken car. She is sad.
"Anna, Ben, what happened?" Mom asks.
"We both wanted the red car. We did not yield. We broke the car." Anna says.
"I'm sorry, Mom. We were not kind. We did not share." Ben says.
Mom hugs them.
"It's okay, Anna, Ben. I'm glad you are sorry. You can fix the car together. Then you can finish your task and clean up your toys. Then we can have lunch." Mom says.
Anna and Ben nod. They say sorry to each other. They fix the car. They share the car. They clean up their toys. They are happy. They have lunch with Mom. They are kind friends.
