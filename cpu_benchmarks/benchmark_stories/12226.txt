Once upon a time there was a girl called Sarah. She wanted to go for an adventure, so she asked her mom if she could ride a mule. Her mom said no, Sarah was too young, so she wasn't allowed. 
But Sarah didn't give up easily. She asked her mom again and again. Finally, her mom said yes. She allowed Sarah to go for her adventure on the mule.
Sarah was so excited, she ran outside and jumped on the mule's back. It was a sweet mule, because it didn't want to leave Sarah behind. Together they went on an adventure around the woods. 
Hours passed and Sarah's mom started getting worried. She went out looking for her daughter. After a while, she heard a voice coming from the woods. It was Sarah, calling for her mom.
Sarah's mom ran towards her and hugged her tightly. She said, “I’m so glad you are safe, Sarah.” 
Sarah smiled and said, “I had the best adventure mom. Thank you for allowing me to go on the mule!”
