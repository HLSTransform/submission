Teddy and his mum were walking in the park. It was a nice, sunny day. Teddy spotted a puppy laying in the grass. He ran to it and started to pet its paw. It felt so soft and furry!
Suddenly, Teddy noticed how filthy the puppy was. It had dirt all over its fur and its paws were wet and muddy. Teddy gently picked up the puppy and took it back home.
At home, Teddy got out the washcloths and towels. He gave the puppy a nice warm bath. He dried it with the towels, brushed its fur and checked its paws. Then he fed the puppy some yummy food and made a bed where it could sleep.
Finally, Teddy hugged the puppy goodbye and they both went outside for a walk. Teddy wasn't alone anymore. He had a new best friend.
