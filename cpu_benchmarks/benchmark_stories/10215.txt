Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little red house. In the house lived a boy named Tim and his mom. Tim loved to play with his toy cars and trucks.
One sunny day, Tim was playing outside with his toy truck. He saw a big stick on the ground. "I will use this stick to measure how far my truck can go," Tim said. He put the stick next to the truck and pushed it as hard as he could. The truck went very far!
Just then, Tim's mom came outside. "What are you doing, Tim?" she asked. "I'm using this stick to measure how far my truck can go," Tim said proudly. "That's a great idea!" his mom said. Suddenly, a strong wind started to blow. Tim's mom told him, "Let's go inside before the wind strikes us." They went inside their little red house and continued to play together.
