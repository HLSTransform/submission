Mum and Dad took me to the park. We saw lots of birds and animals and Mum said it was fun.
But then something happened. Dad saw an ambulance and he said it was dangerous. Dad wanted to go and help so he said goodbye and ran over to the ambulance.
Mum and I waited and waited. We were very worried because Dad was gone so long. Then we heard sirens and the ambulance drove away very quickly.
"Where is Dad?" I asked.
"He's safe," Mum said. "He finished helping the ambulance drivers and now he's coming back to us." I was so happy and relief when we saw Dad coming back. We waved and he smiled. Then we hugged him and it was the best hug ever.
