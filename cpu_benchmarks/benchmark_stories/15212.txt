Once upon a time, there was a little house with a porch. A girl named Lily lived in the house. She liked to have fun on the porch. She would play with her toys and eat her snacks there.
One day, Lily found a flexible toy snake. It was long and could bend in many ways. Lily loved her new toy. She played with it on the porch all day. She made the snake dance and wiggle around.
Lily's friends saw her playing with the flexible snake. They wanted to have fun too. They all came to the porch and played with the snake. They laughed and had a great time together on the porch. And they all lived happily ever after.
