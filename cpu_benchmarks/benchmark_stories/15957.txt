Once upon a time, there was a sailor named Jack. He loved to sail on his boat in the sea. One day, he saw a little girl on the shore. She was sad because her toy boat was dirty. Jack offered to clean it for her.
The girl was happy and gave him her toy boat. Jack cleaned it with soap and water until it was shiny and clean. The little girl was so happy that she gave Jack a big hug. 
But, when Jack sailed away, he realized that he forgot to put the toy boat back on the shore. He felt bad because he spoiled the little girl's happiness. So, he turned his boat around and went back to the shore to give her the toy boat. 
The little girl was so happy that she gave Jack a big smile. Jack felt happy too because he made her happy again. From that day on, Jack always made sure to double-check everything before he sailed away.
