Once upon a time, there was a big dog. His name was Max. Max liked to play with his ball. One day, Max's ball hit a vase and it broke. The vase split into two pieces. Max's owner was sad, but Max didn't know why.
Max's owner got out a mop to clean up the broken vase. The mop was big and blue. Max watched as his owner cleaned up the mess. The mop made a noisy sound as it wiped the floor. Max didn't like the noise, so he went outside to play with his ball.
From that day on, Max was more careful when playing with his ball. He didn't want to break anything else. And when his owner used the mop, Max stayed outside so he wouldn't hear the noisy sound.
