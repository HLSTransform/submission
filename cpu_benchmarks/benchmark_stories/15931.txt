Once there was a penguin named Sam. Sam was a compassionate penguin who always tried hard to help others. One day, Sam noticed that some of his animal friends had no homes, so he decided to try and help them find a place to stay.
Sam set off on a mission to find his animal friends a cozy place to live. He searched and searched until he finally spotted something special in the distance. It was an igloo! Sam was so excited to see it.
Sam quickly rushed to his animal friends and told them about the igloo. They were all so grateful for Sam's help. Together, they decided to try and move into the igloo. With lots of effort and patience, Sam and his animal friends managed to settle into their lovely new igloo.
The animal friends were so happy and thanked Sam for his compassion. "You are the best," said one of the animals. Sam smiled and said, "Thank you, I just wanted to help."
