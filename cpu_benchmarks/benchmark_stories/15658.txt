Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue wanted to know more about the world around her.
One day, Sue asked her mom, "Mommy, what is a line?" Her mom patiently replied, "A line is something that starts at the beginning and ends at the end."
Curiously, Sue asked, "What does a line look like?" Her mom answered, "It looks like a thin line, like a ray of light in the sky." Sue then said, "How does a light fit in a line?"
Her mom smiled and said, "It can go in a line, like a train going down a railroad track. It can be different sizes and shapes, but when it fits in the line, it looks like a wonderful picture."
After hearing that explanation, Sue thought for a moment before saying, "That is so neat!"
From then on, Sue understood what a line was and how light could fit in it. She began to notice lines and light in her everyday life, and it made her very happy.
