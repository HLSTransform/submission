Once there was a stubborn little pig. He was always looking for an escape from his job. One day he heard about a special petting zoo far away. It was a place filled with animals that could be hugged and played with. 
The little pig was excited. He set off right away on a big adventure. But it was so far away and the road was long and twisty. He stumbled and bumped into things along the way. 
Finally, after a long journey, the little pig reached the petting zoo. He smiled from ear to ear as he got to hug the animals and play with them. He had escaped his job and was so happy. 
The little pig stayed at the petting zoo for many months, until finally he made his way back home. He was very happy to have escaped his job for a while and was so glad that he was so stubborn.
