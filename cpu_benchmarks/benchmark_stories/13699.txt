Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park with her mom. She saw a big event happening there. She asked her mom, "What's happening, Mommy?" Her mom replied, "There's a big party happening in the park today, Lily."
Lily was so excited to see the party. She ran towards the party and discovered that there were many fun activities to do. She saw a man doing flexible moves and asked him, "How are you so flexible?" The man replied, "I practice every day to be flexible like this."
Lily enjoyed the party and made some new friends. She went back home and told her dad about the event she went to. Her dad was happy that she had a fun day. From that day on, Lily practiced being flexible like the man she saw at the party. She discovered that it was fun to try new things.
