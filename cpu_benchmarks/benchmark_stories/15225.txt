Once upon a time, there was a big bear named Bob. Bob lived in a wide forest. He had rough fur and loved to march around the trees. One sunny day, he met a tiny bird named Tim.
"Hi, I am Tim!" said the tiny bird. "Do you want to play with me?" Bob nodded and they began to march together. They marched up and down, and all around the wide forest. They had lots of fun.
But as they marched, they did not see a big hole in the ground. Oh no! Both Bob and Tim fell into the hole. They tried to get out, but the hole was too deep. They were stuck and could not play anymore. And so, Bob and Tim stayed in the hole, sad that their fun day had come to a bad ending.
