Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the snow. One day, Lily decided to have a picnic for lunch. She packed a sandwich, some fruit, and a juice box.
As she was eating her lunch, Lily saw a squirrel running by. She wanted to share her lunch with the squirrel, so she threw a piece of bread to him. Suddenly, the squirrel stopped and froze. Lily was confused and didn't know why the squirrel wasn't moving.
Then, Lily realized that the squirrel was trying to hide the bread in his cheeks because he was rich and wanted to save it for later. Lily laughed and continued to enjoy her lunch in the snow.
