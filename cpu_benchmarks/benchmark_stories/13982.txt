Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved her mommy and daddy very much. One day, they planned to go to the park to play. But it started to rain and they had to delay their trip.
Lily was sad because she wanted to go to the park. But her mommy and daddy said it was fine, they could play inside instead. They played with toys and sang songs together.
Lily felt happy because she was with her mommy and daddy who loved her very much. She didn't mind the delay anymore because she was having fun with her family. The end.
