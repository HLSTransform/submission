One day, Mary went to the park. She was feeling very nervous. She looked around and saw an old tree with deep roots. Mary wanted to stay and explore the tree.
So, Mary walked up to the tree and put both of her hands on the bark. It felt warm and rough. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The smells of the park filled her nose. 
Mary bent down and put her hand on one of the tree's roots. She hoped it would help her stay calm. As she touched the root, she felt better. Her nerves began to disappear.
Mary stayed at the tree for a long time, just exploring and touching the roots. She felt peaceful and safe. Finally, when it was time to go home, Mary said goodbye to the old tree and thanked it for helping her stay calm.
