Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a kitten named Mittens who was very small and cute. One day, Lily went outside to play and forgot to close the door. Mittens saw the open door and ran outside to explore.
Lily looked everywhere but couldn't find Mittens. She was very sad and cried a lot. She remembered that she should have closed the door and felt very guilty.
After a while, Lily went outside and saw a mighty dog chasing Mittens. She was scared but remembered that she had to be brave to save her kitten. She ran towards the dog and scared him away. Mittens was safe and sound, and Lily learned to always remember to close the door and be brave when needed.
