Once upon a time there was a very nice little boy. His name was Bobby. Bobby was very happy. One day he wanted to go to the sea.
So Bobby and his mommy got on a boat and sailed away. When they got to the sea it was very beautiful. The colors were all different and the waves were high. Bobby was so excited that he jumped up and down.
The sea was very deep and it was very difficult to go inside. His mommy hugged him and told him not to worry. Bobby felt better and smiled. 
They sailed around the sea and Bobby saw lots of wonderful animals. Some were swimming and some were playing. He even saw a big whale splash near the boat. Bobby was so excited that he shouted 'wee!'
Eventually the boat sailed back to the shore and Bobby kissed his mommy. Even though it had been a difficult day, Bobby was happy and full of joy. He had had a great day by the sea.
