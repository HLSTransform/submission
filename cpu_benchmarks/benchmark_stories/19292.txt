Once upon a time a little girl called True was playing in her garden. She saw a big, dangerous bee. It frightened her and she ran away. True was so scared that she quickly went inside her house and told her mommy about the bee. 
Her mommy knew how to keep True safe. She gently reminded True that if she saw any more dangerous bees, she should just stay away from them and tell an adult. True nodded her head and promised to tell her mommy if she ever saw one again. 
On the way back to her garden, True was reminded by her mommy to stay away from any dangerous things. True was brave and ran into the garden, knowing that she was safe. True was reminded to be careful and to never forget her mommy's advice. 
True looked around the garden, but she never saw a dangerous bee again.
