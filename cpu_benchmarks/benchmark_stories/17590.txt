Once upon a time, there was a small monkey named Jack. Jack loved to eat bananas. One day, Jack saw a big banana tree in the forest. He wanted to eat the bananas on the tree, but they were too high for him to reach.
Jack met a friendly elephant and asked him, "Can you help me get the bananas from the tree? They are too high for me to reach." The elephant replied, "Sure, I can help you. But be careful, don't mind the bees around the bananas."
Jack and the elephant went to the banana tree. The elephant picked the bananas and gave them to Jack. Jack was happy and thanked the elephant. He ate the bananas and shared some with his new friend. From that day on, Jack and the elephant became good friends and always helped each other.
