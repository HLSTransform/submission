Tim and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big slide. Tim wants to go on the slide, but Mia is scared.
"Come on, Mia, it is fun!" Tim says. "You can do it!"
Mia shakes her head. "No, Tim, it is too high. I will fall and hurt myself."
Tim smiles. "No, you will not. I will help you. I will go first, and then you can follow me. Trust me, Mia, you will succeed!"
Tim climbs up the stairs and slides down. He laughs and claps his hands. "See, Mia, it is easy! Your turn now!"
Mia looks at Tim. He is happy and brave. She is envious. She wants to be like him. She takes a deep breath and decides to try. She climbs up the stairs and slides down. She feels the wind in her hair and the sun on her face. She lands on the ground and smiles. She did it!
"Wow, Mia, you are amazing!" Tim says. "You are not scared anymore!"
Mia hugs Tim. "Thank you, Tim, for helping me. You are a good friend. I am proud of myself. I feel safe and happy!"
They both laugh and run to the slide again. They have fun and enjoy the day. They are both proud and happy. They are both good friends.
