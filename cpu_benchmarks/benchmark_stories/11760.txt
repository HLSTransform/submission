Once upon a time there was a little girl called Susie. But at school, her teacher always called her Susie cauliflower. She was tired of this and one day, she decided to do something about it.
She went to school with a plan. She knew that her teacher did not like the cauliflower in the school garden, so she decided to pick it up and bring it to her teacher. When Susie reached the garden, the cauliflower was there, but it was dirty and filthy.
Susie was brave and she whispered to the cauliflower, “Come with me! Let us show my teacher how beautiful you are.”
The cauliflower listened to Susie, so they went together and reached Susie's teacher. Her teacher was surprised to see the dirty cauliflower but when Susie told her teacher how she found it and how she wanted to show her its beauty, her teacher's heart melted.
From that day on, Susie's teacher never called her Susie cauliflower again. Therefore, the moral of this story is that even if something looks dirty, it always has its own beauty, and kindness can bring out the best in anyone.
