Lily and Sam are playing with paper. They like to fold the paper and make shapes. Lily folds a paper into a fan. She waves it in front of her face.
"Look, Sam, I made a fan. It is hot today. The fan makes me cool," Lily says.
Sam folds a paper into a boat. He puts it in a bowl of water. He blows on it and makes it move.
"Look, Lily, I made a boat. It can sail on the water. The boat is fast," Sam says.
Lily and Sam want to make more shapes. They look for more paper. They see a big paper on the table. It has many words and pictures on it.
"Can we use this paper?" Lily asks.
"No, we can't. That is Mom's paper. She needs it for work. She said we can't touch it," Sam says.
But Lily does not listen. She takes the paper and folds it into a hat. She puts it on her head.
"Look, Sam, I made a hat. It is funny. The hat has words and pictures on it," Lily says.
Sam is scared. He knows Mom will be angry. He tries to take the paper from Lily. They pull and tug. The paper rips.
"Oh no, we broke Mom's paper. She will be mad. What can we do?" Sam says.
Lily has an idea. She takes a rub and tries to fix the paper. She rubs the paper with the rub. The paper gets sticky and messy.
"Look, Sam, I fixed Mom's paper. It is good now. The rub makes it stick together," Lily says.
Sam is not happy. He knows Mom will not like it. He hears Mom coming. He hides under the table. Lily smiles and waits for Mom. She wants to show her the paper. She thinks Mom will be proud.
