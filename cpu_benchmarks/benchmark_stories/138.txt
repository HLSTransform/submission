Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a purple dress that she loved to wear. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While they were playing, Lily saw a butterfly that was also purple. She said, "Look, a purple butterfly! I want to watch it." 
Her friend Emma said, "I want to watch it too!" They both sat down and watched the butterfly together. After a while, Lily said, "I'm tired. I want to sleep now." Emma said, "Okay, let's go home and take a nap." 
When they got home, Lily put on her purple pajamas and went to bed. She said goodnight to her mom and dad, and soon she was fast asleep. She dreamed about the purple butterfly and how much fun she had watching it with Emma. The end.
