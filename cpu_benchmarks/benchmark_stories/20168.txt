Tim and Lily are twins. They like to play pretend. Today, they want to be cops. They dress in blue shirts and hats. They use toy badges and walkie-talkies.
They go outside and look for bad guys. They see a cat on a fence. Tim says, "Look, Lily, a bad guy. He is stealing a bird's nest." Lily says, "Let's catch him, Tim. We are good cops."
They run to the fence and try to climb it. The cat sees them and hisses. He jumps off the fence and runs away. Tim and Lily fall off the fence and land on the grass. They laugh and get up.
They hear a siren. They see a real cop car on the street. The cop stops and gets out. He smiles and walks to them. He says, "Hello, kids. What are you doing?" Tim and Lily say, "We are playing cops. We are catching bad guys." The cop says, "That's very nice. But be careful. Don't climb on fences. You might get hurt."
He gives them stickers with stars and says, "You are good kids. And good cops. Keep up the good work." He gets back in his car and drives away. Tim and Lily wave and say, "Bye, cop. Thank you." They stick the stickers on their shirts and hats. They are happy. They go back to play.
