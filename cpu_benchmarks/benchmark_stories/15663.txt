Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lala. She liked to explore and go on fun adventures. One day, she went to a park with a pond. She stepped carefully up to the edge of the pond and looked at the still, quiet water. Suddenly, she heard a voice say, "Hello Lala!"
Lala jumped and looked around. She didn't see anyone. Then, she heard the voice again. It was coming from the water!
"It's me!" said a fish, popping its head above the surface. He smiled at Lala. "Come in and play!"
Lala thought for a moment and then slowly stepped into the water. It was cold, but it felt nice. She and the fish splashed and played for a long time.
When she was finished, Lala said goodbye to her new friend and stepped out of the water. She felt happy and excited about her adventure, and looked forward to exploring more!
