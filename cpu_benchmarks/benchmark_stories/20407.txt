Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she saw a shiny oyster on the beach. She picked it up and promised to take care of it forever. 
Lily brought the oyster home and put it in a special place. Every day, she would talk to the oyster and tell it how grateful she was to have found it. 
One day, Lily's friend came over and saw the oyster. She wanted it for herself and tried to take it away. But Lily remembered her promise and told her friend that she couldn't have it. 
Lily's friend was sad, but Lily felt proud of herself for keeping her promise. She learned that it's important to be grateful for what you have and to keep your promises.
