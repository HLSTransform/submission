Ben was a smart boy who liked to learn new things. He had a big book with many pictures and words. He liked to look at the book and ask his mom what the words meant. He learned about animals, colors, shapes, and numbers.
One day, he saw a picture of a star in his book. He pointed at it and asked his mom, "What is this?"
"That is a star, Ben. It is a bright light in the sky at night. You can see many stars when it is dark and clear," his mom said.
"Can I touch a star?" Ben asked.
"No, Ben. Stars are very far away. You can only look at them, but you cannot touch them," his mom said.
Ben was curious. He wanted to see a star up close. He had an idea. He took his flashlight from his pocket and turned it on. He pointed it at the wall and made a small dot of light.
"Look, mom. I have a star," he said.
His mom smiled. She was proud of Ben's imagination. She played along and said, "Wow, Ben. You are very smart. You made your own star. But be careful. Don't blink or it might go away."
Ben laughed. He blinked his eyes and saw the dot of light disappear. He blinked again and saw it come back. He had fun making his star blink on and off. He felt happy and hugged his mom. He said, "I love you, mom. And I love stars."
