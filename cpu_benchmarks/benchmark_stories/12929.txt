Cindy was a three year old with lots of energy. She loved playing in the gym with her parents and friends. She enjoyed counting rings and running around the play equipment. On this particular day, Cindy was feeling particularly worried about competing in the gym class race.
After the other children had finished their heats, it was Cindy's turn. She got ready on the start line, itching to take off.
"Don't worry, you can do it!" said her Mum, with a smile.
Cindy's heart raced as the whistle was blown. She ran as fast as she could, leaving the other children behind. When she crossed the finish line, everyone cheered and applauded! She was so relieved.
But Cindy's happiness was short lived. As she looked around, she noticed that none of the other children had crossed the finish line. They were all still running around. She felt envious of the admiration they were getting.
Turns out the other children had misunderstood the race start, and were running around in circles, much to everyone's amusement. Cindy laughed too. From then on, she never worried about running the gym class race.
