Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his blocks. He wanted to build a big tower with them. But every time he tried, the tower would fall down. This made Tim feel frustrated.
One day, Tim's friend, Sue, came to play with him. Sue saw Tim's tower and said, "I can help you complete it!" Tim was happy to have Sue's help. They started to build the tower together.
With Sue's help, Tim was able to complete the tower. The result was a big, tall tower that didn't fall down. Tim and Sue were so happy. They clapped and laughed. They played with the tower all day long. And Tim was not frustrated anymore.
