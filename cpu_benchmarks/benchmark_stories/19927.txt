Once upon a time, there was a dog named Max. Max had a very shiny, smooth collar that he loved to wear. One day, Max's owner took him for a walk in the park. While they were walking, Max saw another dog with a collar that was not as shiny as his. Max started to complain to his owner that he wanted a new collar that was even shinier than his current one. 
Max's owner explained to him that it's not nice to complain and that he should be happy with what he has. Max thought about it and realized that his collar was already very special and he didn't need a new one. From that day on, Max was happy with his shiny, smooth collar and never complained again.
