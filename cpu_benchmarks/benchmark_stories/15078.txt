Once upon a time there was a big elf. He wanted to fix a reindeer. But it was not easy. The elf tried and tried for a very long time, but he couldn’t repair the reindeer.
The elf was very persistent. He kept trying every day to repair the reindeer. But try as he might he couldn’t do it.
One day a little child saw the elf. The child knew the elf was trying to repair the reindeer. So the child called out, “Can I help you?”
The elf smiled. “Yes, I would like that!”
The elf and the child worked together. With the child’s help, the elf was able to repair the reindeer.
The elf was so happy and gave the child a big hug. “Thank you for helping me!" The elf said.
The little child smiled and said, “You’re welcome!”. Then the little child and the reindeer ran off happily.
