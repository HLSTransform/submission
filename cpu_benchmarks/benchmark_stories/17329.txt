Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys all day long. One day, her mommy gave her a big box with a shiny phone inside. Lily was very happy and started playing with it right away.
But one day, Lily's mommy noticed that the phone was missing. She looked everywhere, but she couldn't find it. Lily was sad because she loved her phone so much. Then, her mommy had an idea. She asked Lily to help her wrap a present for her deaf friend.
Lily was excited to help her mommy wrap the present. They put colorful paper and a big bow on it. When they finished, Lily's mommy asked her to put the present in the mailbox. When they got back inside, Lily's mommy surprised her by giving her back her phone. Lily was so happy and hugged her mommy tight. She learned that sometimes, good things can come from helping others.
