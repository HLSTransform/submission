Mum and Dad were very jolly as they got ready for the evening. Dad said, "Let's go unlock the secret room!"
The little girl was excited and followed them. She asked lots of questions as they went.
When they arrived to the secret room, Dad opened the door and said, "Hurry inside!"
The little girl was so surprised to see all the fun things in the room. She could hardly believe it.
But then Dad said, "Now it's time to lock it up again."
The little girl was sad as Dad locked the door and she knew that she couldn't get back inside.
"Goodbye secret room," she sighed as Mum and Dad walked away.
