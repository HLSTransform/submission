Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to fly. She had a special black room in her house where she did her flying. She would leap from the ground, spread her arms and pretend she was a bird!
One day, the little girl told her mom she wanted to fly around the world. Her mom smiled and said, “That's a big dream! You need a magic carpet for that.”
The girl had an idea. She ran to the black room and pulled out a blanket. Then she jumped on the blanket and yelled, “Take me to the world!”
But the blanket didn't move…
The girl's dad came over to help. He smiled and said, “Let's try this. Close your eyes and flap your arms.” 
The girl closed her eyes and flapped her arms as hard as she could. Suddenly, she felt herself rising off the ground. She opened her eyes and saw that she was flying! 
She flew out the window, over the trees and around the world. The little girl laughed and shouted, “I'm flying!” 
The girl made it back home before dinner and from then on, she flew around her black room every day.
