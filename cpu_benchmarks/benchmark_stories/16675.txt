Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to wear her yellow dress with flowers on it. One day, Lily went to the park to play with her friends. She saw a big dog with a yellow pattern on its fur.
Lily's friend, Tommy, asked her if she was scared of the big dog. "No," said Lily. "I trust that the dog is friendly." Tommy was surprised that Lily wasn't scared of the big dog. "Why do you trust the dog?" he asked.
Lily replied, "I can see a pattern in the dog's behavior. It wags its tail and licks its lips. That means it wants to play with us." Tommy was amazed by Lily's observation and they both played with the big dog happily. From that day on, Lily and Tommy trusted each other's instincts and became the best of friends.
