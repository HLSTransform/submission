Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They have a ball, a bike and a bell. The bell is on the bike. Lily likes to ring the bell. Ben likes to ride the bike.
One day, they go to the park. Lily says, "Can I ring the bell?" Ben says, "Yes, you can. But be careful. Do not ring it too loud. Some people do not like loud noises." Lily nods. She takes the bell and rings it softly. It makes a nice sound.
Ben gets on the bike. He pedals fast. He feels the wind on his face. He smiles. He sees a big hill. He wants to go down the hill. He thinks it will be fun.
But he is careless. He does not look where he is going. He does not see a dog. The dog is sleeping on the grass. Ben rides the bike over the dog. The dog wakes up. The dog is angry. It barks and chases Ben.
Lily hears the dog. She sees Ben. She is scared. She rings the bell loud. She hopes the dog will stop. But the dog does not stop. It runs faster.
Ben hears the bell. He looks back. He sees the dog. He is scared too. He tries to pedal faster. But he loses his balance. He falls off the bike. He hurts his knee. He cries.
Lily runs to Ben. She drops the bell. She hugs Ben. She says, "I am sorry. I wanted to help you. Are you okay?" Ben says, "I am okay. But my knee hurts. And the bike is broken. And the dog is still here." They look at the dog. The dog is not angry anymore. It is wagging its tail. It licks Ben's knee. It wants to play.
Lily and Ben learn a lesson. They learn to be careful. They learn to look where they are going. They learn to respect the dog. They also learn to share. They give the dog the ball. The dog is happy. They are happy too. They are still friends.
