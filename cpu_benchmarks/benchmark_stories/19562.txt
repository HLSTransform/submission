Once there was a little boy who loved to play outside in the sunshine. Every day he would go to the park and run and jump and play tag with all the animals.
One day he went to the park, but instead of it being sunny and warm, it was cloudy and misty. But the little boy didn't give up hope. He walked through the mist and saw something sparkling in the fog.
He picked it up and found it was a beautiful little blanket. He wrapped the blanket around himself and it made him feel warm and cozy, even in the mist.
Then he sat down on a park bench and looked through the mist. He saw all the little animals playing in the mist and laughed. He felt so content and happy.
The little boy wanted to remember this moment forever, so he wrapped his blanket tightly around him and made a wish. He wished he could stay forever in this misty and magical place.
