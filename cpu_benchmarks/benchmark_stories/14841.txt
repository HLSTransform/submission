Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a white cat named Snowy. One day, Lily went to the market with her mommy. She saw a big red apple and asked her mommy to buy it. Her mommy said, "Sure, we can buy the apple." 
When they got home, Lily's mommy washed the apple and gave it to her. Lily took a big bite and said, "Yum, this apple is delicious!" Snowy came over and meowed, "Meow, can I have some too?" Lily giggled and said, "No, Snowy, apples are for people, not cats!" 
After finishing her apple, Lily went to play with her toys. Snowy followed her and sat next to her. She petted Snowy and said, "You're such a good cat, Snowy. I love you." Snowy purred and cuddled with Lily. They both felt happy and content.
