Once upon a time, there was a selfish dog. He liked to order others around. He always wanted his own way.
One day, the dog saw a bubble. It was so pretty and sparkly! He wanted it very much. He ordered the bubble to come to him, but the bubble just floated away.
So the dog chased the bubble. He ran and he ran but he could not catch it. Everywhere the bubble went, the dog followed. He wanted the bubble for himself.
At last, the bubble disappeared. The selfish dog was very sad. He learnt a lesson that day - being mean and selfish doesn't get you very far.
