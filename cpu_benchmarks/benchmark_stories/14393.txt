Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Benny. Benny loved to bounce around in the grass. One day, Benny's mom gave him a task to find some carrots for dinner. Benny hopped along, looking for some tasty carrots. He saw a gray rock and thought it was a carrot, but it wasn't. Benny kept searching and finally found some yummy orange carrots. He was so happy that he bounced all the way back home to show his mom. She was proud of Benny for completing his task and finding the carrots. From that day on, Benny knew that if he worked hard and kept looking, he could find what he was looking for.
