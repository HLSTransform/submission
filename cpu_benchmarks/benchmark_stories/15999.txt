The sun shone brightly in the sky and two best friends were playing in the park. One had a nice collar on, which made her look quite special compared to the other.
“I like your collar,” said the first friend.
“Thank you. It’s really nice!” replied the other.
“Do you want to wear it too?”
“Yes, I value that!” beamed the first friend and put the collar around her friend’s neck.
The two friends kept playing, but the second one felt extra special with the nice collar. They were having so much fun!
The first friend saw that her friend was particularly happy and so she said “I value you so much!”
“I value you too!” replied the friend with the collar.
The two friends hugged each other tightly to seal their bond of true friendship.  They both knew that no matter what, they would always value each other.
