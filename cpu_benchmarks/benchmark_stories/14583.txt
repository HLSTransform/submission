Once upon a time there was a soft dancer. She was a magical creature who loved to dance. Everywhere she went, people stopped to admire her graceful moves.
One day, the magical dancer wanted to show everyone how she could dance in the sky. She twirled and leapt, soaring as high as she could.
Suddenly, her friends appeared in the sky. They were all dressed in brightly coloured costumes and each carried a piece of shimmering fabric. Together, they wove a beautiful rainbow pattern into the sky.
The dancer smiled and waved to her friends as they flew around her. Everyone below cheered with excitement, feeling the joy and beauty of the magical dancing.
After the performance was over, the dancer smiled and waved goodbye to her friends before they all disappeared over the horizon.
