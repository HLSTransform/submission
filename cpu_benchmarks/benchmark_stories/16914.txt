Tom and Ann are husband and wife. They live in a big house with a dog and a cat. Tom works in a bank and Ann works in a school. They are happy and love each other.
One day, Tom comes home from work and sees a letter on the table. He opens the letter and reads it. It is from a lawyer. The letter says that Ann wants to sign a paper to end their marriage. Tom is very sad and angry. He does not understand why Ann wants to do this.
He goes to the phone and calls Ann. He says, "Ann, why did you send me this letter? Why do you want to sign this paper? Don't you love me anymore?"
Ann answers, "Tom, I'm sorry, but I don't want to be your wife anymore. I met someone else. He is nice and makes me happy. You are bad and make me sad. You work too much and don't talk to me. You don't care about me or the dog or the cat. I want to sign this paper and be free."
Tom cries and says, "Ann, please, don't do this. I love you and I care about you and the dog and the cat. I work hard to give you a good life. I can change and be nice and make you happy. Please, don't sign this paper. Give me another chance."
Ann says, "No, Tom, it's too late. I made up my mind. I'm going to sign this paper and be with him. Goodbye, Tom."
She hangs up the phone and leaves Tom alone in the big house with the dog and the cat. Tom feels very bad and does not know what to do. He hugs the dog and the cat and hopes that Ann will change her mind and come back. But she does not. She signs the paper and leaves him forever.
