George was a shy boy. He was walking in the park with his rod. He saw a bunny hopping around, so he smiled and said "Hi Bunny". Bunny looked at him and George waved. Bunny was very shy too! Then George had a great idea. He said "Let's play a joke!" He made his rod into an airplane shape and started to fly it around the park. Bunny laughed and hopped after him trying to play too. They had a lot of fun with the joke and before they knew it, the sun was setting. George said goodbye with a smile and went home. Everyone in the park had a good laugh that day thanks to George's silly joke!
