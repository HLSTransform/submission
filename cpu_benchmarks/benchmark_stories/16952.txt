Lily and Tom were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big puddle on the grass. They ran to the puddle and jumped in it. They made a lot of splashes and noises.
"Look at me, I'm a frog!" Lily said. She bent her knees and hopped in the puddle. "Ribbit, ribbit!"
"I'm a frog too!" Tom said. He copied Lily and hopped in the puddle. "Ribbit, ribbit!"
They repeated the words and the jumps many times. They had a lot of fun.
Then they saw a man with a camera. He was walking by the puddle. He stopped and looked at them.
"Hello, kids. Can I take a picture of you?" he asked. He smiled and held up his camera.
"Why?" Lily asked. She was curious.
"Because you are very cute and funny. And because I work for a magazine. A magazine is a book with many pictures and stories. Maybe you can be in the magazine and be famous. Famous means that many people know you and like you." he explained.
"Wow, really?" Tom asked. He was excited.
"Yes, really. But only if you want to. And only if your mom or dad say yes." he said.
Lily and Tom looked at each other. They nodded. They wanted to be in the magazine and be famous. They thought it would be cool.
They ran to their mom, who was sitting on a bench nearby. They told her about the man and the camera and the magazine. They asked her if they could be in the picture.
Their mom looked at the man. He showed her his badge and his magazine. He seemed nice and honest. She agreed to let them be in the picture.
She walked with them to the puddle. The man asked them to hop in the puddle again and say "ribbit, ribbit". He took many pictures of them. He thanked them and gave them his card. He said he would send them a copy of the magazine when it was ready.
Lily and Tom were very happy. They hugged their mom and thanked the man. They hoped to see their picture soon. They wondered if they would be famous. They felt like frogs.
