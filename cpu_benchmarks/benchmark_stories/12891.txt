Once there was a girl named Milly. She was three years old and loved to play. One day, however, she was feeling dull and bored. Her best friend, Louie, asked her why she was not having fun.
Milly sighed. "I don't have anything to play with," she said.
"Let's go find something!" Louie said excitedly. They searched around and eventually found a box filled with toys.
"We can own these!" she said. Louie nodded in agreement.
Milly and Louie began to play with the toys. They built castles and pretended they were kings and queens. Suddenly they heard a noise in the distance. It was coming from the box!
They looked inside to find a friendly little mouse who had been hiding in the box. He had been looking for a place to live.
Milly and Louie were so excited. They gave the mouse a home and made him their friend.
With this new friend, Milly and Louie had lots of fun. They played all day long and never felt dull again.
