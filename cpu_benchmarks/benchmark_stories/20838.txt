Mama and Papa were very glad. They had just bought a new bookshelf for their little girl's bedroom.
The bookshelf was big and strong. It had lots of shelves for books, toys, and special things.
Mama and Papa helped their little girl put the bookshelf together. Then they placed it near her bed.
Their little girl was so thrilled. She gave her mama and papa big hugs and thanked them.
Then she grabbed a stuffed animal and sat on her bookshelf. She was so glad to have a comfy new seat in her room!
