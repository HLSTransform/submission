The little girl was playing with a ball in the garden. She was so happy and excited to have it. She hugged the ball and smiled. Suddenly her dad came outside. He said, “Where did you get that ball?! It’s mine!”
The little girl was scared. She didn’t know what to do. She said, “I found it on the ground.”
Her dad said, “I lost it a few days ago. Bad girl, giving back my ball!”
The little girl was sad. She didn’t want to lose her ball. She started to cry and said, “No, I don’t want to give it back!”
Her dad felt bad. He said, “OK, you can have the ball but next time if something belongs to someone else, you have to give it back. That’s the nice thing to do.”
The little girl was happy. She said, “Thank you, Daddy!” She hugged the ball and smiled. She had won the ball back!
