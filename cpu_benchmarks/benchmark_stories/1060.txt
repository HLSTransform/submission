Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She loved enjoying the outdoors, especially on stormy days. Every time the sky became grey, Sarah would run outside and jump in puddles and watch the lightning.
One stormy day, Sarah went to the park with her mom. She was so excited to be outside. They enjoyed throwing a ball around, but then the rain started to come down harder. Mom said it was time to go home.
When Sarah and her mom got home, Mom said it was time for Sarah to shut her eyes and take a nap. She was so tired from playing in the rain! Sarah soon drifted off to sleep, dreaming of lightning and yummy snacks.
When Sarah woke up, her mom had made her a special treat. Sarah was thrilled to see her plate of her favorite food - scrambled eggs with toast. She quickly ate every bite and smiled with joy.
From then on, Sarah loved storms and the sound of the rain on her window. She loved going outside to play in the rain and watching the lightning. Sarah knew that no matter what, she would always be safe and cozy in bed with her mom.
