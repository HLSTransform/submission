Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to eat candy, and he ate it all the time. One day, Timmy's mom said, "Timmy, you can't eat candy all the time. It's not good for you." But Timmy didn't listen.
Later that day, Timmy was watching television when suddenly, the TV stopped working. "Oh no!" Timmy cried. "What happened to the TV?" His mom replied, "I think it's broken. We'll have to get it fixed." Timmy was sad because he loved watching TV.
The next day, Timmy's mom took him to the candy store. Timmy was so excited to eat his favorite candy. But when they got to the store, Timmy saw a humble old man sitting outside. The old man said, "Excuse me, do you have any spare change?" Timmy's mom gave the old man some money, and Timmy saw how happy it made the old man. From that day on, Timmy realized that it's important to share and help others, instead of just thinking about himself and eating candy all the time.
