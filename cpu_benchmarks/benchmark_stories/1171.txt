Once upon a time, there was a graceful cat named Lily. Lily was very pretty and loved to play with her friends. One day, she found a long cut on her leg. Lily was sad and didn't know what to do.
Lily went to her friend, Sam the dog. Sam was very smart and always helped his friends. "Sam, I have a cut on my leg. Can you help me?" Lily asked. Sam looked at the cut and said, "Yes, I can help you. I will lead you to the doctor."
Sam led Lily to the doctor's house. The doctor was a wise owl named Dr. Hoot. Dr. Hoot looked at the cut and said, "Don't worry, Lily. I will fix it." Dr. Hoot put a bandage on the cut and gave Lily a hug. Lily felt better and thanked Sam and Dr. Hoot.
Lily, Sam, and Dr. Hoot played together all day. They were happy and had lots of fun. Lily's leg was all better, and she was grateful for her friends who helped her.
