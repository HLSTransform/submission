Once upon a time, there was a big hippo. The hippo was very happy and liked to do many things. One day, the hippo wanted to play with a light ball. The hippo asked his friend, a little bird, to help him find a light ball to play with. They looked and looked, but they couldn't find a light ball. Suddenly, the little bird had an idea. The bird said, "Let's make our own light ball!" The hippo was so happy and said, "That's a great idea!" So, they got some paper and made a big, light ball. They played with it all day and had so much fun. From that day on, the hippo and the little bird did many more fun things together.
