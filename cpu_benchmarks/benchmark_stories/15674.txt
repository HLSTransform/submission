Once there was a family who had a 3-year-old. The 3-year-old's name was Jack. Jack loved learning. His parents wanted to teach him something new, so one day they bought a helicopter. Jack was so excited!
The first time Jack saw it he said, "Wow, it's so cool!" His parents smiled and said "Yes, it's very cool. And do you know what it is?" Jack shook his head. They said, "It's a helicopter! We're going to teach you how to fly it."
Jack was very happy. He asked, "Can I fly it? Do I have to work hard?" His parents smiled and said, "Yes, Jack. You'll have to work very hard to learn how to fly it. But we'll help you and we know you can do it!"
Jack started learning right away. He practiced flying the helicopter and soon he was going higher and higher. He had worked very hard, and he was doing great! Now Jack is an expert at flying and he teaches his friends how to do it too.
