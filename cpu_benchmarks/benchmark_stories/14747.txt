Sara and Tom were friends who liked to play outside. They had a group of toys that they shared. One day, they found a new toy in the grass. It was a star that could shine in different colors.
"Wow, look at this!" Sara said. "It is so pretty and bright. Can I have it?"
Tom looked at the star and liked it too. He wanted to play with it too. But he saw that Sara was very happy. He was a humble boy who did not like to fight.
"Okay, you can have it," he said. "But can we take turns?"
Sara smiled and hugged Tom. She was a kind girl who liked to share.
"Of course, we can take turns," she said. "You are a good friend. Thank you."
They played with the star for a long time. They made it shine in different colors and shapes. They had a lot of fun. They put the star in their group of toys and promised to play with it again. They were happy and grateful.
