Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She liked to write letters to her friends and family. One day, she found a thread on the ground and decided to use it to make a bracelet. She was very calm while she made it.
But then, a big dog came and scared Lily. She dropped her bracelet and ran away. The dog picked up the thread and started to chew on it. The thread broke and the bracelet was ruined.
Lily was very sad when she found out what happened. She wanted to write a letter to the dog's owner, but she didn't know who it was. She never made another bracelet again.
