Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside. One day, he went for a walk in the woods. He saw a bush and walked up to it. He stared at the bush for a long time. Suddenly, he heard a voice.
"Hello, little boy," said the bush.
Timmy was surprised. "Did you just talk?" he asked.
"Yes, I did," said the bush. "I am a magical bush. I can grant wishes."
"Wow, that's helpful," said Timmy. "Can you grant me a wish?"
"Of course," said the bush. "What do you want?"
"I want a puppy," said Timmy.
"Your wish is granted," said the bush.
Suddenly, a cute little puppy appeared in front of Timmy. He was so happy. He thanked the bush and went home with his new puppy. From that day on, Timmy and his puppy were the best of friends.
