Lily and Max were very happy. They were going to their new home with Mom and Dad. They had a big jeep full of boxes and bags. Mom drove the jeep and Dad sat next to her. Lily and Max sat in the back and looked out the window.
"Look, Max, there is a big park!" Lily said. "We can play there later."
"Yes, and there is a school too!" Max said. "Maybe we can make new friends there."
Soon they arrived at their new home. It was a nice house with a yard and a tree. Mom parked the jeep and Dad opened the door.
"Welcome to our new home, kids!" Dad said. "Let's go inside and unpack."
Lily and Max followed Mom and Dad into the house. They saw a big living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and two bedrooms. One bedroom was for Mom and Dad, and the other was for Lily and Max.
"Wow, this is our room!" Lily said. "It's so big and bright!"
"Yes, and look, we have a bunk bed!" Max said. "I want to sleep on the top!"
"OK, you can sleep on the top, but I get to choose the sheets!" Lily said.
Mom and Dad brought some boxes and bags into their room. They helped Lily and Max unpack their clothes, toys, books, and pictures. They put them in the closet, the drawers, the shelves, and the walls.
"Look, Mom, I found my teddy bear!" Lily said. "I missed him so much!"
"I'm glad you found him, sweetie," Mom said. "He missed you too."
"Look, Dad, I found my car!" Max said. "Can I play with it outside?"
"Sure, buddy, but be careful," Dad said. "Don't go too far from the house."
Lily and Max hugged Mom and Dad and ran outside. They played with their teddy bear and car in the yard. They saw a bird, a flower, and a butterfly. They were very happy in their new home.
