Once there was a little boy named Chris. Chris loved playing in the forest outside his house. One day, Chris decided to explore the forest with his friend Cat. Cat was a brave and mysterious cat.
When they arrived in the forest, Chris saw a strange looking sweater lying near a tree. He picked it up to have a closer look and immediately knew it was the only one of its kind. It was so colorful and beautiful!
"Is that for me, Cat?" Chris asked with excitement.
Cat shook his head. "No, I'm sorry Chris," he replied. "That sweater is special and mystical."
Chris looked disappointed and said, "but I really hate wearing sweaters".
Cat winked at Chris. "Don't worry! You'll be glad you found that sweater when you need it."
Chris had no idea why Cat said that, but he was excited to keep exploring the forest, so he put the sweater in his pocket and kept going. 
Soon enough, Chris got lost in the forest. He was about to give up when he remembered the mysterious sweater in his pocket. He put it on and it lit up brightly, showing Chris the way out. Chris thanked Cat silently as he made his way back to his house.
From then on, Chris never hated sweaters as much as he used to!
