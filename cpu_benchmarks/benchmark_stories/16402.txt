Sara loved to play with her mom's jewelry. She liked to put on the shiny rings and necklaces and pretend she was a princess. One day, when her mom was busy in the kitchen, Sara sneaked into her bedroom and opened the jewelry box. She saw a beautiful bracelet with many colors. She wanted to try it on.
"Wow, this is so pretty!" Sara said to herself. She put the bracelet on her wrist and admired it in the mirror. She felt very happy.
But she did not know that the bracelet was very special. It was a gift from her dad, who was away on a trip. He had bought it for her mom's birthday, which was tomorrow. He had told her mom to keep it a secret until then. He wanted to surprise her.
Sara did not hear her mom coming into the bedroom. She was too busy playing with the bracelet. Her mom saw her and gasped.
"Sara, what are you doing?" her mom asked, sounding angry and sad. "That's not yours. That's mine. You should not touch it. You could break it or lose it. It's very important to me."
Sara felt scared and sorry. She did not mean to make her mom angry or sad. She did not know the bracelet was important. She just wanted to play.
"I'm sorry, mom," Sara said, taking off the bracelet and giving it back to her mom. "I did not know. I just liked it. It's so pretty. Please don't be mad at me."
Her mom sighed and hugged her. She was not really mad at her. She was just worried and disappointed. She loved Sara very much.
"I'm not mad at you, Sara," her mom said. "I know you did not know. But you have to ask me before you touch my things. Especially this bracelet. It's a very special gift from your dad. He bought it for me for my birthday. He will be back tomorrow and we will celebrate together. He will be very happy to see you and me wearing the bracelet. Do you understand?"
Sara nodded. She understood. She felt happy again. She loved her mom and her dad very much. She could not wait to see them both tomorrow. She hoped they would all be happy.
