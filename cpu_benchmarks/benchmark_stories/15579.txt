Ben and Mia have a pet parrot. His name is Coco. Coco can say many words. He likes to say hello, bye, and his own name. He also likes to copy what Ben and Mia say.
One day, Ben and Mia are playing with Coco. They teach him some new words. They say "calm", "happy", and "love". Coco repeats them. He says "calm, calm, happy, happy, love, love". Ben and Mia clap and hug Coco. They are proud of him.
But then, Coco sees a big dog outside the window. The dog is barking loud. Coco gets scared. He forgets the new words. He says "woof, woof, help, help, Coco, Coco". He flaps his wings and squawks. Ben and Mia try to calm him down. They say "shh, shh, it's okay, Coco, it's okay. The dog can't hurt you. You are safe with us. We are calm, happy, and love you".
Coco listens to Ben and Mia. He sees that they are not afraid. He feels their hugs. He calms down. He stops saying "woof, woof, help, help". He says "calm, calm, happy, happy, love, love". He smiles and nuzzles Ben and Mia. They smile and nuzzle him back. They are a happy family.
