He swam and swam until he felt tired so he decided to take a break. Suddenly he heard a loud roar and Leo was very scared. He turned around and he saw a big lion standing on the other side of the river. Leo was so frightened he couldn’t move.
"What are you doing, little lion?" the big lion asked.
Leo replied “I was just taking a swim. Please don’t hurt me.” 
The big lion smiled and said, “No need to be afraid. I'm just here to show you something. But it will only work if you're brave enough to come closer.”
Leo felt a little bit better, so he got closer. But then suddenly the big lion roared again, making Leo jump. However the big lion said, “It's okay little lion. I was just showing you how to swim with the other lions. Do you want to join us?” 
Leo was so excited. He had never seen a lion swimming before and he never thought he could do it. So with a brave heart, he jumped in the river and started to swim with
