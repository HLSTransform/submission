Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to draw and color, and she had a special stamp that she used to make her pictures even more special.
One day, Lily wanted to use her stamp, but she couldn't find it. She looked and looked, but it was nowhere to be found. She was very impatient and started to get upset.
Her mom noticed how upset Lily was and asked her what was wrong. Lily told her about the missing stamp. Her mom reminded her that sometimes things get lost, but if she was patient and looked carefully, she might be able to unlock where it was hiding.
Lily took her mom's advice and looked carefully, and eventually, she found her stamp. She was so happy and learned that being patient and looking carefully can help you find what you are looking for.
