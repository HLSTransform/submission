Tom likes to move. He likes to run and jump and play. He likes to move his toys and his books and his clothes. He likes to move everything in his room.
One day, Tom sees a picture on the wall. It is a picture of a big dog. The dog has brown fur and black spots. The dog has a big smile and a long tongue. Tom thinks the dog is friendly. He wants to play with the dog.
Tom moves a chair to the wall. He climbs on the chair. He reaches for the picture. He wants to take the picture down. He wants to hug the picture. He wants to move the picture to his bed.
But the picture is too high. Tom cannot reach the picture. He stretches his arms. He stands on his toes. He jumps on the chair. He still cannot reach the picture.
Tom is sad. He wants the picture. He cries. He makes a loud noise.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to Tom's room. She sees Tom on the chair. She sees the picture on the wall. She sees Tom's tears.
Mom hugs Tom. She tells him not to cry. She tells him the picture is not a real dog. She tells him the picture is only for looking. She tells him he cannot move the picture. She tells him he can look at the picture and pretend to play with the dog.
Tom listens to Mom. He stops crying. He gets off the chair. He looks at the picture. He smiles. He says hello to the dog. He says the dog is friendly. He says he likes the picture.
Mom smiles. She says she likes the picture too. She says she likes Tom more. She says Tom is friendly. She says Tom is her best boy.
Tom hugs Mom. He says he loves Mom. He says Mom is his best girl.
Mom and Tom are happy. They move to the couch. They read a book. They see more pictures. They see more friendly animals. They have fun.
