Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. While she was playing, she fell down and hurt her knee. 
Her friend, Timmy, saw her crying and asked, "Are you okay, Lily?" 
Lily replied, "No, it hurts a lot." 
Timmy said, "Don't worry, I have some cream that can help you." Timmy took out a small tube of cream from his bag and rubbed it on Lily's knee. 
Lily felt much better and said, "Thank you, Timmy. You are my hero!" Timmy smiled and said, "No problem, Lily. That's what friends are for."
