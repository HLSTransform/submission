Once there was a fisherman. He went out on a boat every day to catch fish. The water was always tight and the wind was strong.
One day, the fisherman saw something in the water. It was a shiny fish! He put it in his fishing net, which he always brought on his boat.
Suddenly, something else came out of the water. It was a crab! It was so tight that the fisherman couldn't get it off the hook.
But then the crab bit the fisherman's hand and ran away. The fisherman chased it and eventually brought it back to the boat. He was so happy!
The fisherman was so proud of what he brought back from the water. He cooked the crab for dinner and watched the sunset. He was happy that he had a successful day fishing.
