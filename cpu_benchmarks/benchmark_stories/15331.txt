Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved playing with her friends. Every day she would gather them together and they would play around her desk. She was always so enthusiastic and smiling.
One day the girl decided to invite all of the kids in her school to join them. She hoped that if everyone was united as one, they would all have more fun. So the girl started telling everyone about her idea and all of her friends got very excited about it.
On the day of the big event all of the kids were at the school, surrounding the big desk. Together, they joined hands and cheered with huge grins on their faces. The girl was so happy, with all of her friends united together.
The girl and her friends had the best time ever and they continued to get together to play around the desk. That time they spent together was always so fun and happy, and they were always so enthusiastic.
Every day the girl was so proud of how they were all united, and she would always smile knowing that the desk brought everyone together.
