Once upon a time, there was a green garden. The sun was shining and the flowers were blooming. A little ant was walking in the garden, looking for food. The ant saw a big leaf and started to carry it back to its home. 
Suddenly, the ant fell down and couldn't get up. A little girl saw the ant and picked it up. She said, "Thank you for visiting my garden, little ant. You are so small and cute." The ant smiled and felt happy. 
The little girl put the ant back on the ground and watched it walk away. She was happy to help the ant and knew that it would be safe in the garden. From that day on, the little girl always looked out for the ants in her garden and made sure they were happy.
