Anna and Ben were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big white pumpkin growing on a vine. They wondered how it got there and who planted it.
"Look, Ben, a white pumpkin!" Anna said. "It is so pretty and round. Can we pick it and make a pie?"
"No, Anna, we can't," Ben said. "It is not ours. It belongs to the witch who lives in the woods. She will be angry if we touch it."
Anna did not believe Ben. She thought he was just trying to scare her. She wanted to see the white pumpkin up close. She ran towards it and reached out her hand.
"Anna, stop!" Ben shouted. "The witch is coming!"
Anna turned around and saw a woman in a black dress and a pointy hat. She had a broom in one hand and a cat in the other. She looked very angry.
"Who are you and what are you doing in my garden?" the witch said. "This is my white pumpkin and you can't have it. It is for my magic soup. Go away or I will turn you into frogs!"
Anna was scared. She dropped her hand and ran back to Ben. They held each other and hoped the witch would not hurt them.
"Please, don't turn us into frogs," Anna said. "We are sorry. We didn't know it was your pumpkin. We were just curious."
The witch looked at them and saw that they were just children. She felt a little sorry for them. She decided to let them go.
"Very well, I won't turn you into frogs," the witch said. "But you must promise me never to come back to my garden again. And don't tell anyone about my white pumpkin. It is a secret. Do you understand?"
Anna and Ben nodded. They promised to leave the witch alone and keep her secret. They thanked her and ran away as fast as they could. They never wondered about the white pumpkin again.
