Once upon a time, there were two best friends. Their names were Jack and Jill. They were both very strong.
One day, Jack and Jill were playing together in the park. They were having a lot of fun. 
Jack said to Jill, "Let's take a value. I know the perfect place to go!" Jill smiled and said, "Yes, let's take a value!"
So they took a value together. Jack showed Jill a cool tree with many branches. He said, "See, this is a strong tree. Let's climb it!"
Jill said, "Yes! That sounds like fun!" So they both climbed the strong tree. 
They had a great time and felt even stronger afterwards. The value they took together made them closer than ever.
