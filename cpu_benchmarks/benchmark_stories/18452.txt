Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. She loved to ride the subway with her mom. One day, something strange happened on the subway. Lily saw a man with a sour face. She asked her mom why he looked so unhappy. Her mom explained that sometimes people have bad days and feel grumpy. Lily felt sad for the man and wanted to make him feel better. She offered him a cookie and he smiled. From that day on, Lily always brought extra cookies on the subway, just in case someone needed a little bit of happiness.
