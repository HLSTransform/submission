Once upon a time, there was a nice little puppy. He was always so happy, playing with his friends and wagging his tail. One day, the puppy's best friend got very sick. The puppy felt so sad and didn't know what to do. He started to weep. He wept and wept until his mommy saw him. His mommy told him it was going to be ok and hugged him tight. She took him to see his friend the next day, and the puppy's friend was all better. The puppy was so happy he started to run and jump around, barking and playing with his friend again. They were best friends forever and always had nice days together. The end.
