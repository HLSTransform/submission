Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily went on a walk with her mommy. They saw lots of flowers, but Lily liked the lilies the most. She picked one and smelled it, but it was smelly! 
"Lily, we can't keep that flower. It's not nice to pick flowers from someone else's garden," said mommy. 
Lily was sad, but she understood. "Can we pack a picnic instead?" she asked. 
"Sure, let's go home and pack some sandwiches," mommy replied. And so, they went home and packed a yummy picnic. They sat outside and enjoyed their lunch while looking at the pretty flowers in their own garden. Lily was happy again. The end.
