Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally loved playing in her garden. One day, when Sally was playing, she noticed a glass jar with a mint inside. She felt an urge to open it. 
When she opened the jar, a big, mean-looking monster appeared. The monster said, "Give me your house or else!"
Sally felt so helpless. She tried to run away, but the monster was too fast. He grabbed Sally and took her away. 
Sally never saw her home again. The end.
