Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Lily. She loved to visit her grandma's house. Her grandma lived in a small house with a big garden. Lily liked to play in the garden with her dog, Spot.
One day, Lily and Spot found a little bird in the garden. The bird could not fly. Lily wanted to help the bird. She kneeled down and picked up the bird very gently. Spot wagged his tail and watched.
Lily took the bird to her grandma. Her grandma was kind too. They took care of the bird until it could fly again. The bird was happy and so were Lily and Spot. They loved helping their new friend.
