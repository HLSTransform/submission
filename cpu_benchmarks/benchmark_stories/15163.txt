One day, Bob and his dad were walking down a path together. 
"Dad," said Bob, "what is that?"
Bob was pointing to a big truck that was parked close to a stream. 
"That is a dump truck, Bob," his dad explained. "It carries big loads from one place to another."
Bob looked curious. 
"Can we see it, Dad?" he asked.
So his dad helped him climb up into the truck. It was empty, but it was still fun for Bob to explore. He opened the door and looked at all the buttons on the dashboard. 
At the same time, a gloomy sky began to form. 
"It looks like rain," said his dad, so they climbed down from the truck and started running back home. 
As they ran, Bob asked his dad, "When will the truck load another load?" 
"Soon, I expect," his dad replied. 
Just then, they heard the rain and laughed as they ran faster!
