Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sunshine. One day, she saw a pretty daisy in the grass. She picked it up and held it in her hand.
Suddenly, Lily heard her mommy calling her name. She knew she had to rush back home. She was worried that she might be late for lunch. So, she put the daisy in her pocket and ran as fast as she could.
When she got home, her mommy was waiting for her with a big smile on her face. She hugged Lily and said, "Don't be worried, my dear. You're right on time for lunch!" Lily smiled and took the daisy out of her pocket. She gave it to her mommy as a present. Her mommy was very happy and gave her a big kiss on the cheek.
