Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a cat named Mittens. Mittens was a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes. Lily loved her cat very much.
One day, Lily and Mittens went to the store to buy some cat food. They saw a toy that Lily really wanted, but it was too expensive. Lily said to Mittens, "I wish I could have that toy, but it's too expensive."
Mittens meowed and then suddenly, something changed. The store owner came over and said, "I have a surprise for you, Lily. The toy is now on sale and it's not expensive anymore." Lily was so happy and hugged Mittens, "Thank you for changing my luck, Mittens!"
