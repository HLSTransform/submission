Lily likes to run in the park with her dog Spot. Spot is a big dog with black and white fur. He likes to chase balls and birds and Lily. One day, Lily and Spot run to the big tree. Lily sees a hole in the tree. She wants to look inside.
Lily puts her hand in the hole. She feels something hard and sharp. It hurts her hand. She pulls her hand out. She sees a nail in the hole. The nail is dry and rusty. Lily cries. Spot barks. He wants to help Lily.
Lily's mom hears Lily and Spot. She runs to the big tree. She sees Lily's hand. She sees the nail. She hugs Lily and says, "Don't worry, my sweet. I will make it better." She takes Lily and Spot to the car. She drives to the doctor. The doctor cleans Lily's hand and puts a band-aid on it. He gives Lily a sticker and a lollipop. He says, "You are very brave, Lily. The nail can't hurt you anymore."
Lily smiles. She says, "Thank you, doctor. Thank you, mom. Thank you, Spot." She hugs them all. She feels better. She still likes to run in the park with her dog Spot. But she doesn't put her hand in the hole anymore. She knows the nail is there. She knows it is dry and sharp. She knows it is not a toy.
