Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to wear a blue skirt. She wore it every day and never wanted to take it off. One day, she spilled juice on her skirt and it got all wet. She didn't know what to do, so she just kept wearing it.
But then her mom told her to take off the skirt and soak it in some water. The little girl didn't want to take off her favorite skirt, but she listened to her mom and soaked it in water. After a little while, the skirt was all clean and dry again.
The little girl learned that sometimes we have to take care of our things and make sure they are clean and nice. She also learned that it's okay to take off her favorite skirt for a little while to make it look nice again. From that day on, she took better care of her things and always made sure her blue skirt was clean and pretty.
