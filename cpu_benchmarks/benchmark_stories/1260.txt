Once upon a time there was a vehicle. It was gentle and kind. It drove around the town looking for things to supply. Everywhere the vehicle went people were happy to see it. 
The vehicle went to stores, bakeries and parks. Everywhere it went it supplied things that were needed. 
People cheered when it came to the bakery and brought delicious treats. At the park, it supplied happy smiles and laughter. Other places it supplied books and crayons. 
Everyone wanted the vehicle to come back again and again. They knew it would supply kindness and things that made them happy. 
The gentle vehicle kept on making its rounds, bringing joy and happiness along the way.
