Once there was a little girl named Grace. She was so excited because it was the evening and she was going to study.
Grace skipped out of her bedroom, ready to start her evening of studying. But when she opened her bedroom door, she saw that the living room was a mess.
Grace felt very ashamed. She had wanted to impress her parents when they came home, so they would be proud.
Her mother saw her standing there. "What's wrong, sweetheart?" she asked gently.
Grace told her mother what had happened. "I was going to study, but then I saw the mess in the living room," she said.
Her mother hugged her tight and said, "Sometimes things don't work out the way we plan, and that's okay. Let's clean this mess up together and then you can start studying."
So Grace and her mother worked together to clean the living room. When they finished, Grace thanked her mother for her help and ran to her bedroom to start her evening of studying.
