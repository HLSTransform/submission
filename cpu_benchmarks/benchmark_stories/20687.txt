Bobby was a 3 year old boy who loved to play outside. He would spend hours exploring and discovering new things. One day he went outside and saw a broken play set in his neighbor's yard. He was sad to see it was broken, and wanted to help.
He ran to his Mommy and Daddy and asked them if he could fix it. They said he should try. So Bobby set to work serving the play set. He spent all day tightening screws and putting things back together.
Finally his work was done and the play set was as good as new. Bobby was so proud of himself. His Mommy and Daddy were so happy that Bobby helped fix the play set. Everyone was very happy.
