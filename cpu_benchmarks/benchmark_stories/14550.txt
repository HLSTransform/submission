Once upon a time there was a girl who was very gifted. One day, the girl was having a really hot day and wanted to stay cool. Then, when the girl arrived home, she was surprised to find her mum had bought her a fan! The girl was so happy and excited she began giving the fan big cuddles. 
The fan was a pretty pink one with a smiley face on. It was just the fan she always wanted. Every day, the girl was so thankful to have her fan with her. Whenever she felt hot, she would use the fan and feel so cool and comfy. 
She even took her fan with her wherever she went. It was the best fan ever! The end.
