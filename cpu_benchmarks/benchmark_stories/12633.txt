Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and explore the forest. One day, Timmy and his friend Billy went on a walk. They followed a path that led them to a river. Timmy and Billy decided to cross the river, so they took off their shoes and socks.
After they crossed the river, they sat down to rest. Suddenly, the sky turned dark and a fierce storm began. Timmy and Billy tried to run back home, but they got lost on the path. They were very wet and cold, and they couldn't find their way back. 
Timmy started to cry and said, "I want to go home, I don't like being wet." But they couldn't find their way back and they were stuck in the forest all night. The next morning, the sun came out and the boys were able to find their way back home, but they were very sick from being wet and cold all night. From then on, Timmy never went on a walk without his parents.
