Once upon a time there was a famous machine. It was very special and people talked about it all the time. Everyone wanted to know what it did, but nobody could figure it out.
Then one day a little girl came to visit the machine. Her name was Daisy and she was only 3 years old. She walked up to the machine and smiled.
“Hi there,” said Daisy. “What’s your name?”
The machine didn’t say anything, but Daisy wasn’t discouraged. She mentioned the machine’s name to everyone she passed. Soon, everyone in the neighbourhood knew the name of the famous machine.
The machine was so happy that it started to work. It did special things that nobody else could do. Everyone was amazed and Daisy was the most excited of all.
She had discovered the secret of the famous machine - all it needed was a friendly friend to mention its name.
