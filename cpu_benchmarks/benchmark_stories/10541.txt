Once upon a time there were two special friends. His name was Jack and her name was Lucy. Jack really liked to borrow things. One day he asked Lucy if he could borrow her hoop. She said yes and gave him the hoop. Jack was gifted and he was always able to do exciting things with things he borrowed. 
He bounced the hoop until it was high in the air. Then he jumped through and did a wonderful flip inside the hoop. Lucy was very impressed. She had never seen him do something like that before. She asked Jack how he learned to do it, and he said it was just something that came natural to him. 
Jack smiled and said, "You should try it. It's fun!" Lucy said she would try, and with a few tries, she was able to do a flip inside the hoop. She was pleased with herself and thanked Jack for lending her the hoop. 
They laughed and high-fived each other, happy to have such a great time together.
