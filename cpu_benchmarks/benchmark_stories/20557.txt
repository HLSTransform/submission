Once upon a time, there was an ordinary girl. She had an ordinary bike with two pedals. One pedal made the bike go fast, and the other pedal made it go slow.
The girl loved to ride her bike so much, but one day it was time to go inside. She was sad that she had to go, so she thought of a way to keep playing. She hopped off the bike and spun around the back wheel. She used her hands to lock the wheel so that the bike wouldnâ€™t move.
The girl was very happy and ran inside. Every day after, she hopped on her bike and locked the wheel so that she could keep playing.
She had so much fun and soon her friends wanted to play too. Everyone got their bikes out of the garage and they each locked their own wheels so they could keep playing. Every day they would lock the wheels and have lots of fun.
The girl was so happy to have found the ordinary way to keep playing her favorite game.
