Once upon a time, there was a big house with lots of rooms. It was a modern house with shiny floors and bright lights. One day, the mom noticed a leak in the kitchen sink. Water was coming out of the pipe and making a big mess. She told her son to push a bucket under the sink to catch the water. The little boy pushed the bucket under the sink and it caught all the water. The mom was happy that her son was so helpful. They called a plumber to fix the leak and soon the kitchen was dry again. The end.
