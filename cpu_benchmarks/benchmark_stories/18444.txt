Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved Sundays because that was the day she got to play outside. She liked to run around and pretend she was a wild animal.
One Sunday, Lily's friend asked her to come over and play. Lily put on her favorite dress and ran to her friend's house. They played together for a while, but then Lily's friend suggested they play a game of tag near the road. Lily was scared, but her friend convinced her it would be fun.
Suddenly, a car came speeding down the road and hit Lily. She was hurt very badly and had to go to the hospital. Lily's parents were very sad and wished they had told her not to play near the road. From then on, Lily couldn't play outside anymore and she missed being wild and free.
