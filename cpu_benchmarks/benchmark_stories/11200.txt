One day, Sally was spinning in her room. She spun around and around and around, so fast that her dress started to spin and her hair twirled around her ears. She spun so quickly and so dizzyingly that she made herself feel like she was flying. 
After a few minutes, Sally stopped spinning and saw a purple, round orange spinning on the floor. She bent down to pick it up, and realized it was a lollipop. She smiled to herself and it crawled up to her mouth, when suddenly, she heard her mom's voice in the living room. 
"Sally!" shouted her mom, "What have you done?"
Sally thought she was in trouble. She had forgotten that she was not allowed to eat sugary treats without asking first! She knew she was going to get scolded for her naughty behavior. 
Just then, her mom walked into the room. She saw the orange lollipop in Sally's hand, shook her head and told Sally to put it away. Sally was so disappointed. She was looking forward to finally tasting something this yummy, but her mom said she had to wait. 
Sally sadly dropped the lollipop on the floor and watched it slowly spin away.
