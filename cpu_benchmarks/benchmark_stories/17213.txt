Once upon a time, there was a lady who loved to swim. She had a green swimsuit that she wore every time she went to the pool. One day, she went to the pool and started to swim. She was having so much fun splashing in the water.
Suddenly, she started to feel tired and couldn't swim anymore. She tried to call for help, but nobody heard her. She sank to the bottom of the pool and didn't come back up. The lifeguard found her too late and she couldn't be saved.
The people at the pool were very sad that the lady had died. They remembered how much she loved to swim and splash in the water. They decided to put up a sign to remind everyone to be careful in the pool.
