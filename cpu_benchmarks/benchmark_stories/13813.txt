Lily and Ben were twins. They liked to play outside in the sun. But today it was raining. They were miserable.
"Mom, can we go out?" Lily asked.
"No, dear. It is wet and cold. You will get sick," Mom said.
"But we are bored. There is nothing to do," Ben said.
Mom thought for a moment. She had an idea.
"Why don't you play with the zip bags? You can make shapes and colors with them," she said.
She gave them a big box of zip bags. They had different sizes and colors. Lily and Ben were curious.
They opened the box and took out some zip bags. They filled them with water and food coloring. They made red, blue, green, and yellow bags. They zipped them shut.
They put them on the floor and made a row. They made a long row, a short row, a zigzag row, and a circle row. They moved them around and made patterns. They had fun.
"Look, Mom. We made a rainbow," Lily said.
"That's beautiful, dear. You are very clever," Mom said.
Lily and Ben smiled. They were not miserable anymore. They liked the zip bags. They played with them until the rain stopped.
