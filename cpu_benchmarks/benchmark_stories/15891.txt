Once upon a time there was a lady who loved watching the opera. She thought it was a regular thing in life to watch the opera and she was never ever bored each time it was on.
One day, she decided to go to the opera with her friend. They both put on their best dresses and happily walked to the theatre. 
"Do you think the show will be good?" asked the lady.
Her friend smiled. "It's always good," she said.
When they got to the theatre, they were amazed by the loud music that was playing. The stage was bright with pretty colours and the opera singers sang so loudly that the lady clapped along with the beats.
At the end of the show, the lady and her friend were so happy. They laughed and clapped until the performers took a bow.
The lady thanked them for such a regular amazing show and waved goodbye to the opera singers as they finished for the night.
