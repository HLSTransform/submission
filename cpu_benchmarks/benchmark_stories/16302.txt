Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars, but one day, his favorite car broke. Timmy was sad and didn't know what to do. 
His mom saw him crying and asked him what was wrong. Timmy showed her his broken car and said, "Car broken, Mommy. Need to repair." 
Mommy knew how much Timmy loved his car, so she promised to help him fix it. They went to the garage and got some tools. Timmy watched as Mommy worked on the car. 
After a while, Mommy said, "All done! Car is fixed!" Timmy was so happy and gave his Mommy a big hug. They celebrated by having a high snack of cookies and milk. Timmy learned that even when things break, they can be repaired and made better again.
