Once upon a time there was a brilliant oyster. He lived in the sea with all his friends who loved to play. One day, the oyster said he wanted to learn something new. His friends laughed and said that maybe he should learn how to swim. 
The oyster, although nervous, said that he could do it. He tried and tried and although it took a long time, eventually he managed to swim! His friends were so surprised and clapped and cheered. 
The oyster was so happy and said: “I am a brilliant swimmer!” 
However, his friends all said that now he had learned how to swim he must try something much harder. All of them said in unison: "You must learn how to fly!" 
The oyster was really scared to try but he was determined to prove that he was brilliant. He took a deep breath and started to flap his wings. After a few tries he lifted off the ground and started to fly! His friends cheered and clapped, they were so proud of the oyster. 
The oyster had learned something new that he never thought he could do. He had proved that he was brilliant. He was so happy and his friends congratulated him. They said, “That was amazing! Now you can fly, there is nothing you can’t do!”
