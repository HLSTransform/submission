Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mary. She loved to explore the nature around her. One day, she decided to go for a walk. She was wearing a warm jacket, but it was cold outside.
Mary saw a tree and she decided to poke it. She looked closely and saw that the bark was rough and bumpy. She kept poking and exploring until she saw a big ant hill with lots of ants running around. She was so excited!
Mary started poking and playing with the ant hill. She watched them very closely, until she heard a noise. It was a cold wind blowing, and Mary knew it was time to go home. As she left, she waved good-bye to the ants and the nature around her.
