Once there was a big box. Inside it was a thoughtful symbol with a big red bow. The symbol was so shiny and beautiful! Everyone was wondering what was inside.
Suddenly, a little girl came and wrapped her arms around the box. She wanted to know what was inside too!
The little girl smiled as she carefully unwrapped the bow. Then, she opened the box and found a special stuffed toy. She was so happy!
The little girl hugged the toy and smiled from ear to ear. She was so grateful for the thoughtful gift.
The little girl never forgot the special symbol in the box and all the joy it brought her.
