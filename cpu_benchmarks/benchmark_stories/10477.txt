Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wanted to be a scientist. She had a dream to explore a volcano. One day she set out on a great adventure.
The little girl was walking in the forest when she noticed something hidden behind a tree. It was a volcano! She was so excited!
She decided to explore the volcano. At first, everything was a big mess. "I'll have to clean up to make this volcano look nice," she said to herself.
So the little girl started to clean. She raked the dirt and picked up rocks. After a lot of hard work, the volcano was spotless!
The little girl was so proud of her work. She decided to take a break. As she was admiring the volcano, she saw something inside. It was a treasure! 
She had discovered a secret, hidden treasure! 
The little girl couldn't believe her luck. She had found the perfect thing to make her volcano dream come true.
