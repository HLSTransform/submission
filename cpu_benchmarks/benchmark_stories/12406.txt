Once upon a time there were two friends, Lucy and Ben. They were both three year olds, and they had a very good time playing together.
One day, Lucy asked Ben: "Do you like potatoes?" 
Ben smiled and said: "Yes, I like potatoes very much. They are so good." 
Then Lucy said: "Let's make some potatoes for our snack. It would seem yummy!" 
Ben nodded in agreement. They ran to their kitchen and started cooking the potatoes. They boiled them and smashed them until they were soft and yummy.
When the potatoes were ready, they both took a big helping and ate them with ketchup and cheese. They smiled and clapped their hands. The potatoes tasted good! 
"This is the best snack ever," said Lucy. 
"Yes," agreed Ben. "Potatoes seem to be the best snack ever!"
