Once upon a time there was a little puppy. He liked to play with all of his toys, especially a blue collar. But one day he accidentally ripped the blue collar and it was all torn up. His mommy saw how sad he was about it, so she said she would help. She took him to the store to get a new collar. She picked out a shiny red one and the little puppy was so excited. His mommy replaced the old blue collar with the shiny red one. The little puppy was so happy to have a new collar. He loved it and wore it everywhere. He was so proud of it and never wanted to take it off. From that day on, he was always smiling with his shiny red collar. And they all lived happily ever after.
