Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to play outside, no matter what the weather was like. She was a competitive girl and liked to race her friends.
One day, it was raining, but Mia still wanted to play outside. She put on her raincoat and boots and went to the park. There, she saw her friend Tom. Tom was also competitive and liked to play in the rain.
Mia said, "Tom, let's race to the big tree!" Tom agreed, and they started to run. They splashed in puddles and got all wet. Mia won the race and they both laughed.
After the race, Mia and Tom were very wet. They decided to go home and soak in a warm bath to get dry. They had so much fun playing outside in the rain, and couldn't wait to do it again.
