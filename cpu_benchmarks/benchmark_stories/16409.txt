Lily and Tom are going on a big plane with Mom and Dad. They are very happy. They want to see new things and play with new friends. Mom and Dad tell them to keep their passports in their bags. Passports are small books with their names and pictures. They need them to go on the plane.
At the airport, they see a lot of people and bags and machines. They follow Mom and Dad to a line. A man in a blue shirt asks for their passports. He looks at them and smiles. He gives them back and says they can go. Lily and Tom are glad. They say thank you and go with Mom and Dad.
But then, they see a big dog. The dog is ugly. It has brown fur and big teeth and a loud bark. It runs to them and sniffs their bags. Lily and Tom are scared. They hold Mom and Dad's hands. The dog finds Tom's bag and pulls it. It wants his passport. Tom cries. He does not want to give his passport to the ugly dog. He tries to keep it.
A lady in a green shirt comes and tells the dog to stop. She says the dog is looking for bad things, not passports. She says sorry to Tom and gives him his bag. She says the dog is nice, but he does not know how to play. She says they can go on the plane now. Lily and Tom are happy. They say thank you and go with Mom and Dad.
They get on the plane and find their seats. They buckle their belts and look out the window. They see the ugly dog and the lady in the green shirt. They wave to them and say bye. They are not scared of the dog anymore. They are excited to see new things and play with new friends. They keep their passports in their bags and wait for the plane to fly.
