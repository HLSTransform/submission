Once there was a rabbit who was hungry. He knew he would have to find food, so he started to look. He saw a carrot and thought it looked tasty. 
He hopped over to the carrot and asked, "Can I have a bite?"
The carrot answered, "Yes, of course you can!" 
The rabbit was so happy and thanked the carrot for being so kind. He took a big bite and was very satisfied. 
But then he realised he had been too eager. He hadn't asked the carrot's owner for permission. The rabbit felt ashamed for not asking and ran away quickly. 
The end!
