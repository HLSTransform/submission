Ben and Lily are twins. They love to play together, but sometimes they fight. Lily is bossy. She likes to tell Ben what to do.
One day, Mom makes steak for dinner. Ben and Lily both love steak. They run to the table and sit down. Mom gives them each a plate with steak, potatoes and peas.
"Yum, yum, steak!" Ben says. He cuts a big piece and puts it in his mouth.
"Ben, you are eating too fast!" Lily says. She is eating slowly and neatly. "You have to chew your food. And you have to eat your peas too. They are good for you."
Ben does not like peas. He does not like Lily telling him what to do. He makes a face at her.
"Lily, you are bossy!" Ben says. He spits out his peas. "You are not my mom. You are not the boss of me. I can eat what I want."
Lily gets angry. She throws her fork at Ben. Ben ducks and the fork hits Mom's glass. The glass breaks and water spills everywhere.
Mom hears the noise and comes to the kitchen. She sees the mess and the twins. She is not happy.
"Ben, Lily, what is going on here?" Mom says. "Why are you fighting? Why did you break my glass? Why are you wasting your food?"
Ben and Lily look at each other. They feel sorry. They know they did something bad.
"Sorry, Mom," Ben says.
"Sorry, Mom," Lily says.
Mom sighs. She loves her twins, but they can be a handful. She cleans up the glass and the water. She gives Ben and Lily a hug.
"I love you, Ben. I love you, Lily. But you have to be nice to each other. And you have to listen to me. And you have to eat your peas. They are good for you."
Ben and Lily nod. They hug Mom back. They say they love her too. They finish their steak and their peas. They promise to be good. They are not bossy anymore. They are happy.
