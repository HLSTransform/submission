Tom and Sue are twins. They like to play dress up. They have a big box of old clothes and hats and shoes. They can be anything they want.
One day, they find a fat coat in the box. It is red and has many buttons and pockets. It also has a big patch on the back. Tom says, "I want to be a fireman. I can wear the fat coat and save people from fires." Sue says, "No, I want to be a pirate. I can wear the fat coat and find treasure and fight with swords." They both pull on the coat and try to take it from each other.
"Stop it!" says Mom. "You are tearing the coat. It was your grandpa's coat. He was a brave soldier. He wore the coat in the war. The patch is where a bullet hit him. He was very lucky. He gave me the coat when I was little. It is very special to me."
Tom and Sue feel sorry. They did not know the coat was so important. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We did not mean to hurt the coat. We were just playing." Mom says, "It's okay. I know you were having fun. But you have to be careful with old things. They have stories and memories. Why don't you share the coat and take turns being firemen and pirates?"
Tom and Sue agree. They hug Mom and say, "We love you, Mom. And we love grandpa's coat. Thank you for letting us play with it." They put the coat back in the box and look for other things to dress up with. They have a lot of fun and learn to respect old things.
