Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small village near a big tower. The tower was very tall and had a lot of windows. Lily loved to watch the lively birds fly around the tower.
One day, Lily went to the tower to explore. She climbed up the stairs and looked out the window. She saw the beautiful view of the village. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise and felt the tower shake. She regretted going up the tower because she was scared.
Just then, a kind man came to help her down the stairs. He told her that the tower was being repaired and it was not safe to be inside. Lily was relieved and thanked the man for helping her. She learned her lesson and promised to always listen to the grown-ups.
