Once upon a time there was a little girl named Abby who was very small and only three years old. She loved the color white and always wished she could see a white unicorn. One day, she decided to go for a walk in the woods near her home.
As she walked, she saw a white unicorn in the distance! She wanted to go closer, but was scared and unsure. Then, the unicorn spoke to her softly, saying “you have the sight to heal my broken heart, I've been alone a long time.”
Abby was surprised and asked the unicorn: “how can I help you?” The unicorn replied: “by seeing me with your heart and not your eyes. Believe that I'm here and that I can be the friend you need.” 
Abby nodded and closed her eyes. Her heart was filled with a warmth that spread through her whole body. She opened her eyes and the unicorn was there. She hugged it and its broken heart healed.
Abby and the white unicorn became best friends. She stayed in the woods with it each and every day, and together they created magical memories.
