Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emma. She loved to go outside and play. One day, Emma was walking along the path when she saw a butterfly. She wanted to say hello, so she waved to it gently. The butterfly fluttered away and Emma smiled.
Next, Emma found a big tree in the woods. She decided to climb up the tree and have a nap. She was so tired that she fell asleep right away. She dreamed of the butterfly and many other fun things.
When Emma woke up she was refreshed. She got down from the tree carefully so she wouldn't fall. Then she went back home to have dinner. 
Emma was so happy that she had taken a nap in the tree. She had a great day and learned to be careful.
