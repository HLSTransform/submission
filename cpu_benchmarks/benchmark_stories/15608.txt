Lily and Ben were playing in the living room. They liked to pretend they were spies and had guns made of toys. They would shoot at each other and hide behind the couch and the table.
"Bang, bang, I got you, Lily!" Ben shouted.
"No, you didn't, I dodged your bullet!" Lily said.
They laughed and ran around the room. They saw an ashtray on the coffee table. It was round and shiny and had some gray stuff inside. They didn't know what it was for, but they thought it looked cool.
"Hey, look, a spy gadget!" Ben said. He picked up the ashtray and pretended it was a camera. He pointed it at Lily and said, "Smile, Lily, I'm taking your picture!"
Lily smiled and made a funny face. She thought Ben was silly. She grabbed a pillow and threw it at him. "Take that, Ben, I'm throwing a bomb at you!"
The pillow hit the ashtray and knocked it off the table. It fell on the floor and broke into pieces. The gray stuff spilled out and made a mess.
"Oh no, we broke it!" Lily said. She felt scared and sorry. She knew it was not their toy and they should not have touched it.
Ben felt scared and sorry too. He saw his mom coming into the room. She looked angry and troubled. She saw the broken ashtray and the gray stuff on the floor. She saw Lily and Ben with their toy guns.
"What have you done?" she asked. She sounded very mad. She took the toy guns from them and threw them in the trash. She told them to go to their room and think about what they did. She said they were very naughty and she was very disappointed.
Lily and Ben felt very bad. They went to their room and cried. They wished they had not played with the ashtray. They wished they had not broken it. They wished they had not made their mom mad. They said they were sorry and they loved her. They hoped she would forgive them. They learned their lesson and never played with the ashtray again.
