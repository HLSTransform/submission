Once upon a time, there were two friends named Susie and Rose. Susie was feeling jealous of Rose because Rose kept talking about all the fun things she could do, like jog every morning. One day, Susie wanted to go jogging with Rose, so she sent her a message asking if she could join her. Rose was so excited that Susie wanted to be her jogging buddy, and she sent back a message saying yes. So the next morning, Susie and Rose went jogging together. They had so much fun that they decided to jog together every morning. Susie was no longer jealous of Rose - she was just happy to have a jogging buddy. The end.
