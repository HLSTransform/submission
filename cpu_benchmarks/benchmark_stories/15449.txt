Little Tommy was being very impatient. He had been told it was time to wipe the net. So he took a cloth from the cupboard and started wiping. His mum watched him carefully and encouraged him. Tommy wiped as hard as he could, but it was hard work. He looked up and saw a smile on his mum's face. He kept going and soon, the net was all wiped clean. 
Tommy was so proud of himself for doing such a good job. His mum hugged him and said he did great. Little Tommy smiled and was happy to know he had helped out. 
His mum took the net outside and hung it up in the garden. She told Little Tommy she would be back shortly. Little Tommy waited and waited. He was getting impatient again but soon his mum was back with a surprise. She had hung the net in the garden and caught lots of butterflies! Little Tommy was so excited; he couldn't wait to show his friends. The day had been so much fun and he was glad he had helped out by wiping the net.
