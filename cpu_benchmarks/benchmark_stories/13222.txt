Sam was excited. He was going to the store to buy ice cream and toys. His mom gave him money to buy whatever he wanted. 
When Sam entered the store, shelves lined with colorful boxes and toys filled the room. He spotted the ice cream and hurried over. He held out his money, but the store clerk said he didn't have enough.
Sam was sad, but he noticed the bookshelf nearby. He looked up at his mom, who nodded and gave him more money. Sam paid for his new book and the store clerk gave him some change. 
Sam was excited as he skimmed through the pages of the book. But when he saw a giant robot on the cover he jumped with joy and smiled. Suddenly, he noticed a figure in the corner of the page. He read the word 'yield' and knew what to do. He gathered his change and handed it to the store clerk, who handed him the robot toy.
Sam ran all the way home. His mom was surprised to see him so excited with a robot toy. She laughed and gave him a hug. Sam was grateful to have something to remember this day.
