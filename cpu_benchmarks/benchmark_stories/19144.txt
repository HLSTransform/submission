One day, a cat and a dog were in a distant land. They both wanted to find some news. They walked and walked until they saw a big tree. The cat rubbed the tree and said, "I hope we find news soon."
The dog looked at the cat and said, "Yes, I want to find news too." They walked more and found a big box. The cat rubbed the box and said, "Maybe this box has news inside."
The dog opened the box and found a big bear inside. The bear was angry and chased the cat and the dog. They ran and ran but the bear caught them. The cat and the dog did not find any news and they were very sad.
