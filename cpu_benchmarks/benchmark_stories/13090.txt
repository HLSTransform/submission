One day, a sailor was out at sea. The water was blue and the sky was bright. The sailor was sailing in his boat, smiling in the sunshine.Suddenly, there was a nosy bird. The bird flew overhead, looking around. The sailor smiled and nodded at the bird.
The sailor kept sailing and soon came to shore. It was a beautiful beach, filled with colorful shells. The sailor walked around, looking at everything. But then he noticed something strange. A nosy crab was walking around, looking at everything too.
The sailor nodded at the crab. Then he noticed something even more strange. It was a nosy little girl, peeking out from behind a rock. The sailor smiled and waved at the girl. She smiled back and waved goodbye.
The sailor sailed away, waving goodbye to the nosy girl and the nosy crab. He smiled, feeling happy and content. The nosy bird flew above, watching him sail away.
