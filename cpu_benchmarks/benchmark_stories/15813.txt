Once there was a patient boy. He was very tough. He always woke up early and jumped out of bed.
Today he was very excited because he was going to the forest to see some new animals. He grabbed his hat and jumped out the door.
As he walked into the woods, he heard a strange noise. He looked around and saw a funny looking dog. The dog barked and he knew it was a friendly dog.
He got close to the dog and said "Hello! What is your name?". 
The dog replied, "My name is Woofy. Do you want to be my friend?". 
The boy smiled and said, "Sure! I'll be your friend". Then the boy and Woofy looked around the forest and saw different animals. They saw deer, birds, squirrels and even a rabbit.
The boy was so excited and happy to see all the animals. He smiled and said, "Look at all the animals! They are so cute!". 
Woofy was happy too and he smiled. The boy and Woofy played in the forest all day and had lots of fun. They were the best of friends and even tough days were fun when they were together.
