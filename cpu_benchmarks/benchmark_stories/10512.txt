Once there was a young boy named Max. He was always curious about the world, and one day he asked his mom what the gem she wore around her neck was. She told him it was a special gem with magical powers.
Max loved examining the gem, but he noticed that it was starting to lose its shine. He knew his mom was worried about this, but he didn't know why. He asked her, and she said that if it wasn't kept dry, it would start to change.
Max was determined to keep it dry. He also wanted to find a way to make it even more special. So he started to make a special spicy juice. He knew that if he could make the spicy juice special enough, it would restore the shine back in the gem.
Max worked hard, and after a few weeks, he was finally able to make the special spicy juice. He put some of it on the gem, and sure enough, it started to shine. His mom was very proud of him, and thanked Max for restoring the shine to her gem.
