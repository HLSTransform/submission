Once upon a time, there was a big zoo in the town. Everyone in the town was worried because lots of animals had gone missing.
The people decided to work together to find the noisy animals. They searched everywhere, but the animals were no where to be found.
Soon, the people heard a noise. They followed the loud sound and they saw a group of lost animals in a meadow. They were tired and sleepy, so they could not move anymore.
The people were very glad that they had found the animals and they put them in the zoo. The animals had a nice place to rest.
The animals were happy to be back in the zoo, and the people were not worried any more. Everyone was happy, and had a good rest. The End!
