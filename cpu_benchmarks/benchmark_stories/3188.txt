Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing in her room with her toys. One day, she found a big cushion and she was so excited! She jumped on it and rolled around.
Her mom came in and asked, "What are you doing, Lily?"
"I'm playing on my cushion! Imagine if I could bounce on it like a trampoline!" Lily said with a big smile.
Her mom laughed and said, "That would be so much fun! Maybe we can find a real trampoline for you to play on outside."
Lily was even more excited at the thought of playing on a trampoline. She hugged her mom and said, "Thank you, mom! You always know how to make me happy."
