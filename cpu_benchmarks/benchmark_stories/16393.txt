Lily and Tom were very happy to go to the beach with their mom and dad. They wanted to play in the sand, swim in the water, and see the fish. They packed their toys, towels, and sunscreen in a big bag.
When they got to the beach, they saw a lot of trash on the sand. There were bottles, cans, wrappers, and plastic bags. Lily and Tom felt sad and angry. They asked their mom and dad, "Who made this mess? Why did they not clean it up?"
Mom and dad said, "Some people are not careful with their trash. They leave it on the beach and it hurts the animals and the plants. It is very bad for the beach and the water. We should always throw our trash in the bin or take it home with us. That will prevent more trash from coming to the beach."
Lily and Tom nodded. They decided to help the beach. They put on their gloves and picked up the trash. They put it in a big bag and took it to the bin. They also found some shells and stones that they liked. They put them in a small bag to keep.
After they cleaned the beach, they played in the sand, swam in the water, and saw the fish. They had a lot of fun and felt proud. They said to their mom and dad, "We love the beach. We want to keep it clean and beautiful. We do not want to see any more trash. It is terrible for the beach and the water."
Mom and dad smiled and hugged them. They said, "We are very proud of you, Lily and Tom. You did a great job. You are very kind and responsible. You are good friends to the beach and the water. We love you very much."
