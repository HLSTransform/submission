Sam and Lily were playing on the beach. They liked to dig in the sand and look for shells. They saw a big hole in the sand near the water. They wondered what was inside.
"Maybe it is a treasure!" Sam said.
"Or a monster!" Lily said.
They decided to find out. They took their shovels and started to dig. They dug and dug until they saw something shiny and hard. It was a crab!
The crab was not happy. It had been sleeping in its hole. Sam and Lily had disturbed it. It snapped its claws and made a loud noise.
"Ouch!" Sam said. He dropped his shovel and ran away.
"Sorry, crab!" Lily said. She was thoughtful. She knew the crab was scared and angry. She did not want to hurt it. She put some sand back in the hole and left a shell for the crab.
"Bye, crab!" she said. "Have a nice nap!"
She ran after Sam. They found another spot to play. They did not disturb any more crabs. They had fun on the beach.
