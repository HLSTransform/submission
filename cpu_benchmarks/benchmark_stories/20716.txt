Once there was a young girl named Zoe. Zoe lived in a distant house with her family. She loved to play in her backyard.
One day, Zoe noticed something hanging from a tree in her yard. She went closer to have a better look. It was a leaking bucket! Zoe thought the leaking bucket could make a big splash and so she decided to hang it from a nearby branch.
Once Zoe hung the bucket, she stepped back to see what it would do. Slowly, the water began to flow from the bucket and a small puddle started to form. Zoe was so excited!
She ran inside to tell her family about the leaking bucket, and when her family came outside to see it, they were so amazed. They watched the water drip in the puddle and it was beautiful. Zoe and her family spent the day playing in the distant backyard, always looking back to watch the leaking bucket.
