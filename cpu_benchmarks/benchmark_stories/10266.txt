Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to cook with her mommy in the kitchen. One day, they decided to make pancakes. Lily helped her mommy mix the batter and pour it on the pan. They watched as the pancakes cooked and flipped them over with a spatula.
Suddenly, Lily saw a mysterious bottle on the counter. She asked her mommy what it was. Her mommy said it was syrup and showed her how to squeeze it onto the pancakes. Lily was so excited to try it. She squeezed the syrup all over her pancake and took a big bite. It was delicious!
From that day on, Lily loved making pancakes with her mommy and squeezing syrup on top. She thought it was the best breakfast ever!
