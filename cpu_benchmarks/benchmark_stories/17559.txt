Ben and Lily were playing with their toy cars in the garden. They liked to zoom them on the grass and make loud noises. They saw a big tree with a nest on a branch. They wanted to see what was inside the nest.
"Let's climb the tree and look at the nest," Ben said.
"OK, but be careful," Lily said. She was anxious. She did not like heights.
They put their toy cars down and started to climb the tree. They held on to the trunk and the branches. They got closer and closer to the nest. They saw some feathers and some eggs.
"Wow, look at the eggs!" Ben said. "They are blue and speckled. I wonder what kind of birds they are."
"Shh, don't be loud. You might scare the birds," Lily said.
But it was too late. A big black crow flew out of the nest and cawed angrily. It saw Ben and Lily and thought they were trying to steal its eggs. It flapped its wings and pecked at them with its sharp beak.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Ben and Lily cried. They let go of the branch and fell to the ground. They hurt their arms and legs and heads. They dropped their toy cars and they broke.
The crow flew back to the nest and guarded its eggs. It was happy. Ben and Lily were sad and sore. They ran to their house and told their mom what happened. She hugged them and put bandages on their wounds. She said they should not climb trees and touch nests. They learned their lesson. They did not play with their toy cars again.
