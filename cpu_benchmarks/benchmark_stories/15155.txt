Once upon a time, a nosy fireman lived in a big city. Jake the fireman was always looking out of his window and peeking around, wanting to know what was happening.
One day, he noticed a little girl across the street. He saw her grab a bright red balloon, and take it home. 
Jake thought it was weird and he wanted to know more. So, he ran across the street to talk to her. He asked her, "Where did you get the balloon?"
The little girl looked up and said, "A kind man gave it to me." She showed him all the other balloons the man gave to the other kids.
Jake smiled and said, "That was very nice of him."
The moral of the story is that it is always nice to be kind and help those who need it. Being nosy can make us miss out on seeing the good in people.
