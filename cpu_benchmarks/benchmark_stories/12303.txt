Susie was happy. She went to the cold field with her mom. The sun was shining, the wind was whispers around them.
"What are we going to do here mom?" asked Susie.
"We are going to use this field. We will pick some flowers," her mom said.
Susie looked around and saw that there were no flowers in the field. "Where are the flowers mom?"
"The flowers might not bloom yet, it's still too cold. We just have to wait," said her mom.
Susie was disappointed. She wanted to find some flowers now. But she saw her mom was sad too.
Susie had an idea. She gave her mom a hug and said, "Let's pick some grass. We can use it for something later."
Her mom smiled and said, "That's a great idea! We can make a little basket out of it."
So the two of them picked the grass. They made their basket and took it home. It was a happy ending for both of them.
