Once upon a time, there was a young girl called Abigail. She was very curious and loved to explore the world around her.
One day, she went to the park and saw a tall tree with lots of big, green leaves. She wondered what it would be like to climb up it.
She stretched up to touch the first branch but she couldn't quite reach it. Then she had an idea. She looked around and saw an arrow laying nearby.
"What a good idea!" she said as she picked it up. She held the arrow between the branch and herself and pushed. It was flexible, just like she had hoped.
She gave it a few more tries and then she was able to pull the branch down low enough to climb! Abigail was so excited at her success and she was ready to explore the rest of the tree.
