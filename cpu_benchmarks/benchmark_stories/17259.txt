Once upon a time, there was a big castle. The castle was very dry because there was no rain. The king of the castle was very sad. He wanted to have a big party but he had no water to serve to his guests.
One day, a little girl came to the castle. She saw the king was sad and asked him why. The king told her about the dry castle and the party he wanted to have. The little girl had an idea. She knew where to find water.
She went to a nearby lake and brought back lots of water. The king was so happy and thanked the little girl. He served the water to his guests and they had a great time. From that day on, the king and the little girl became good friends and always had fun together.
