Once upon a time there was a little girl called Margaret who liked to explore. One day Margaret was exploring in her garden when she saw something funny – a big number sitting in the grass! Margaret went over to pick it up and noticed it smelt yummy like a treat. She quickly popped it in her mouth to find out what it tasted like. 
Unfortunately, it wasn’t yummy at all; it was poison! Margaret started to feel really sick and her face went all red. She ran to find her mum who quickly took her to the doctor’s. The doctor told Margaret not to ever eat mysterious numbers again.
After a few days, Margaret learned her lesson and never ate a strange number again. She always made sure to ask a grown-up first before putting something yummy in her mouth!
