Timmy was afraid. He didn't like the dark. He felt like he was peeking into something that he wasn't supposed to see. He curled up in the corner and tried not to look.
Just then, Timmy's mom came in. She had seen his face and she knew he was scared.
"What's wrong, my little one?" she asked.
Timmy trembled. "I'm...I'm afraid."
His mom hugged him and said, "You don't have to be afraid. I'm here to keep you safe."
She turned on the light, and Timmy felt better.
"Let's take a peek around," she said.
Timmy smiled and they went to explore the room. His mom held his hand, and he felt less fearful.
"It's alright," she said. "I will always be here to protect you."
Timmy nodded. He knew that his mom would keep him safe, no matter what.
