Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy had a blanket that he loved to snuggle with. One day, Timmy felt dizzy and his head was spinning. He tried to speak to his mommy, but his words came out all mixed up. His mommy knew something was wrong and took him to the doctor. The doctor said Timmy just needed to rest and gave him some medicine. Timmy went home and snuggled with his blanket until he felt better.
