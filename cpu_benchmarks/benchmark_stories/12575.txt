Mia and Leo love to dance. They dance in the house, in the park, and in the school. They dance when they are happy, when they are sad, and when they are bored. They dance with their feet, their hands, and their heads.
One day, they see a big road with many cars and buses. They want to dance on the road, but they know it is not safe. They wait for the green light and the white man. Then they cross the road with their mom and dad.
On the other side of the road, they see a rare thing. It is a big truck with many colors and shapes. It has a sign that says "Circus". They hear music and laughter. They see people and animals. They want to see the circus, but they do not have tickets.
They ask their mom and dad if they can go to the circus. Their mom and dad say no, they do not have money for the circus. They say they can watch from outside, but they have to be careful.
Mia and Leo are sad, but they do not cry. They see a clown with a red nose and a big smile. He sees them and waves. He says "Hello, little dancers! Do you want to join me?" He takes out two hats and two canes. He gives them to Mia and Leo. He says "Follow me, I will show you a trick."
He leads them to a small stage near the truck. He says "Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the circus! Today we have a special show for you. We have two amazing dancers who will make you laugh and clap. Please give a big hand to Mia and Leo!"
Mia and Leo are surprised, but they are not scared. They put on the hats and hold the canes. They follow the clown and dance with him. They dance fast and slow, high and low, left and right. They make funny faces and silly noises. They have fun and make everyone happy.
The people in the truck and outside the truck clap and cheer. They say "Bravo, Mia and Leo! You are great dancers!" Mia and Leo smile and bow. They thank the clown and give him back the hats and canes. They hug their mom and dad. They say "We love to dance!" They are happy. They dance all the way home.
