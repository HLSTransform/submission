Once upon a time, there was a bee who lived in a hive. The bee's hive was crisp and smooth, and it was filled with honey. Each day, the bee would bravely fly out of the hive, high up into the clouds. There, the bee would buzz around and find sweet, yummy pollen to collect. 
Back at the hive, the bee would carefully unload the pollen into the honeycomb. Then, the bee would use its wings to flutter around and make a honey so smooth and delicious. Every day, the bee would yield more and more honey until the hive was filled with it. 
The bee was so proud of all its hard work. It had made the hive so sweet and full of yummy honey. So with a happy buzz, the bee would fly off to find more pollen and make more delicious honey. And everyone, of course, was extremely happy with that.
