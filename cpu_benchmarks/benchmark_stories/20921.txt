Once upon a time, there was a weak elephant. He was so weak he could hardly balance. He tried to stand on one leg, but he couldn't do it. He tried to stand on two legs, but he wobbled and fell over.
The elephant was sad, so he decided to find someone to help him. He looked around until he spotted a small boy. He could tell the boy was very clever.
The elephant asked the boy for help. The boy smiled and thought of an idea. He told the elephant to concentrate and find his balance. The elephant closed his eyes and tried again.
Amazingly, after a few tries, the elephant managed to balance on one leg. Then he balanced on two legs. He felt strong and happy!
The little boy was so proud of the elephant and cheered with joy. From then on, the elephant and the little boy were best friends as they practiced balancing together.
