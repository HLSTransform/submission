Once upon a time, there were two birds; a bald eagle and a sparrow. The bald eagle said to the sparrow, “Let’s fly together!” 
The sparrow was scared, so he said, “But I’m not strong enough to fly so high. I can only fly a short distance.”
The bald eagle smiled and said, “It’s okay, I can help you. Just stick close to me and I will help you fly higher.” So the sparrow followed the bald eagle as they soared in the sky.
Suddenly, the sky became cold. The bald eagle was about to fall because he was getting tired, but the sparrow came to help him. The sparrow said, “Let's stick together, then we can make it through the cold air easier.”   
So they did, and they both managed to fly past the cold air safely. 
At the end of their journey, the bald eagle said, “We made it! But I wouldn’t have been able to make it without you.”
The moral of the story is that it is better to help each other and stick together, instead of trying to do things on our own.
