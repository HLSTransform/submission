Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to swing and slide and run. Lily had a big red balloon. She tied it to her wrist with a string. She did not want to lose it.
"Look, Ben, my balloon is so high!" Lily said. She pointed to the sky. "It can touch the moon!"
Ben laughed. He did not think Lily was right. "No, Lily, your balloon is not that high. The moon is very far away. You are silly!"
Lily felt sad. She did not like Ben's words. She thought he was mean. She wanted to show him that her balloon was high. She let go of the string. She hoped her balloon would fly to the moon.
But the balloon did not fly to the moon. It flew away with the wind. Lily watched it go. She felt sorry. She wished she had not let go of the string. She wanted her balloon back.
"Ha ha, Lily, you are stupid!" Ben said. He pointed to the balloon. "You lost your balloon! Now you have nothing!"
Lily cried. She did not like Ben. She did not want to play with him. She ran to her mom. She hugged her mom. She told her what happened.
Her mom was kind. She wiped Lily's tears. She gave her a kiss. She said, "Don't worry, Lily. You are not silly or stupid. You are smart and brave. You tried something new. Sometimes we make mistakes. That's how we learn. And you still have me. I love you."
Lily smiled. She felt better. She loved her mom. She said, "Thank you, mom. I love you too. Can we get another balloon?"
Her mom nodded. She said, "Yes, we can. But this time, let's keep it tied to your wrist. OK?"
Lily agreed. She said, "OK, mom. Let's go get another balloon. A blue one. Like the sky. And the moon."
