Once upon a time, there was a girl named Susie. She was three years old and she always loved to play with her friends. One day, her friends were playing arrow tag and Susie wanted to join in. However, her friends all had bows and Susie had none.
Susie felt very envious, so she walked up to one of her friends and asked if she could borrow his bow. He said yes, and when Susie held the bow in her little hands, she knew she had found something special. 
Susie took the bow and held it in her two hands like she had seen on TV. With one hand, she pulled back the string and with her other, she reached for an arrow. She aimed the bow at the sky and let go. 
The arrow raced through the air and Susie gasped in delight. Her friends were all amazed by how far she had shot, and they all congratulated her. Susie was so happy and she held her bow close to her body as she said goodbye to her friends. 
This was the best day ever, and from then on, Susie could always be found with her bow in her hands, dreaming of shooting arrows into the sky.
