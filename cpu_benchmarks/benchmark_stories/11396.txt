Once upon a time there was an animal called Joe. Joe wanted to succeed in life. He tried and tried but he didn't seem to make any progress. One day he had an original idea. He decided to save up each day and invest in something. He worked hard to save his money and eventually he succeeded.
One day Joe was walking and he saw another animal. Joe walked up to her and said, "Hi, I'm Joe. I wanted to show you something. I have succeeded in saving money and investing in something special. Would you like to see it?"
The other animal said, "Sure". Joe showed her the original item he had bought. Her eyes lit up in excitement. She said, "That is so great. You must have worked really hard to achieve this". 
From that day on Joe and the other animal became very good friends. They celebrated Joe's success and always cheered each other on to succeed.
