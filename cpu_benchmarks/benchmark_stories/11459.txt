Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mary. Mary was three years old. Every day, Mary went to her mailbox and waited for the mailman to arrive. 
She was always so excited for the mail because she loved getting letters. One day, however, the mailman brought something really strange. It was a box with a big smiley face on it. 
Mary was very confused and opened the box. Inside the box was a soft toy. It was brown, and had big eyes and a friendly smile. Mary picked it up and hugged it.
"You look very sad," Mary said to the toy. "Why do you suffer?"
The toy was silent for a moment, then it said, "I don't know why I'm suffering. I'm confused, just like you." Mary hugged the toy even tighter and smiled at it. From then on, she never felt alone.
