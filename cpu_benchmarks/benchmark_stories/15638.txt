Lily and Ben like to play basketball. They have a big ball and a hoop in the yard. They take turns to throw the ball in the hoop. Sometimes they miss, but they keep trying.
One day, a new boy comes to the yard. His name is Sam. He wants to play basketball too. He asks Lily and Ben if he can join them. They say yes, and they give him the ball.
Sam tries to throw the ball in the hoop, but he is too small. The ball is too heavy for him, and the hoop is too high. He feels sad. He thinks he is not good at basketball.
Lily and Ben see that Sam is sad. They want to be helpful. They have an idea. They act like they are coaches. They tell Sam to stand closer to the hoop. They tell him to hold the ball with both hands. They tell him to look at the hoop and push the ball up.
Sam listens to Lily and Ben. He does what they say. He stands closer to the hoop. He holds the ball with both hands. He looks at the hoop and pushes the ball up. The ball goes in the hoop. Sam is happy. He smiles and cheers.
Lily and Ben are happy too. They clap and cheer for Sam. They say, "Good job, Sam! You did it!" They give him a high five. They tell him he is good at basketball. They ask him if he wants to play more. He says yes, and they play more. They have fun. They are friends.
