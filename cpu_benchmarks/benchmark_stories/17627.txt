Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and feel the soft ground under her feet. One day, she was playing with her toys when she accidentally stepped on a sharp rock. It hurt her foot and made her uncomfortable.
Lily's mom saw her crying and asked what happened. Lily showed her the rock in her foot. Her mom gently removed the rock and cleaned the wound. Lily felt much better and was able to play outside again.
From then on, Lily made sure to watch where she was walking so she wouldn't step on any more rocks. She loved feeling the ground under her feet, but she didn't want to be uncomfortable again.
