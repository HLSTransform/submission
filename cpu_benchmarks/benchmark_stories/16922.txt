Sara is a girl who likes to play with her cat, Tom. Tom is a black cat with a long tail. Sara likes to pull his tail and make him meow. Tom does not like that. He runs away from Sara and hides under the bed.
One day, Sara finds a toy mouse that makes a squeak sound when she squeezes it. She thinks it is funny and she wants to show it to Tom. She goes to the bedroom and looks for Tom. She sees his tail sticking out from under the bed. She grabs his tail and pulls it hard. Tom jumps out and hisses at Sara. He is angry and scared.
"Tom, look what I have!" Sara says. She squeezes the toy mouse and it squeaks. Tom does not like the noise. He thinks it is a real mouse that wants to eat him. He runs away from Sara and the toy mouse. He looks for a safe place to hide.
Sara follows Tom and tries to make him play with her. She repeats the same thing. She pulls his tail and squeezes the toy mouse. Tom repeats the same thing. He jumps out and hisses at Sara. He runs away from Sara and the toy mouse. He looks for a safe place to hide.
They go around the house like this for a long time. Sara does not understand why Tom does not want to play with her. Tom does not understand why Sara does not leave him alone. They are both unhappy.
Then, Sara's mom comes home. She sees Sara and Tom running and making noise. She sees the toy mouse in Sara's hand. She understands what is going on.
"Sara, stop that!" she says. "You are scaring Tom. He does not like the toy mouse. He thinks it is real. He does not like it when you pull his tail. It hurts him. You have to be gentle and kind to him. He is your friend."
Sara looks at her mom. She looks at Tom. She looks at the toy mouse. She feels sorry. She did not know she was hurting Tom. She did not know he was afraid. She loves Tom. She wants him to be happy.
She drops the toy mouse and lets go of Tom's tail. She says, "I'm sorry, Tom. I did not mean to scare you. I wanted to play with you. Can we be friends?"
Tom looks at Sara. He looks at her mom. He looks at the toy mouse. He feels calm. He knows Sara did not mean to hurt him. He knows she loves him. He wants to be friends.
He walks slowly to Sara and rubs his head against her leg. He purrs softly. He says, "Meow."
Sara smiles and bends down to pet Tom. She says, "I love you, Tom. You are a good cat. Let's play something else."
Tom nods and follows Sara. He says, "Meow."
Sara's mom watches them and smiles. She says, "That's better. Now you are both happy. And remember, don't repeat the same thing that makes Tom unhappy. Find something else that makes him happy."
Sara and Tom agree. They say, "Okay."
They go to the living room and find a ball of yarn. They play with it together. They roll it and chase it and catch it. They have fun. They are happy. They are friends.
