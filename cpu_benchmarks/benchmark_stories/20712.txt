Once upon a time, there was a fierce bus. The bus always wanted to care for the people around it. Every day, the bus would take people to places they wanted to go. The bus was very friendly and kind to everyone.
One day, a little girl walked up to the bus. She was only three years old and she was feeling very scared. But the bus saw her and smiled. It was happy to take care of her and make her feel safe.
So the bus opened its doors and the little girl climbed on. Then, the bus drove her to a place that was very special. When they arrived, the little girl saw that all of her family was there to care for her. She felt so happy and she smiled and hugged the bus goodbye.
From then on, every time she saw that fierce bus, she would remember how it had taken care of her and taken her to her special place.
