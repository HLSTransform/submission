Once upon a time, there was a jolly little girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mommy went to a hotel for vacation. Lily was so excited to explore the hotel! She saw a big elevator and asked her mommy if they could go up. 
Her mommy said, "Sure, let's push the button!" They went up to the top floor and saw a beautiful view. Lily said, "Wow, this is amazing!" 
Later that day, Lily and her mommy went to the pool. Lily saw a boy playing with a ball and she wanted to play too. She asked the boy, "Can I play with you?" The boy said, "Yes, let's push the ball back and forth!" They had so much fun playing together. 
At the end of the day, Lily was tired but happy. She said to her mommy, "Thank you for taking me to the hotel. I had a great day!"
