Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a kind and honest girl named Lily. She loved to bake cakes for her friends and family. One day, she made a big, yummy cake for her best friend's birthday.
Lily carefully put the cake in the oven to bake. She waited and waited until it was ready. When the cake was done, she had to remove it from the oven. She used big, thick gloves to take the hot cake out. Then, she let the cake cool down.
After the cake cooled, Lily decorated it with sweet frosting and colorful sprinkles. She was excited to give the cake to her best friend. At the birthday party, everyone loved the cake and thanked Lily for her hard work. Lily felt happy and proud to be an honest friend who shared her yummy cake.
