Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and make pretty clothes for them. One day, she saw her mommy making a cake and asked if she could help.
Mommy said, "Sure, you can help me feed the ingredients into the mixer." Lily was very excited to help and she put in the flour, eggs, and sugar.
After they finished baking the cake, Lily wanted to make a special dress for her doll. She took a piece of paper and started to model the dress with her little hands. Mommy was impressed by her creative skills and said, "Wow, you are so talented!"
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, mommy. I will feed my doll some cake and then show her the dress I made." Mommy smiled back and said, "That sounds like a great plan!" And they all lived happily ever after.
