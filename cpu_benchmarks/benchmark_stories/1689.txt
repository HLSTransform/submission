Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She wanted to bake cookies in the oven. She asked her mom if they could bake cookies together. Her mom said they could, but the oven was broken. Lily felt sad because she really wanted to bake cookies.
Lily's mom tried to fix the oven, but she couldn't. Lily's dad suggested they buy a new oven. They went to the store and found a comfortable oven that they all liked. But when they got home, they realized the oven was too big for their kitchen. They had a problem!
Lily's mom and dad talked about what they could do. Lily listened and had an idea. She said, "I want to bake cookies, but the oven is too big. Can we put it in the garage?" Her mom and dad thought it was a great idea. They moved the oven to the garage and Lily was finally able to bake her cookies. They were so delicious and everyone was happy!
