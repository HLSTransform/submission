Ben and Lily were playing with their toy cars in the living room. They liked to make them zoom and crash and honk. Sometimes they pretended to be drivers and talked to each other.
"Beep beep, I'm a taxi!" said Ben, holding a yellow car. "Where do you want to go, Lily?"
"I want to go to the park and see the ducks!" said Lily, holding a pink car. "But first, we need to stop at the shop and buy some bread."
"OK, let's go!" said Ben, and they drove their cars along the carpet.
But then they heard a loud noise from the kitchen. It was their mom, and she sounded angry.
"Oh no, the soup!" they heard her say. "It boiled over and made a big mess on the stove!"
Ben and Lily stopped playing and looked at each other. They knew they had to help their mom. They were alert and good children.
They ran to the kitchen and saw their mom wiping the soup with a cloth. She looked tired and sad.
"Mom, we're sorry!" said Ben and Lily together. "We didn't mean to make you mad. Can we help you?"
Their mom smiled and hugged them. "You're very sweet, my darlings," she said. "But you don't have to worry. It's not your fault. The soup was too hot and I forgot to watch it. It's OK, we can still eat it. But maybe you can help me by setting the table and washing your hands."
"OK, mom!" said Ben and Lily, and they ran to do what she asked. They reversed their cars and parked them in the living room. Then they got some plates and spoons and napkins and put them on the table. They also washed their hands with soap and water.
Soon, they were all sitting at the table, eating the soup. It was still warm and tasty, and they liked it. They also talked about their day and their plans for tomorrow.
They were happy and grateful for their mom and their soup and their cars. They were a good family.
