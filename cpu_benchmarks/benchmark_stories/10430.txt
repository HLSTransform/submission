One day, Arnold and his family were on their way to the park. Arnold was so excited, he could barely wait to get there. He knew it was going to be perfect.
As they drove along in their family vehicle, Arnold noticed an old tractor in the field next to them. He asked his Mom if they could part and go see it. But his Mom said no, they were running late, so they had to keep going.
Arnold was really disappointed. He really wanted to see the old tractor and he knew it was perfect. But they just couldn't part and go see it.
So, Arnold decided to do something. He asked his Dad if they could at least drive by slowly and take a look at it. His Dad smiled and agreed. So, as they drove along, Arnold was so happy, as he was able to catch a glimpse of the tractor. It was perfect!
