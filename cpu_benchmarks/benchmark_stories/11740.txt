Thomas was very excited. He had a special surprise for his family. He had a box of pastels in his hand. They were so beautiful and colourful.
Thomas couldn't wait to share them. He opened the box and smiled as he saw the pastels inside. They were pink, yellow and blue. 
He gave a pastel to his Mom and Dad. They said it was so tasty. He also gave a pastel to his brother, his sister and their puppy. They all said it was delicious.
Thomas was happy. He was glad that he could share the pastels with everyone. He was sure they would have fun making artwork and enjoying the tasty treats.
