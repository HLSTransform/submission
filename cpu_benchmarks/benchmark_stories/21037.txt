One day there was a noisy child playing outside. He was laughing and shouting and having a great time. Suddenly, a man who lived nearby came out of his house and shouted at the child. He said “Do not be so noisy!” The child stopped playing and he looked very unhappy.
The man felt a bit bad for shouting and he tried to explain. He said “I know you were having fun, but I need to sleep. Its very noisy when you play too loudly.” The child nodded and said “OK”.
The man found some toys that he thought the child might like. He said “Please play with these instead. It will be much quieter.” The child smiled and thanked the man. He started playing with the toys and he was having lots of fun. But this time, the noise was much softer and the man was not disturbed.
