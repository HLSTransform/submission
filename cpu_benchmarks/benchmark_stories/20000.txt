Anna loved gum. She liked to chew it and blow big bubbles. She had a special gum that was pink and sweet. She kept it in her pocket.
One day, she went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She took out her gum and put it on a bench. She said to her mom, "I will be back soon. I want to slide."
She ran to the slide and climbed up the ladder. She was proud of herself. She looked down and saw a long, shiny slide. She smiled and slid down. She felt the wind in her hair and the sun on her face. She laughed and said, "Whee!"
She got up and ran back to the bench. She wanted to chew her gum again. But when she got there, she saw that her gum was gone. She looked around and saw a squirrel. The squirrel had her gum in its mouth. It was chewing and blowing bubbles. It looked happy.
Anna was sad and angry. She said to the squirrel, "Hey, that's my gum! Give it back!" She tried to grab the gum, but the squirrel was too fast. It ran away and climbed a tree. It disappeared in the leaves.
Anna cried and said to her mom, "Mom, the squirrel took my gum! It disappeared!" Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Anna. That was not nice of the squirrel. But don't worry, we can buy more gum later. Let's go and play something else."
Anna nodded and wiped her tears. She still missed her gum, but she knew her mom was right. She decided to try the swings instead. She hoped the squirrel would not come back. She hoped it would not like her gum too much. She hoped it would not get a tummy ache.
