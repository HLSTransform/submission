Once upon a time there was a regular old man. He had a very big problem. He had a big barrel full of things, and he had to sort it out before night time. 
The old man got to work sorting the barrel. He worked and worked and worked, but it was too hard. He tried his best, but he wasn't able to finish in time. 
When the night time came, the old man was very sad. He had not been able to sort the barrel. He tried to think of a way out of his problem, but nothing seemed to work.
The old man's problem was still there, and it was too late to do anything about it. The old man had a bad ending and the barrel stayed unsorted.
