Once upon a time, there was a little birdie who lived in a tree. One day, the birdie saw a big, mean cat who wanted to eat him. The birdie was scared and didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, a thick cloud appeared in the sky. The birdie thought it was a good idea to hide in the cloud. But the cat was clever and followed the birdie into the cloud.
Inside the cloud, the cat and the birdie started to fight. The birdie tried to fly away, but the cat was too fast. In the end, the cat caught the birdie and ate him up. The little birdie was no more.
