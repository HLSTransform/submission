Once there was a polite rock. Its name was Betsy and it was very happy. Betsy liked to roll around the garden and it recommended to other rocks that it was lots of fun. But one day, Betsy could not find its friends. It was feeling lonely. 
But then things changed! A little boy came into the garden and saw Betsy. He was happy to see it. He said "Hello, Betsy. I want to take you home. You will make a nice addition to my collection". Betsy was so excited that it jumped for joy and said "Let's go!"
The boy was so gentle and polite with Betsy so it recommended him to all the other rocks in the garden. He took Betsy home and they had lots of fun. 
From that day on, Betsy and the little boy were best of friends. And every day they would go out into the garden to play with the other rocks and they would always recommend the little boy's polite ways.
