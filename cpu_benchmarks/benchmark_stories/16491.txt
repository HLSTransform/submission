Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with yarn. One day, she went outside to pick some pretty flowers. But when she came back inside, she was confused. She couldn't find her yarn anywhere! 
Lily looked all around the house, but still no yarn. She asked her mom and dad if they had seen it, but they hadn't. Finally, Lily's little brother came up to her with a big smile on his face. He had picked up the yarn and was playing with it! 
Lily was happy that she found her yarn, but a little confused why her brother had it. She gently took it from him and went back to playing with it. From then on, she made sure to keep her yarn in a safe place where her brother couldn't pick it up again.
