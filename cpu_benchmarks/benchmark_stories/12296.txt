Jack was a brave little boy who wanted to play outside. He ran outside and found a long tunnel in the grass. He wanted to go in, but it was very dark. Frustrated, he tried to squeeze through, but was too big. So, he decided to kneel down and crawl in. Suddenly, he felt something furry and heard a purr. It was a big, white kitty! 
The kitty meowed and started to walk down the tunnel. Jack followed. After a while, he saw the tunnel opening and he saw that the kitty was going home. Jack realized that he was the kitty's buddy on his journey. 
Jack waved goodbye to the cat and went home, feeling happy and excited about his adventure. Even though he was only a little boy, he had been able to help the kitty find his way. 
The moral of the story is that even when you are small and seem powerless, you can still find a way to help others.
