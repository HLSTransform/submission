Once upon a time there was a great wizard. He was so incredible that no one could understand his magic. He had a special razor that could do anything.
One day, the wizard wanted to make a beautiful bird fly. He took out his razor and waved it in the air. Suddenly, a bird appeared from nowhere and began to fly high in the sky. The wizard was so amazed.
The wizard continued to do many more incredible things with his razor. He made an apple tree appear and grew wonderful fruits. He also used his razor to make rainbows appear in the sky. Everyone in the village was in awe of the wizard and his razor.
The wizard was so happy with the things he could do. Finally, he understood the power of his razor and of his magic.
