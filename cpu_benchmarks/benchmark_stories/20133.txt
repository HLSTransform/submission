Lily and Ben were playing with their toy animals in the garden. They had a big box with many animals, like lions, elephants, monkeys and snakes. They liked to make noises and pretend they were in the jungle.
But one day, a snake escaped from the box. It was a green and yellow snake, with a shiny scale on its back. It slithered away, looking for a place to hide. Lily and Ben did not see it, they were too busy playing.
The snake found a hole under the fence. It crawled inside, hoping to find some food. But it was a bad idea. On the other side of the fence, there was a big dog. The dog saw the snake and barked loudly. It wanted to catch the snake and play with it.
The snake was scared and confused. It did not know what to do. It tried to go back to the hole, but the dog was too fast. It blocked the hole with its paw. The snake hissed and coiled, ready to bite.
Lily and Ben heard the noise. They stopped playing and looked at the fence. They saw the dog and the snake. They were worried and curious.
"Look, Ben, it's our snake!" Lily said. "How did it escape?"
"I don't know, Lily. Maybe it was bored in the box." Ben said. "We have to save it. The dog is angry."
They ran to the fence and called the dog. They tried to make it go away. They threw some sticks and stones. They shouted and clapped. But the dog did not listen. It wanted the snake.
The snake was in trouble. It had no place to go. It wished it was back in the box, with the other animals. It wished it never escaped.
