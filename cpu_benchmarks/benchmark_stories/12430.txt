Once upon a time there was a wild little girl called Emma. 
One day Emma went with her mum and dad to the park. Emma was so excited to see all the trees and animals.
After a while, she saw a pond with some big fish jumping in it. She wanted to see them up close, so she tried to get to the pond. 
But the ground was bumpy and Emma struggled to get there. Mum and Dad helped her, telling her not to give up. 
Finally, Emma reached the pond and she was delighted. She saw the fish jumping and swimming about. She wanted to get in the water too but Mum said, "No Emma, the water is too cold, and it has no value for you."
Emma was disappointed, but she knew that Mum was right. She said, "OK, I'll be careful." 
So she stayed on the bank and watched the wild fish jumping around in the pond.
