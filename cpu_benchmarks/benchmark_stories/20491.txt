John had a great day. He and his sister went to the shop. They saw lots of orange things. John wanted to buy some orange candy so he pointed at it. His sister said no but gave him some money to play with instead.
John was so excited. He put the money in his pocket and skipped down the street. He found a park with a slide. He climbed up and went down again, again and again. He played so much it made him tired.
John saw a shop selling orange balloons. He wanted to buy one, but didn't have any money left. He asked his sister but she said no.
John was disappointed but he kept playing. He found a muddy puddle and squished in his toes. He loved how it felt and he laughed and laughed. Then he ran back to the orange shop. 
John pointed at the orange balloons again but this time his sister said yes! He bought one and it was so bright and happy. The orange balloon was the best part of his day. He carried it back home and played with it in his bedroom until he fell asleep.
