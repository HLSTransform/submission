Fiona and Lily were best friends. They both loved going to the park together after school. One day, Fiona was feeling extra excited. 
"Come on, Lily!", said Fiona. "Let's have a competition. Let's see who can do a cartwheel first!" 
Lily was excited. She wanted to win. But she was a little scared, too. This was her first time trying a cartwheel.
"We can do it, Fiona!", said Lily.
Fiona and Lily both tried their hardest. After lots of hard work, Fiona finally managed to win the competition.
"Yay!", said Fiona. "I'm so independent!"
Lily was happy for her friend. She was also proud of herself for being brave and trying the cartwheel. 
"I'm proud of you, too, Lily", said Fiona. "We'll have a special lunch to celebrate!"
Fiona and Lily both gave each other a big hug. They were both proud of their own independence, and they were happy they had each other to celebrate their victory.
