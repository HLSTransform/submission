Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to travel to different places and see new things. One day, he went on a trip with his mommy and daddy. They packed everything they needed in a big, brown barrel.
During the trip, Timmy felt uncomfortable because he was sitting for a long time in the car. "Mommy, my bottom hurts. Can we stop and take a break?" Timmy asked. "Sure thing, Timmy. Let's find a nice spot to rest," his mommy replied.
They found a cozy picnic area where they could stretch their legs and have some snacks. Timmy felt much better and happy to continue their journey. "I like traveling with you guys. It's fun!" Timmy said with a big smile. His mommy and daddy smiled back, happy to hear their little boy's excitement.
