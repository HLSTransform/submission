John and his family went on a trip to the zoo. “We are going to spend the day looking at animals!” said John excitedly. 
John spotted a rhinoceros in the corner. It looked so big and strong! He walked up closer to take a better look, and the rhinocerous moved its head to look at him. “Greeting, rhino!” said John with a smile.
John’s dad said, “That rhinoceros looks very wise! You can really tell from the way it looks at you. Let’s spend some time looking at it.” 
John and his dad watched the rhinoceros for a while, fascinated by how wise it looked. John waved goodbye to the rhinoceros and said, “Have a good day, rhino!”  Then they went to look at all the other animals in the zoo.
