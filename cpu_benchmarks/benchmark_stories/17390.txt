Lila and Sam are twins. They like to play together. Today, they want to play with cars and trucks. They have many cars and trucks in their toy box.
"Let's make a road with blocks," Sam says. He takes out some blocks and starts to build a road on the floor.
"OK," Lila says. She takes out some cars and trucks and puts them on the road. "But we need some traffic signs, too."
She looks around the room and sees some paper and crayons. She has an idea. She is very creative. She takes the paper and crayons and starts to draw some traffic signs. She draws a stop sign, a yield sign, a green light and a red light.
"Look, Sam, I made some traffic signs," Lila says. She shows him her drawings.
"Wow, Lila, they are very good," Sam says. He likes her drawings. He takes some tape and sticks the traffic signs on the blocks.
"Now we can play with the cars and trucks and follow the traffic signs," Sam says.
They start to play with the cars and trucks. They take turns to choose which car or truck to drive. They follow the traffic signs and stop and go when they see the green and red lights. They have a lot of fun.
They play until their mom calls them for lunch. They put their cars and trucks and blocks and paper and crayons back in the toy box.
"Did you have fun, Lila and Sam?" their mom asks.
"Yes, mom, we had fun," they say. "We played with cars and trucks and made traffic signs."
"That sounds very creative," their mom says. "I'm proud of you."
She gives them a hug and a kiss and takes them to the kitchen for lunch.
