Once upon a time there was a boy named Joe. He was very charming. One day, he saw a big bowl. It was full of pitch. He filled a cup with the pitch and then he started to pour it into the bowl. The pitch poured from the cup into the bowl like a waterfall. Joe was so happy. He had made a big pile of pitch in the bowl. Joe was so proud of himself and smiled. He decided to make something special with the pitch. He found some sticks and stones and started to build a house. It took Joe a few hours to finish the house, but it looked charming.
