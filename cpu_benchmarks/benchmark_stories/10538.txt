Once there was a red parade. It was a special parade, and many people enjoyed it.
But then something happened. All of the people were not able to complete the parade.
They were so sad, because they had wanted to finish what they started. But they could not and had to leave before it was done. 
They were all very upset, and some even had tears in their eyes. They all wanted to finish the parade, but it was too late.
So they sadly said goodbye, and went on their way. The red parade was never able to be completed.
