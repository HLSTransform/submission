Once upon a time, there was an old man. He was taking a walk in the park when he found something shiny. It was a button! He liked it so much that he decided to put it in his pocket.
The old man went home. He showed the button to his dog who wanted to play with it. So he put the button on the floor and the dog began to crawl with it. The old man and the dog had lots of fun together until the button got stuck in a small crack in the floor.
The old man and the dog tried very hard to get the button out. But it was too narrow and the button wouldn't budge. So the old man put his hands on the ground and started to crawl. He felt around with his fingers until he finally got a hold of the button.
He was so happy to have it back! The old man thanked the dog and put the button back in his pocket. Then he gave the dog a big hug for all his help. 
From then on, the old man always made sure he put the button somewhere safe.
