Sara and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. But sometimes they did not share well. One day, Sara found a fragile doll that belonged to their mom when she was little. She wanted to dress it up and comb its hair.
"Look, Ben, this is my doll now. She is so pretty and old. You can't touch her or she will break," Sara said.
Ben felt angry. He wanted to play with the doll too. He did not like that Sara ignored him. He tried to grab the doll from Sara, but she held it tight.
"Stop it, Ben! You are mean and rude. Go away and leave me alone," Sara shouted.
Ben did not listen. He pulled harder and harder. Sara screamed and cried. The doll's arm snapped off and fell to the floor. Sara and Ben both gasped. They knew they were in trouble.
Mom heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw the broken doll and the sad twins. She was very upset.
"What have you done? This was my special doll. How could you be so careless and selfish? You need to learn to share and be gentle. Now you both have to take a nap and think about what you did," Mom said.
Sara and Ben felt sorry. They hugged each other and said they were sorry. They picked up the doll's arm and gave it to Mom. They hoped she could fix it. They went to their beds and took a nap. They dreamed of playing nicely with each other and the doll.
