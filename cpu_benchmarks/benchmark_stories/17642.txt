Once, there was a tall man. He had a trumpet. He was always making lots of noise and annoying the people in the town.
One day, the people decided to punish the tall man. They wanted him to stop making lots of noise.
So, everyone in the town got together and built a wall around the tall man. Then, they told him that he wasn't allowed to play his trumpet anymore.
At first, the tall man was very sad and he just sat alone in his little room. Then, one day, he decided to surprise everyone by making a different kind of music. He used his trumpet to make a beautiful melody that everyone could enjoy.
The people were very happy and they celebrated his music. From then on, the tall man only used his trumpet to make beautiful music, and the town was happier and much quieter.
