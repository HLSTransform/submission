Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved playing in the park and making new friends. One day, she met a new friend named Timmy. Timmy was very nice and always shared his toys with Lily. They played together every day and had lots of fun.
One day, Timmy brought some candy to share with Lily. But Lily knew she wasn't supposed to take candy from strangers. She told Timmy she couldn't take the candy because her mommy told her not to trust strangers. Timmy was sad, but he understood and they continued to play.
Later that day, Lily's mommy told her a story about a princess who was given a poison apple by a stranger. The princess didn't know the apple was poisoned and she ate it. She got very sick and almost died. Lily's mommy told her that it's always important to be careful and not take things from strangers, even if it seems easy.
Lily learned an important lesson that day. She knew she could always trust her mommy to keep her safe. And she knew to be careful and not take things from strangers.
