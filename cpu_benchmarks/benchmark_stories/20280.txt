Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to dance. She danced all day and all night. Sue had a big smile when she danced.
One day, Sue's mom made some dough. The dough was soft and squishy. Sue had an idea. She made an adorable dough friend who could dance with her. Sue named her dough friend Dolly.
Sue and Dolly danced together every day. They were very happy. One day, it rained outside. Sue and Dolly danced in the rain. They got wet and had so much fun. The rain stopped, and the sun came out. Dolly the dough friend got warm and started to change.
Dolly the dough friend became a real friend! Sue and Dolly were so happy. They danced and danced, and they were best friends forever.
