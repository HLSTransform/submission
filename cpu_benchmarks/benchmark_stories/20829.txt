Once upon a time there was a brave girl. She loved to paint. She wanted to paint her armchair and make it look beautiful. But it was very hard work and she was scared of making a mess. 
One day, her mom said to her, "If you are brave and try something new, you will find it is really fun and exciting!"
So the brave girl painted her armchair. She loved how it looked when it was finished. Everyday she would sit in her chair and feel very proud of her bravery. 
The moral of the story is that when we are brave and try something new, it is really fun and exciting.
