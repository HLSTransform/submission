Mandy was a very intelligent girl. She loved to mix things together to see what would happen. One day, Mandy was playing in her room when she found her old skeleton in the closet. She was very excited to mix it up with something!
Mandy got her mixing bowl and spoon out and put the skeleton in. Then she added some flour, sugar, and milk. She mixed and mixed until she had a thick goop. She couldn't wait to see what would happen once she was done!
Mandy put her mixture inside her skeleton. She smiled as it slowly filled up, excited to see what it would look like. After a few minutes, Mandy had a brand new creepy skeleton! She was very proud of it and decided to take it with her everywhere.
Mandyâ€™s friends were impressed with her intelligent mix of the skeleton. Everyone wanted to see what she would come up with next!
