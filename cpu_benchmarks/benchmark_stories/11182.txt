Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys, especially her teddy bear. One day, Lily's friend came over to play, but she accidentally broke her teddy bear. Lily was sad and didn't know what to do.
Suddenly, a stranger knocked on the door. The stranger asked Lily if she could borrow her favorite toy for a little while. Lily didn't know the stranger, but she thought it was important to be kind and share. So, she let the stranger borrow her teddy bear.
But as time went on, the stranger didn't return with the teddy bear. Lily was upset and didn't know what to do. She learned an important lesson that day about not trusting strangers and being careful when lending her toys.
