Once there was a little girl named Sarah. She was very anxious to eat cake. She loved cake! Every day she would ask her mom if she could have cake, but her mom always said no. 
One day, Sarah saw a big cake in her kitchen! She ran to her mom and asked if she could eat the cake. Her mom said yes! 
Sarah was so excited. She ate the cake quickly, not wanting to share it with her siblings. She put her plate in the sink and ran to play with her toys.
The cake tasted so yummy! Now Sarah was never anxious to eat cake again. She knew she could ask her mom whenever she wanted to enjoy some cake.
