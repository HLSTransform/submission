Once upon a time, there was an ancient man. He had a big exam to take but he was very scared. He was very worried he would not pass.
So the ancient man went to his friend. He asked if his friend could help him. The friend said yes, and he showed the ancient man a special way to pass his exam. All the man had to do was to forgive himself.
The ancient man was very happy. He thanked his friend and he tried the special way. He felt brave and he was ready for the exam.
On the day of the exam, the ancient man did very well. He passed the exam and everyone was very happy. The ancient man was glad he chose the special way and he thanked his friend again. 
From that day onwards, the ancient man was happy. He had learned a very important lesson - to forgive himself.
