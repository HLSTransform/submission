Lily and Tom were at the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and giraffes. But their favorite animal was the hippo. The hippo was big and gray, and it liked to swim in the water.
"Look, mom, the hippo is so dirty!" Lily said. "It has mud all over its skin."
"That's how hippos stay cool and protect themselves from the sun," mom explained. "They also have very thick skin, so they don't feel the bites of bugs."
"Can we touch the hippo, mom?" Tom asked.
"No, sweetie, the hippo is too dangerous to touch. It has very big teeth and it can bite very hard. We can only watch it from a safe distance," mom said.
Lily and Tom nodded. They understood that the hippo was not a pet, but a wild animal. They decided to wave at the hippo and say hello.
"Hello, hippo!" they shouted. "You are very big and dirty, but we like you!"
The hippo heard them and lifted its head from the water. It opened its mouth and made a loud noise. It sounded like a laugh.
"Did the hippo laugh at us, mom?" Lily asked.
"Maybe it did, or maybe it said hello back," mom said. "We don't know what the hippo thinks, but we can imagine."
Lily and Tom smiled. They liked to imagine what the hippo thought. They decided to make up a story about the hippo and its friends in the water. They had fun at the zoo.
