One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. They saw a big, clear sky with the sun shining down on them. Tim was very happy to play outside.
Tim saw a swing and ran to it. He wanted to sit on it, but he was too small. His mom said, "Let me help you, Tim." She lifted him up and seated him on the swing. Tim held on tight and his mom pushed him. He felt like he was flying.
As Tim swung back and forth, he saw a big bird fly over his head. The bird said, "Hello, Tim!" Tim smiled and said, "Hello, bird!" They both enjoyed the sunny day at the park.
