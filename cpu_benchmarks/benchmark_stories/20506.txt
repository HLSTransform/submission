Jill and her dad were on a long walk. Suddenly, dad's phone beeped. He looked at his phone and showed a sign to Jill. It was dark and it said 'supply'. Dad said with a smile: "Let's go, Jill. We have to do a job."
They drove in the car for a while and soon stopped. Jill and her dad went out of the car and walked to a house. It was already dark outside. 
They knocked on the door and a nice lady opened. Dad gave the lady the sign with 'supply' on it. The lady smiled and gave them a box full of items. Dad said that it was the supply they were looking for. 
Jill and dad were happy to have done the job. They said their goodbyes and went back in the car. They both knew that they had done a great job.
