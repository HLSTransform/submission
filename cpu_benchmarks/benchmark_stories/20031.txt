Lily and Ben liked to play with their toys. They had a big box of toys with many things inside. One day, they found a new toy in the box. It was a small machine with a red button and a black wire. The wire had a round thing at the end. It looked like a bell.
"What is this?" Lily asked.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a phone," Ben said.
They pressed the red button and heard a beep. Then they spoke into the bell.
"Hello, hello, can you hear me?" Lily said.
"Hello, hello, I can hear you," Ben said.
They laughed and took turns talking into the bell. They did not know that the machine was a recorder. It was recording everything they said.
After a while, they got bored and put the machine back in the box. They played with other toys. They forgot about the machine.
The next day, their mom came to the room. She saw the machine in the box and was curious. She pressed the red button and heard a beep. Then she heard Lily and Ben's voices.
"Hello, hello, can you hear me?"
"Hello, hello, I can hear you."
She smiled and listened to their conversation. They said many funny and weird things. They talked about their toys, their dreams, their friends, and their secrets.
Mom thought it was very cute and sweet. She decided to keep the machine and the recording. She wanted to remember how Lily and Ben sounded when they were little. She thought it was a precious gift.
