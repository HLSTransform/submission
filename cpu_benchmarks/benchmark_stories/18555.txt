Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl named Lily. She loved to go to the park with her mom and dad. One day, they saw a vendor selling hot dogs. Lily's tummy started to growl, and she wanted a hot dog. Her mom bought her one, and Lily smiled with joy. She ate her hot dog and felt very happy.
