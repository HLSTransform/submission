Anna and Ben are playing hide and seek in the park. Anna is the seeker and Ben is the hider. Ben runs behind a big tree and waits for Anna to find him. He thinks he is very clever and Anna will not see him.
Anna counts to ten and then opens her eyes. She looks around and wonders where Ben is. She sees a swing, a slide, a bench, and some flowers, but no Ben. She walks around and calls his name. "Ben, where are you? I want to find you!"
Ben hears Anna and giggles. He thinks Anna will never find him. He is hidden very well. He stays quiet and does not answer. He hopes Anna will give up and he will win the game.
Anna does not give up. She is a good seeker and likes to find things. She thinks Ben must be somewhere near. She looks behind the tree and sees a pair of shoes sticking out. She smiles and runs to the tree. She pulls Ben out and says, "I found you! You are not hidden very well. Your shoes gave you away!"
Ben is surprised and sad. He thought he was hidden very well. He did not think Anna would see his shoes. He says, "You are a very good seeker, Anna. You found me. You win the game."
Anna is happy and hugs Ben. She says, "You are a very good hider, Ben. You made me wonder a lot. You almost won the game. Do you want to play again?"
Ben nods and smiles. He says, "Yes, I want to play again. But this time, I will hide better. And you will not find me!"
Anna and Ben laugh and run to a new spot. They play hide and seek again and have a lot of fun. They are good friends and like to play together.
