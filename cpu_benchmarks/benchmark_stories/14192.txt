Once upon a time, there was a little girl named May. She was walking in the park one day and stopped at a fountain. She was having so much fun playing with the ideas of the fountain, jumping in, and splashing around. All of a sudden, a serious looking man appeared and said, "You must leave the fountain now." May was very scared, but she had the courage to stay put. She told the man that it was her favorite place to play and she didn't want to leave. The man's face turned into a more serious expression, and he said again, "You must leave the fountain now!" May knew that she had to leave, so she sadly obeyed the man's orders and left the fountain. She was sad, but she also knew that sometimes being serious is necessary.
