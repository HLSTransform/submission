Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big tree with many leaves. They wanted to climb the tree and see what was up there.
"Let's go, Lily!" Ben said. "Maybe we can find a bird or a squirrel."
"OK, Ben!" Lily said. "But be careful. The tree is very high."
They ran to the tree and started to climb. They used their hands and feet to hold on to the branches. They went higher and higher. They felt happy and brave.
But then, Lily saw something strange. On one of the branches, there was a long and thin thing. It was brown and hairy. It looked like a leg. But it was not a leg of a bird or a squirrel. It was a leg of something else.
"Ben, look!" Lily said. "What is that?"
Ben looked where Lily pointed. He saw the leg too. He did not know what it was. He felt scared and curious.
"I don't know, Lily," Ben said. "It is very mysterious. Maybe it is a leg of a monster."
They both stared at the leg. They wanted to know what it was. They wanted to touch it. But they also wanted to run away.
They did not see that the leg moved. They did not hear that the leg made a sound. They did not think that the leg had a friend.
Suddenly, another leg came out of the leaves. It was also brown and hairy. It was also long and thin. It was also a leg of something else.
"Hello!" the leg said. "Who are you?"
