Once there was a boy named Joe. He was three years old and he loved to skip around the garden. He was wearing a bright blue shirt and a wide grin.
Joe ran around the garden, skipping and laughing as he went. The sun was shining and it was so warm and nice outside. Then it started to rain. Joe stopped skipping and looked up at the sky. It was wet! He wiggled his toes in the wet grass.
But then Joe heard a sound coming from the sky. It was thunder! Joe started to feel scared, but then a rainbow appeared in the sky. Joe felt glad when he looked at the rainbow. He started to skip around the garden again, even though it was still wet.
He skipped in the rain and sang and laughed. Joe knew that everything was okay when it rained. He was glad and happy
