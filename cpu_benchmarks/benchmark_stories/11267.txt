Once upon a time there lived a little girl called Rachel. She was a very playful girl. Every day she would go to the park to play on the swings, slide and ride the bikes.
One day, while Rachel was playing on the swings, she saw a strange figure. It was big and tall and made Rachel feel scared. She asked her friend, "What is that figure?" Her friend replied with a scared face, "I don't know, but it's scaring me too."
At that moment, Rachel and her friend heard a loud noise coming from the strange figure. It was getting closer and closer to them. Rachel thought quickly and said, "Let's hide behind that tree over there." She and her friend ran and hid behind the tree, trying to keep quiet.
But the figure still found them. It was a playful monster! The monster wanted to play with them, so they all played tag and hide-and-seek until it was time to go home. Rachel and her friend were so happy they weren't scared anymore. They waved goodbye to their playful new friend, and went home feeling brave.
