Once upon a time there was a fat, green bell. Every day it would ring loudly in the garden. Everyone in the village heard it and smiled.
One day, a red bird flew by and hopped onto the bell. He wanted to show the village a new color. He started to chirp loudly and flapped his wings.
The bird's singing made the bell start ringing even louder than before. Everyone in the village loved it and cheered.
The green bell was so happy that it kept ringing for days. Everyone heard it and it made them so happy.
The end.
