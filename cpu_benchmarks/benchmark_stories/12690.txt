Jack was playing in the garden one day when he heard a tiny cry coming from behind the tree. He went to investigate and found a small caterpillar nestled in the grass. He carefully picked it up and noticed it had a broken wing. He had to help it! 
Jack ran inside and asked his dad for some glue. His dad found some and gave it to Jack.
Jack took the glue and some leaves and went back to the caterpillar. He used the glue to carefully stick the leaves together and make a little patch for the caterpillar's broken wing. Now it could fly again! 
The caterpillar thanked Jack. Jack was so pleased that he gave it a little pinch on the cheek to show his appreciation.
But then, a selfish spider came along and scolded the caterpillar.
"You shouldn't have accepted Jack's help," he said. "You will have to do everything yourself now." 
Jack was furious. He looked at the spider with his big eyes and said sternly, "It's better to be kind and help others, than to be selfish like you!" 
The spider scurried away and Jack smiled. He had taught the spider an important lesson!
