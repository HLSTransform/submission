Anna and her mom went to the park. Anna liked to play on the swings and the slide. She saw a big dog with a man. The dog was brown and fluffy. Anna wanted to pet the dog.
"Mom, can I pet the dog?" Anna asked.
"Only if the man says it's okay," her mom said. "He is a stranger. You have to be careful with strangers. They might not be nice."
Anna nodded. She walked to the man and the dog. She smiled and said, "Hello, I like your dog. Can I pet him?"
The man was open. He smiled back and said, "Sure, you can pet him. His name is Rex. He is very friendly."
Anna reached out her hand to touch Rex. Rex wagged his tail and licked her hand. Anna giggled. She felt happy. She trusted Rex and the man.
But then, something bad happened. The man grabbed Anna's arm and tried to pull her away. He said, "Come with me, little girl. I have a surprise for you."
Anna was scared. She screamed, "No, no, let me go! Mom, help!"
Her mom heard her cry. She ran to Anna and the man. She pushed the man away and hugged Anna. She said, "Are you okay, Anna? I'm here, I'm here."
The man ran away. He was not open. He was not nice. He was a bad stranger.
Anna cried and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I thought he was nice. I thought I could trust him."
Her mom said, "It's okay, Anna. You didn't do anything wrong. You were brave and smart. You screamed and called for me. You don't have to trust strangers. You only have to trust me. I love you, Anna."
Anna said, "I love you too, mom. Thank you for saving me."
They hugged and kissed. They went home. Anna learned a lesson. She never talked to strangers again. She only played with her mom and her friends. She was safe and happy.
