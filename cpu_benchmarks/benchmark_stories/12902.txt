Once there was a train that wanted to travel. It went along the track, singing a happy song.
"Where can I go?" the train asked.
"The track is long, so you can go anywhere you like," said a bird.
The train happily chugged along the track until it got to a dull part of the track. The trees were all gray and there were no other trains.
"This part of the track is too dull," said the train.
"Maybe you can travel back the other way," said the bird.
So the train turned around and chugged back the other way. Finally it found a colorful part of the track with lots of other trains and trees. The train was so happy, it sang a different song.
"This part of the track is so much better!" said the train happily.
The bird smiled and said, "That's why it's important to travel."
