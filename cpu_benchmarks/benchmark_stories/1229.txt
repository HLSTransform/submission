Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. Lily was a normal girl who loved to play outside. One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. At the park, Lily saw a pretty flower and wanted to take it home. Her mom said it was okay to take the flower, but Lily needed to ask for the flower's name first. 
Lily asked the flower what its name was, but the flower did not answer. So, Lily decided to give the flower a name herself. She called it "Sunshine" because it was as bright and happy as the sun. Lily took Sunshine home and put it in a vase on her windowsill. 
Every day, Lily would say hello to Sunshine and tell it all about her day. Sunshine didn't talk back, but Lily didn't mind. She was happy just having a friend to talk to. And that's how Lily and Sunshine became the best of friends. The end.
