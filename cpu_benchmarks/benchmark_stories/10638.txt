Amy went to the park with her mom. She saw a big black dog and she wanted to pet it.
Amy's mom said, "No, sorry Amy. You can't pet the dog." Amy started to cry.
Amy looked at the dog and it looked back at her. Amy wiped away her tears and the dog seemed to understand. It gently wagged its tail. Amy smiled.
Mom said, "I'm sorry Amy. I just want you to be careful around dogs. You never know how they will react."
Amy nodded and said, "Ok, but can I just look at it?" Mom smiled and said, "Yes. You can look but don't get too close."
Amy looked at the black dog and smiled. She waved to the dog and the dog waved back. Amy and the dog were friends now.
