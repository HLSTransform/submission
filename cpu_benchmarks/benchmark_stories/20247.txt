Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived with her mom and dad in a small house near the beach. Lily loved to play in the sand and swim in the water. Every day, she would hope that she could go to the beach and have fun with her friends.
One day, Lily's mom told her that they could not go to the beach. Lily was upset. She didn't understand why they couldn't go. Her mom said it was because the sky was dark, and it was going to rain. Lily was sad, but she knew her mom was right.
Lily hoped that the sun would come out soon so she could go to the beach again. She waited and waited. Finally, the next day, the sun was shining bright. Lily was so happy! She ran to the beach with her mom and dad, and they played in the sand and swam in the water all day long.
