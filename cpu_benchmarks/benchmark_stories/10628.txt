Once there were two brothers named Dave and Tom. Dave was upset because Tom had a pistol. He wanted to have it too. But Tom said he couldn't give Dave his pistol because it wasn't safe. Dave got angry and Tom got scared.
Dave asked Tom why he wouldn't give him the pistol. Tom said he was just trying to keep Dave safe, and he still wanted to play with him. Dave calmed down a bit and said he just wanted to have the pistol too.
Tom thought about it and decided it would be OK to give Dave his pistol if he promised to be careful. Dave was so happy that he gave Tom a big hug and thanked him.
Dave and Tom continued to have fun together, and Dave was very careful with his pistol. Dave and Tom learned it was OK to share and it was important to think about safety.
