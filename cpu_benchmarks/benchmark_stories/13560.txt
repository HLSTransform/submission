Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toy cars and trucks. One day, Timmy's little sister came into his room and started to disturb his toys. Timmy didn't like that because he wanted to play with them all by himself.
Timmy's dad came into the room and saw that Timmy was confused about what to do. Dad asked Timmy's sister to leave the room so that Timmy could play with his toys in peace. Timmy's dad noticed that one of Timmy's toy cars had a motor that wasn't working properly. Dad promised Timmy that he would fix it so that it would work again.
After Dad fixed the motor, Timmy was very happy and he played with his toy cars and trucks all day long. Timmy's sister learned not to disturb his toys anymore and they all played together happily ever after. The end.
