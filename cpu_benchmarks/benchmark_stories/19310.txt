Once upon a time there was a fast hare. He wanted to go on an adventure but he was not sure where to go. He asked his mum, who said he must get permission first. So the hare went to ask his dad who said he must ask his big brother. 
Big brother thought it was a good idea. He said the hare could go on the adventure as long as he was home by dinner. So the hare went off on his adventure and had a wonderful time. He played in the park and ate yummy food. 
When it was time to go back home, the hare was so happy he had gone on the adventure. He thought it was the best thing he had ever done. He asked his brothers and sisters what they thought. Each of them had their own opinion. 
But in the end, the hare decided that going on adventures was a very fun and exciting thing to do. He was lucky to have his family's permission, and he hoped they would let him go on another one soon!
