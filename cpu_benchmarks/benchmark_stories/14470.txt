Once upon a time, there was a cross. The cross was very old and stood in the middle of a field. Every day, a stubborn donkey would pass by the cross and stop to look at it. He was drawn to the cross and thought it might be something special. 
One day, the donkey asked the cross what it was there for. The cross answered that it was there to serve. The donkey didn't understand, so he asked what it meant to serve. The cross told the donkey that it was there to help people.
The donkey decided he wanted to help people too. So, he began to stand next to the cross every day. He moved grass and plants away from the cross, so it would stand out more and people could see it better. Then the donkey would watch and wait, hoping to help people passing by.
The stubborn donkey kept serving, even when it was tough. Soon, people started to notice the cross and the friendly donkey, who had dedicated his days to helping others. Years passed, and the cross and donkey had become an important part of the area. People were thankful to the cross and the stubborn donkey, who had worked so hard to serve.
