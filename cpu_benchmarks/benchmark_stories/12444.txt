Sam and Mia were friends who liked to play outside. They liked to run, jump, and march like soldiers. One day, they saw a big dog near the park. The dog was black and brown, and had sharp teeth. Sam and Mia were not afraid of dogs, but they were alert. They knew some dogs were nice, and some dogs were mean.
"Hello, doggy!" Sam said, and smiled. He wanted to pet the dog, but Mia stopped him.
"Wait, Sam. We don't know this dog. Maybe he is not friendly. Maybe he will bite us," Mia said, and pulled Sam back.
The dog looked at Sam and Mia, and growled. He did not like strangers. He did not want to be petted. He wanted to be left alone. He was angry and scared.
"Go away, doggy! We don't want to play with you!" Mia said, and threw a stick at the dog. She hoped the dog would chase the stick, and leave them alone.
But the dog did not chase the stick. He chased Mia and Sam. He ran fast, and barked loud. He wanted to catch them, and hurt them.
Mia and Sam were scared. They ran away, and screamed for help. They tried to find their mom and dad, or someone who could help them. But the dog was faster, and stronger. He caught Sam, and bit his leg. Sam fell down, and cried. Mia tried to help Sam, but the dog bit her arm. Mia fell down, and cried too.
The dog was not happy. He was still angry and scared. He did not stop biting. He bit Sam and Mia again and again, until they stopped crying. Until they stopped moving. Until they were still and quiet.
The dog ran away, and hid. He did not want to be found. He did not want to be punished. He did not know what he had done.
Sam and Mia did not play outside anymore. They did not run, jump, or march like soldiers. They did not smile, or talk, or laugh. They did not do anything. They were gone.
