Once upon a time, there was a wide tree in a big park. Under the tree, there was a shiny metal swing. Kids loved to play on the swing all day. One sunny day, a little bird was flying in the sky. The bird was very tired and needed to rest.
The bird saw the wide tree and the metal swing. It thought, "I can rest on the swing." So, the little bird flew down and sat on the metal swing. The bird was happy to rest, but it was not safe. The kids wanted to play on the swing, and they did not see the bird.
A kind mom saw the bird and told the kids, "Wait! Let the bird rest." The kids stopped and let the bird rest on the swing. After a while, the bird felt better and flew away. The kids learned to be kind and let others rest when they need it. And they all played happily ever after.
