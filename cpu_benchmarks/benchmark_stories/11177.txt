Once upon a time, there was a little car named Red. Red liked to go fast and zoom around. One day, Red's engine started to make a funny noise. Red felt anxious because he didn't want to stop going. 
Red's owner, Tim, took him to the mechanic. The mechanic checked under Red's hood and found that he needed some oil. The mechanic put some oil in Red's engine and he felt much better. 
Red was happy to go fast again and Tim was happy that Red was fixed. They went on a fun adventure together and Red didn't have to worry about his engine anymore. The end.
