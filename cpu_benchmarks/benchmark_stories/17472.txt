Sam and Tom were brothers who liked to play in the park. They had a big boat that they could row on the pond. Sam was older and stronger, and he liked to row fast and make waves. Tom was younger and smaller, and he liked to row slow and watch the ducks.
One day, they went to the park with their boat. Sam said, "Let's have a race. I bet I can row faster than you." Tom said, "No, thank you. I like to row slow." Sam said, "You are lazy and scared. I dare you to race me." Tom said, "No, I am not. I just like to row slow." Sam said, "Fine. Then I will row by myself and you can watch me win."
Sam took the boat and rowed to the other side of the pond. He turned around and shouted, "Look at me. I am the fastest rower in the world." Tom watched him and smiled. He saw something that Sam did not see. He saw a big swan that was angry at Sam for making waves. The swan swam towards Sam and hissed.
Sam heard the hiss and looked back. He saw the swan and got scared. He tried to row away, but the swan was faster. The swan caught up with him and pecked at his boat. Sam screamed and dropped his oars. The boat tipped over and Sam fell into the water.
Tom saw what happened and ran to help. He grabbed another boat and rowed to Sam. He pulled him out of the water and into the boat. He said, "Are you okay, Sam?" Sam said, "Yes, thank you, Tom. You saved me." Tom said, "You're welcome, Sam. Next time, maybe you should not dare the swan." Sam said, "You're right, Tom. Next time, maybe we should row slow and watch the ducks." They rowed back to the shore and hugged. They learned their lesson and never dared the swan again.
