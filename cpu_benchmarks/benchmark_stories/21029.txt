One day, Tommy and his mom were walking in the park.
Tommy saw something hidden under the bushes. He asked his mom, "What is that?"
His mom answered, "It looks like an iron. Let's talk to the person who put it there."
So they looked around and called out. Then a man with a hat came to them.
The man said, "I put my iron there because I could not find it. I was so happy to see it again!"
Tommy and his mom smiled. Then Tommy said, "Can I see it?"
The man said, "Sure, take it." Tommy was so excited.
He and his mom talked about it all the way home. Tommy was happy to have found such a hidden treasure.
