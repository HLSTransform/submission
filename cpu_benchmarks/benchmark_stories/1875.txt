Once upon a time there was a girl who loved puzzles. She loved the feeling of putting them together. One day she had a big plan. She was going to put together a light puzzle.
She took some time to work on it. Every now and then she needed help from her mommy. She asked questions like, “Does this piece go here?” and “How do I make this part fit?”
Everyday she would take small breaks to show her progress. Still, she kept working and trying.
Finally, after lots of hard work, she finished her puzzle. She screamed “I did it! I finished my puzzle!”
Her mommy, who was standing nearby, smiled. “I knew you could do it!”
The girl was so proud, and the puzzle glowed a bright happy light. It was so pretty that she wanted to show it to everyone.
The end.
