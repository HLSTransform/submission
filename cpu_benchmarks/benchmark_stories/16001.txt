Once upon a time, there was a spring with a magical pond. Every day, during spring, animals from all over traveled to the pond to have a fun time.
One day, a spoiled monkey named Pat decided to come to the pond. He noticed that the pond was full of frogs and thought it was a perfect time to win a game. He said to the frogs "Whoever can jump the highest, is the winner!" 
The frogs all tried to jump as high as they could, but Pat just laughed. He simply jumped higher than the other frogs, and won the game. 
The other animals were not happy. The squirrel said, "Pat, that was not fair. You did not play the game right! Just because you can jump higher, doesn't mean you should be mean". 
Pat realized that his actions had been wrong. He apologized to the other animals and promised to always be fair in games. 
Moral of the story: It is wrong to be spoiled and to not play games fairly.
