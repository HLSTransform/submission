Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was very happy and cheerful, always smiling and laughing. One day, Lily's mom told her it was time to take a bath. Lily didn't want to take a bath because she was having too much fun playing with her toys. 
"Come on, Lily. It's time to take a bath," said her mom.
Lily shrugged her shoulders and said, "I don't want to go to the bathroom."
"But you need to take a bath so you can be clean," her mom replied.
Lily thought about it for a moment and then said, "Okay, I'll take a bath. But can I bring my toys with me?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course you can, Lily. Let's go to the bathroom and get you cleaned up." 
Lily happily went to the bathroom with her toys and took a nice, warm bath. She felt much better and was glad she listened to her mom.
