Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest, there lived a little squirrel named Sam. Sam loved to play the drum. Every day, he would find a big log and tap on it with sticks.
One sunny day, Sam met a bird named Bella. Bella liked to sing. Sam and Bella decided to play and sing together. "Let's record our song!" said Sam. Bella agreed, and they found a way to save their song.
Sam played his drum, and Bella sang her song. They played and sang all day long. The other animals came to listen and dance to their music. Sam and Bella were so happy to share their gift with their friends.
