Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a gray cat named Mittens. One day, Lily's mom gave her a quiz to see if she knew her colors. "What color is the sky?" her mom asked. "Blue!" Lily answered.
Then, Lily's mom said, "What colors include the rainbow?" Lily thought for a moment and said, "Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple!" Her mom was so proud of her.
Later that day, Lily was playing with Mittens when she noticed he had a gray spot on his fur. "Mittens, you have a gray spot!" she exclaimed. Mittens meowed in response, happy to be playing with Lily.
