Once there was a fox who lived in a yard. He was very happy there because it was safe. Every day he liked to play and zip around the yard. The fox loved to zip around the plants and trees, and sometimes he even zipped around his friends!
One day, he asked his friends if they wanted to go on an adventure. Everyone was so excited, but they couldn't go far because the yard was so safe. Every time they wanted to explore, the fox would zip around and help them find new places to explore.
After a few weeks of exploring, the fox and his friends had seen everything in the yard. But they were still having fun! The fox and his friends would even race to see who could zip around the yard the fastest.
At the end of the day, the fox and his friends would be nice and tired, but they had so much fun zipping around the yard together. They knew that as long as they stayed safe, they would always have a great time playing together.
