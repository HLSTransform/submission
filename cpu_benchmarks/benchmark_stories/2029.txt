Once upon a time there was a team of special people. They made sure that things that were broken got fixed. That was their job - to repair them. 
One day, the team heard about a mysterious broken thing in a far away place. So they got their tools, hopped on a big truck, and went to the mysterious place.
When the team arrived, the broken thing was very big. But the team wasn't scared. They smiled and said "Let's fix it!" 
So they worked together, with their tools and special parts. They worked hard until finally the mysterious thing was repaired. 
The team cheered and said goodbye to the mysterious place. They knew they had done a very good job.
