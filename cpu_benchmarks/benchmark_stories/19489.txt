One day, Susy went to a park to search for something fun to do. She walked around until she found a big bush. She was excited and started to look around it.
Susy pulled out some leaves and noticed that the bush was very wet. She wondered what she could find and started to search around it. She moved some branches and saw a strange bug underneath them.
Susy was very excited and touched the bug. It wiggled and flew away fast. She laughed and kept searching the bush. After a few minutes, she found a bright red flower! She pulled it out from the bush and it was very wet.
Susy smiled, happy that she had something to bring home. She grabbed the flower and ran back home.
