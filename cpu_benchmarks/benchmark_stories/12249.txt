Once upon a time there was a little boy called Jack. He was swinging on his swing in the garden. He was very excited to try and swing as high as he could.
Suddenly, his Mum came outside with a very special present for Jack. It was a bright red pedal car. Jack couldn't believe it, he was so happy. He couldn't wait to try it out.
Jack jumped in the car and started to pedal. He was trying his best to make the car move. After a few tries, he succeeded, and soon he was driving all around the garden.
Jack was having so much fun and his Mum was so proud. All of a sudden, a grumpy buzzing bee started flying around his head. He got so scared, he started to cry.
But Jack's Mum was so brave. She waved her arms around and shooed the bee away. Jack was so relieved and kept pedaling around the garden with a big smile on his face.
