Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going on picnics with her family. Her mommy always made her a big sandwich with lots of cheese and ham. Lily liked to sit on a blanket and eat her sandwich while feeling the warm sun on her face.
One day, Lily's mommy packed a very special sandwich. It was so big and generous that Lily could hardly hold it with both hands. She was so excited to eat it! But as they walked to their picnic spot, Lily accidentally dropped her sandwich in the sand. She was so sad and didn't know what to do.
But then, her daddy had an idea. He took a seat on the blanket and started to dig in the sand. After a few minutes, he found Lily's sandwich! It was a little sandy, but still so delicious. Lily was so happy and grateful to her daddy for being so generous and helping her find her sandwich. From that day on, Lily always made sure to hold her sandwich tightly and not drop it in the sand again.
