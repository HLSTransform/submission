Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy had a red bike with a big wheel in the front. He loved to ride his bike all around the park, but today he was feeling restless. 
As Timmy rode his bike, he saw a big dog who started to bark loudly. The dog scared Timmy, so he yelled for help. His mom heard him and came running over to see what was wrong. 
Timmy's mom saw the big dog and told him to stay still. She went over to the dog and petted him gently. The dog stopped barking and Timmy felt much better. He got back on his bike and rode around the park, feeling happy and safe.
