Once upon a time there was a little girl called Jane. Jane loved to play hockey and she was very independent. One day she got a great idea - she gathered all her hockey sticks and scattered them around the garden. 
Jane was very excited, she enjoyed chasing and collecting her sticks. But soon Jane started to get tired, she just couldn't keep up with all the sticks. When it seemed she had lost all of them, she started to cry.
Suddenly, she spotted her dad in the garden and she ran to him. Jane asked her dad to help her find her hockey sticks. Her dad smiled and said, “Let’s do it together, my darling. We will find them much quicker in a team.”
So Jane’s dad and Jane worked together and soon they found all the hockey sticks. Jane learned a valuable lesson that day: anything can be easy when you work together with somebody you love.
