Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite teddy bear named Mr. Snuggles. One day, Lily wanted to take Mr. Snuggles on an adventure, so she packed a bag and headed to the park.
When they arrived, Lily saw a big tree with a swing tied to it. She wanted to swing, but Mr. Snuggles was feeling uncomfortable in her bag. So, she took him out and put him in a cozy chamber she made with a blanket.
After swinging for a while, Lily noticed her shoelaces were untied. She stopped and asked her mom to tie them for her. Then, she continued to swing with Mr. Snuggles, feeling happy and content.
