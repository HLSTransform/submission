Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw many animals there. They saw ducks, rabbits, goats and deer. Lily liked the deer best. They had brown fur and big eyes. They ate grass and leaves.
"Mom, can I hold a deer?" Lily asked.
Mom smiled. "No, dear, you can't hold a deer. They are wild animals. They might be scared of you. You can look at them and talk to them, but don't touch them."
Lily nodded. She walked closer to the fence. She saw a baby deer. It was smaller than the others. It looked at Lily with curiosity.
"Hello, baby deer," Lily said softly. "You are very cute. I wish I could hold you. But Mom says no. Do you have a name?"
The baby deer tilted its head. It made a soft sound. It seemed to like Lily.
Ben came over. He had a bag of popcorn. He wanted to feed the animals.
"Look, Lily, I have popcorn. Do you want some?" Ben asked.
Lily shook her head. "No, thank you, Ben. I'm talking to the baby deer. It's my friend."
Ben shrugged. He opened the bag and threw some popcorn to the goats. The goats ran to get it. They made loud noises.
The baby deer was startled. It ran away from the fence. It joined its mother.
Lily was sad. She wanted to talk to the baby deer more. She looked at Ben. He was still feeding the goats.
"Ben, you scared the baby deer. It ran away. Why did you do that?" Lily asked.
Ben looked at Lily. He frowned. "I didn't mean to scare it. I just wanted to feed the animals. Popcorn is cheap. Mom bought it for me. It's fun to feed the animals. They like it."
Lily sighed. She didn't think popcorn was good for the animals. She thought they liked grass and leaves better. She wished Ben would be more careful.
"Ben, popcorn is not good for the animals. It's cheap, but it's not healthy. They might get sick. And you should be quiet. The animals don't like loud noises. They like gentle voices. Like mine."
Ben rolled his eyes. He thought Lily was bossy. He liked popcorn. He liked loud noises. He liked fun.
"Lily, you are boring. You don't know how to have fun. You just want to hold the deer. But you can't. Mom said so. You should try something else. Like the slide. Or the swings. Or the sandbox."
Lily shook her head. She didn't want to try something else. She wanted to see the baby deer again. She hoped it would come back. She hoped it would remember her. She hoped it would be her friend.
