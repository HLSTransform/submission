Tim and Sue were friends. They liked to play with their toys in the park. One day, they saw a big bag near a bench. They were curious. They went to look at the bag.
"Wow, look at all these shiny things!" Tim said. He took out a necklace and a ring. "They are so pretty!"
"Maybe they belong to someone," Sue said. She was worried. "We should not touch them."
But Tim did not listen. He put the necklace around his neck and the ring on his finger. He felt happy. He wanted to keep them.
Suddenly, a man came running to the bench. He was angry. He was the thief who stole the shiny things from a shop. He saw Tim and Sue with his bag.
"Hey, you little rats! Give me back my stuff!" he shouted. He grabbed the bag and pulled the necklace and the ring from Tim. He pushed Tim and Sue to the ground. He ran away with his bag.
Tim and Sue were hurt and scared. They cried. They prayed for someone to help them. But no one came. They were alone in the park. They had no toys. They had no friends. They had nothing.
They learned a hard lesson. They should not touch things that are not theirs. They should not be greedy. They should not be stupid.
