Once upon a time, there was a cute dog named Spot. Spot loved to help his friend, Max. Max was a little boy who always had fun with Spot. One day, Max found a big book called a dictionary. Max wanted to learn new words from the dictionary.
Max said to Spot, "Let's look at this big book and learn new words. You can help me!" Spot was happy to help Max. They sat down together and opened the dictionary. Max read the words out loud, and Spot listened carefully.
As Max and Spot were learning, they heard a loud noise outside. They went to see what it was. A big truck had hit their house! The house was broken, and Max and Spot were very sad. They couldn't read the dictionary anymore. The end.
