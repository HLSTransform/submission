Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was quite different from any other boy. He loved to repeat things. Every morning he would repeat, "Good morning sunshine!" He would always repeat what his mom said to him and his friends.
One day he was walking around the park when he came across a bird. The bird said, "Hello, young boy. What's your name?" The boy happily repeated his name back to the bird. The bird said, "It sure is nice to meet you." Again, the boy repeated the words.
The bird and the boy talked for a while and they soon became friends. Every day they would see each other and the boy would always repeat the bird's words. In this way, the boy and the bird became good friends and had lots of fun together.
