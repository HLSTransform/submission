Tom and Lily were playing in the woods. They liked to look for bugs and flowers and sticks. They saw a big log that was lying on the ground. It looked like a good place to hide.
"Let's go inside the log," Tom said. "Maybe we can find some animals."
"OK," Lily said. "But be careful. It might be dark and scary."
They crawled into the log. It was dark and cold and wet. They could hear noises and feel things moving.
"Tom, I don't like it here," Lily said. "Let's go back."
But Tom wanted to see more. He shone a light from his toy flashlight. He saw something shiny and round. He reached for it.
"Look, Lily, I found a treasure!" he said.
But it was not a treasure. It was a snake. A big, angry snake. It hissed and coiled and snapped at Tom.
Tom screamed. Lily screamed. They turned around and ran out of the log. The snake followed them.
"Help, help!" they cried. "There's a snake in the log!"
Their mom heard them and came running. She saw the snake and grabbed a stick. She hit the snake and scared it away.
"Are you OK, kids?" she asked. "What were you doing in the log?"
"We were looking for animals," Tom said. "But we found a snake. It was not fun."
"I'm sorry, Tom," mom said. "But you should never go into a log without me. It can be dangerous. You don't know what might be inside."
She hugged them and took them home. She gave them cookies and milk and a band-aid for Tom's scratch.
They learned their lesson. They never went into a log again. They played with safer things. Like bugs and flowers and sticks.
