Once upon a time, there was a little duck. The duck loved to swim in the pond all day long. One day, the duck saw a shiny key and tried to pick it up with his beak. But the key was too big for the duck's beak, so he asked his friends for help. 
His friends tried to help but they couldn't unlock the box with the key. The duck felt very serious and worried. Then, an old wise owl came to help. The owl told the duck that sometimes it's better to ask for help from someone who knows more than you do. 
The duck learned that it's okay to ask for help and that it's important to keep trying even if things are hard. And from that day on, the duck swam happily in the pond with his friends, knowing that he could always ask for help when he needed it.
