Once upon a time, a curious 3 year-old boy named Jack was walking in the woods. As he was walking, he spotted a volcano in the distance. Jack was very confused but excited to see it. He started to approach it but stopped when he noticed the volcano was spraying smoke out of it. Jack was scared he might get burned, but he wanted to get a closer look.
He slowly stepped closer, and saw yellow and orange sparks coming out. He jumped back, confused and scared. He kept his distance and watched as the volcano kept spraying sparks. After a few seconds, the sparks faded and Jack was even more confused.
Jack eventually braved up and stepped closer to the volcano. He saw an area around the volcano with wilted plants and black rocks. He realized the volcano must have been spraying heat and was surprised at how powerful it was. After a few minutes of exploring, Jack walked away with a renewed sense of curiosity and wonder.
