Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a big pocket in his pants. He loved to put things in his pocket, like rocks and sticks. One day, Tim went to the park to play. He found a shiny toy car on the ground and put it in his pocket. 
Tim played with the toy car for a while, but then he got tired. He wanted to go home, but he didn't want to leave the toy car at the park. So, he took it out of his pocket and put it on a bench. He knew someone else would find it and play with it too. 
When Tim got home, his mom asked him how his day was. Tim said it was mild, which meant it was not too hot or too cold. He also told her about the toy car he found and how he decided to part with it so someone else could enjoy it too. Tim's mom was proud of him for being kind and thoughtful.
