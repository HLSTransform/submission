Once upon a time, there was a small boy named John. John wanted to go on an adventure. He stepped out of his house and started walking. He went through the big park and saw some birds singing in the trees. He stepped through the grass and felt the sun on his face.
John wanted to go somewhere quieter. He started walking and soon came to a lake. He stepped carefully on the rocks so as not to make too much noise. At the lake, he saw some helpful ducks swimming around. He waved at them and they waved back.
John had a lovely time by the lake. The quiet was very peaceful and he enjoyed taking some time to relax. He looked up at the sky and watched the clouds. Eventually, he felt ready to go back home. 
John thanked the ducks for being so helpful. As he stepped back through the park, he knew he had made a wonderful journey. He was excited to share his adventure with his family that night.
