One day, a bright fisherman wandered to a nearby lake. He had a bright yellow fishing rod and lots of fun fishing gear. He was looking for something special this day. 
The fisherman clumsily waded into the water, dropping his tackle box in the process. He carefully picked it back up and moved closer to the center of the lake.
As the fisherman moved further away, his bright yellow hat began to glow in the sunshine. Suddenly, he spotted a bright orange fish swimming around in the water below him. 
The fisherment quickly dropped his rod and began to wave it around in the water. He spun the rod around and around until it was just right. He watched as the bright orange fish grabbed onto the hook at the end of the line.
The fisherman smiled and scooped the fish out of the lake. He admired its bright orange scales, and proudly brought it back home. 
Thanks to the fisherman's wanderings, the lake would now be swimming with bright new fish.
