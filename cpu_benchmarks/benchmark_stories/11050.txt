Tim and Mia like to play with their toys. They have many toys, but their favorite is a robot. The robot can talk and move and make funny sounds. Tim and Mia call him Robby.
One day, Tim and Mia are playing with Robby in their room. They make him walk and dance and sing. They are very happy. But then, their mom comes in and says, "Time to clean up, kids. Put your toys away and get ready for dinner."
Tim and Mia do not want to stop playing. They say, "No, mom. We want to play more. Robby is fun."
Mom says, "You can play later, after dinner. But now you have to tidy up. Robby is fragile. He can break if you leave him on the floor."
Tim and Mia resist. They say, "No, mom. Robby is strong. He can not break. He is our friend."
Mom says, "I know, but he is still a toy. And toys need to be taken care of. Come on, help me put him in his box. He will be safe there."
Tim and Mia look at Robby. He looks at them and says, "I am your friend. But I also need to rest. Please put me in my box. I will wait for you."
Tim and Mia feel sad. They love Robby. But they also love their mom. They decide to listen to her. They hug Robby and say, "Bye, Robby. We will play with you later. We love you."
They put Robby in his box and help mom clean up. Mom smiles and says, "Thank you, kids. You are very good. Now let's go have dinner."
Tim and Mia nod and follow mom. They are hungry. They think about Robby and hope he is not lonely. They promise to play with him again soon.
