Once upon a time, there was a big blueberry. The blueberry lived in a forest. The blueberry was very happy. One day, a little bird came to the forest. The bird was hungry and wanted to eat the blueberry.
The blueberry did not want to be eaten. It became angry. The bird tried to eat the blueberry, but the blueberry yelled, "No!" The bird was scared and flew away.
Later, the bird came back with a friend. They both wanted to eat the blueberry. The blueberry yawned and said, "I am too big for you to eat." The birds thought about it and decided the blueberry was right. They became friends and played in the forest together.
