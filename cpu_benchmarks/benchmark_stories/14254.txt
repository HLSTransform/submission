The jolly little girl spread the box open carefully. Inside was something special. It was a jar of strawberry jam! She could hardly wait to eat it and her stomach started to rumble with anticipation. 
The jam tasted even sweeter than she had imagined and she smeared it over her toast eagerly.  She spread it so thick it covered the whole slice! She licked the last bit off her fingers before giving a big smile of satisfaction. 
The strawberry jam had made her so jolly. Her tummy was now full, and she curled up in her warm bed for a well-earned nap.
