Once upon a time, there was a mom and her little girl. The little girl was very excited when she heard that they were going to have a picnic.
Mommy opened the basket and inside there was a bottle of light wine. She said, "Let's throw it in the air and it will be fun." The little girl knew it would be fun and she wanted to try it.
Mommy threw the wine up in the air and it flew really high. The little girl was so amazed and jumped up and down with glee.
When the bottle came down, Mommy said, "Catch it." The little girl ran and caught the bottle before it hit the ground.
The little girl was so proud and excited to have caught the bottle of light wine. Mommy was happy too, because she knew that the picnic would be even more fun now. They both enjoyed the rest of their picnic together.
