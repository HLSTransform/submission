Once upon a time, there was a carpenter called Jack who had a special screw. He needed to perfect it, so he could use it for his job. 
One day, Jack went to his friend John's house to show him the screw. Jack asked, "Can you help me perfect it?" 
John nodded and said, "Sure! I have just the tool you need." He retrieved a file and started to work on the screw. He was very careful, filing away until the screw looked perfect. 
Suddenly, he handed the screw back to Jack and said, "It's ready to go. I'm sure it will pass the test!" 
Jack thanked John and took the perfect screw back home. He was so happy that his special screw was now perfect. 
The End.
