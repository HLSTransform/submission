Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a toy, a very special thing. This thing was her best friend. They played together every day. Amy always took good care of her special thing.
One day, a boy named Tim came to play with Amy. Tim was a little tough. He didn't know how to play nicely. Tim wanted to play with Amy's special thing, but Amy was scared he would spoil it.
Amy told Tim, "Please be nice to my special thing. I don't want it to spoil." Tim listened to Amy and tried to be more gentle. They played together with the special thing, and it didn't spoil. Amy and Tim became friends, and they learned to play nicely with each other.
