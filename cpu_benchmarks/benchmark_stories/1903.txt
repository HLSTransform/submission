Once upon a time there was a little boy named Dave. He liked to dig in the garden with his spade. One day, he was poking the ground with his spade, looking for worms.
Suddenly, Dave felt something soft and squishy. He poked harder and out of the soil came a big juicy strawberry! "Wow!" he said. "It looks very tasty!"
Dave picked the strawberry up and took a bite. He chewed it slowly and smiled. It was so yummy!
Just then, he heard his mom calling him.
"Dave, come here," said Mom. "I need some help picking some tomatoes."
Dave nodded and put down his spade. He grabbed the strawberry and took one last bite before running back to his mom.
It had been a great day in the garden!
