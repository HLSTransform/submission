Once upon a time there was a little girl named Grace who loved to be active. Everyday she would run around outside and play with her friends.
One day her mommy said to her, "Grace, why don't you try something new? How about yoga?" Grace was not sure what yoga was, so her mommy explained, "Yoga is a way to stay fit and have fun at the same time!" So Grace decided to give it a try.
They went to the yoga studio and found the class already in progress. Everyone was so lively and having a good time. Grace did her best to follow the instructor, but she had a hard time keeping up.
After the class was over, her mommy asked, "How did you like yoga, Grace?" Grace said, "It was hard, but I had fun." Her mommy smiled and said, "Yoga is a great way to stay active and fit. Just keep practicing and you'll get better and better."
Grace was very proud that she had tried something new. She learned that if you stay active, you'll stay fit and healthy for life!
