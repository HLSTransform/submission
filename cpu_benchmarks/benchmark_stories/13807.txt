Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. There is a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. Sam and Mia have fun on the slide and the swing. Then they go to the sandbox.
"Look, I found a toy car!" Sam says. He holds up a red car with four wheels.
"Wow, can I see?" Mia asks. She reaches for the car.
"Be careful!" Sam warns. "The car is broken. One wheel is loose. It can fall off."
Mia takes the car gently. She looks at the wheel. She tries to fix it. But the wheel falls off. Mia is sad.
"I'm sorry, Sam. I broke your car more," Mia says.
"It's okay, Mia. It was already broken. Maybe we can find another toy," Sam says.
He hugs Mia. They are still friends. They look for another toy in the sandbox. They find a yellow ball. They play with the ball. They are happy.
