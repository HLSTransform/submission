Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the grass and feel the sun on her face. One day, she was walking in the park when she saw a big dog. 
"Hello, big dog," said Lily.
"Hello, little girl," said the dog. "What are you doing?"
"I'm playing outside," said Lily. "Do you want to play with me?"
The dog wagged his tail and said, "Yes, I would love to play with you. But be careful, my paws are strong and I don't want to hurt you."
Lily smiled and said, "Don't worry, I'm strong too." They played together for a while until the dog surprised Lily by giving her a big lick on her face. Lily laughed and said, "You're silly, big dog!" They continued to play together and had lots of fun on the ground.
