Mia and Leo were twins who liked to play in the garden. They had a small patch of dirt where they planted seeds and watered them every day. They were very proud of their plants and watched them grow.
One day, they saw some red balls poking out of the ground. They were radishes! Mia and Leo were very happy and ran to pick them. They each took one and held it in their hands.
"Look, Leo, we grew radishes!" Mia said. "They are so pretty and round!"
"Yes, Mia, they are!" Leo said. "And they are tasty too! Let's eat them!"
But before they could bite into their radishes, a big rabbit hopped into the garden. It was lively and fast, and it saw the radishes too. It ran towards Mia and Leo and tried to snatch their radishes from their hands.
"Hey, stop that!" Mia shouted. "These are our radishes! We worked hard to grow them!"
"Go away, rabbit!" Leo yelled. "You can't have our radishes! They are ours!"
The rabbit did not listen. It kept jumping and nibbling at the radishes. Mia and Leo tried to hold on to their radishes, but the rabbit was stronger and smarter. It pulled and tugged and bit until it got both radishes and ran away.
Mia and Leo were very sad and angry. They had lost their radishes and their hard work. They looked at the empty patch of dirt and cried.
"Those were our radishes!" Mia sobbed. "We valued them so much!"
"I know, Mia, I know!" Leo said. "The rabbit was mean and greedy! It did not value our work!"
They hugged each other and wiped their tears. Then they saw something in the dirt. It was another seed. They had planted more than two radishes. There were more seeds waiting to grow.
Mia and Leo smiled and dried their eyes. They decided to plant the seed and water it. They hoped it would grow into a big and beautiful radish. And they hoped the rabbit would not come back.
