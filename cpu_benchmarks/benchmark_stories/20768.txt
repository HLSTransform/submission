Pete was walking down the street when he saw some junk on the sidewalk. He didn't know what it was, but he knew it made him feel uncomfortable. He stopped to take a closer look at it. Suddenly, Pete heard a little voice coming from behind the junk. It was a tiny puppy who had gotten stuck underneath the mess! Pete quickly tried to help the pup out and was eventually able to rescue him. Now that the puppy was safe, Pete knew he had done the right thing. He made sure the puppy was comfortable and put him back down on the sidewalk. Pete watched as the pup ran off, leaving all the junk behind. He felt glad to have helped.
