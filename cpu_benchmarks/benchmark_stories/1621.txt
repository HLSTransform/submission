Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to splash in the pool and make bubbles with the soap. They had a big towel to dry themselves when they were done.
But then, Ben saw a butterfly. He wanted to catch it and see its colors. He ran after it, leaving the towel on the grass. Lily did not see him go. She was busy making a big bubble.
When Lily looked up, she could not find Ben. She called his name, but he did not answer. She felt scared and lonely. She wanted her brother to come back. She wrapped the towel around her and started to cry.
Ben followed the butterfly to the fence. He saw a hole under it. He thought the butterfly went through it. He crawled under the fence and found himself in a dark alley. He did not see the butterfly anymore. He saw a big dog. The dog was angry and barked at him. Ben was afraid and tried to run away. But the dog was faster and bit him. Ben screamed and dropped the towel.
Lily heard Ben scream. She ran to the fence and looked through the hole. She saw the dog and the towel. She did not see Ben. She thought the dog ate him. She was very sad and screamed too. She wanted her brother back. She wanted the dog to disappear. But the dog did not disappear. The dog took the towel and ran away. Lily was left alone in the garden, with no brother and no towel. She cried and cried.
