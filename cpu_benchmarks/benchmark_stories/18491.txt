One day, Tom and Lily went to the farm with their mom. They saw many animals, like cows, pigs, chickens and horses. They liked to feed them and pet them. But there was one animal they did not like. It was a goat.
The goat was smelly and mean. He had horns and a beard. He liked to butt and bite. He did not share his food or his space. He made loud noises and scared the other animals. Tom and Lily stayed away from him.
But then, they saw a little boy who wanted to play with the goat. He did not know how bad the goat was. He ran towards him with a carrot. The goat saw him and got angry. He charged at him with his horns.
"Look out!" Tom shouted. He ran to the boy and pushed him away. The goat missed him and hit a fence. He got stuck and bleated.
"Thank you!" the boy said. He hugged Tom. "You saved me from the smelly goat!"
Lily came too and gave him a smile. "You are brave and kind," she said. "Do you want to play with us?"
The boy nodded. He was happy. He had made new friends.
The goat was sad and lonely. He had no friends. He realized he had been selfish and rude. He wished he had been nicer to the other animals and the children.
The moral of the story is: Be nice and share, or you will end up alone.
