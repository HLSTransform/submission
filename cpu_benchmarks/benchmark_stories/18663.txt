Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and teddy bears. One day, she noticed that her teddy bear had a big hole in its belly. She decided to fix it with a needle and thread. She had to measure the thread first, so it was just the right length. 
Lily carefully stitched up the hole in her teddy bear's belly. She was very proud of herself for fixing it. Later, she went to visit her grandma who was deaf. Lily had to speak loudly and clearly so her grandma could hear her. They played games and had fun together. 
At the end of the day, Lily went to bed with her teddy bear. She hugged it tightly and fell asleep, happy that she had fixed it. From that day on, Lily knew how to measure and stitch things, and she loved spending time with her deaf grandma.
