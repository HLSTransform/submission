Once upon a time, there was a sailor named Joe. Joe was a helpful person. He was always helping his friends and was always happy.
One day, Joe decided to take a long boat ride. He invited all his friends to join him. Everyone was excited and bought snacks for the boat.
As they sailed, a big, loud noise was heard. A dolphin was introducing itself to Joe and his friends! Everyone was so surprised and couldn't contain their laughs.
Joe was so helpful that even the dolphin wanted to be his friend! Everyone on board was delighted.
The moral of the story is that if you are helpful and kind, even the animals will be your friends. Joe's helpful behaviour won the hearts of everyone, and even the dolphin!
