Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to look at the flowers and smell them. Lily saw a big flower that was pink and white. She ran to it and said, "Look, Ben, this flower is so pretty! It is blooming!"
Ben followed her and nodded. He liked the flower too. He touched it gently and said, "It is soft and smooth. And it smells good too. What is its name?"
Lily shrugged. She did not know the name of the flower. She said, "I don't know. Maybe we can ask Mom. She knows a lot of flower names."
They ran to the house and found Mom in the kitchen. They showed her the flower and asked, "Mom, what is this flower called? It is blooming and it is pink and white."
Mom smiled and said, "This flower is called a peony. It is a very special flower. It only blooms for a short time in the spring. You are lucky to see it."
Lily and Ben were happy. They thanked Mom and ran back to the garden. They wanted to see more flowers. They saw yellow ones, blue ones, red ones, and purple ones. They had fun naming them and picking some for Mom.
But then the sky became dark and cloudy. They heard a loud noise. It was thunder. They saw a flash. It was lightning. They felt a drop. It was rain.
They were scared. They did not like the dark and the noise and the wet. They ran to the house again. They were wet and muddy. Their pants were dirty. They said, "Mom, Mom, we are sorry. We made a mess. The sky is dark and scary. Can we come in?"
Mom hugged them and said, "Don't worry, my loves. You are not in trouble. You can come in and change your pants. The rain will stop soon. And then you can see a rainbow. A rainbow is a very beautiful thing. It has many colors, like the flowers. Do you want to see a rainbow?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They wanted to see a rainbow. They changed their pants and waited for the rain to stop. They hoped the flowers would still be blooming. They hoped the sky would be bright again. They hoped to see a rainbow.
