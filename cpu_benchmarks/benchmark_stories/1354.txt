Mommy and Sammy were walking to the park. Suddenly, Sammy saw a big, yummy horse. He screamed "horse, horse!". Mommy said "Do you want to pet the horse Sammy? Please be careful, ok?". Sammy nodded and said "please horse". He was so excited he ran over to the horse. The horse made a friendly noise and Sammy patted it's neck. He said "yummy".
Mommy smiled and said "Let's go get ice cream Sammy, would you like that?". Sammy nodded as he followed mommy away from the horse. He said "yummy horse, please mommy!"
