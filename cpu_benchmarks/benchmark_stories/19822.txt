Once upon a time, there was a robot who was very miserable. He didn't have any friends and no one to play with. He felt very lonely. 
One day, he decided to go for a walk to try and find someone to talk to. He was walking along and he was feeling very sad when he suddenly heard a loud noise. 
He looked up and saw a family of birds rushing across the sky. The robot was very excited to have seen something so interesting. He began to rush after the birds, hoping to catch up with them. 
But the birds flew away too quickly and the robot couldn't keep up. He let out a big sigh and continued walking, feeling even more miserable than before. Suddenly, he heard someone calling out to him. 
It was a small child who was only three years old. She motioned for the robot to come over and the robot happily followed her. 
The little girl had a big smile on her face and she showed the robot all the fun things she had been playing with. The robot smiled back and for the first time in a long time he felt happy.
