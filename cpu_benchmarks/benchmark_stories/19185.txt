Once upon a time, there was a shy dog named Spot. Spot was always frowning because he was too scared to play with other dogs. He would watch them run and jump, but he would just sit by a big tire and feel sad.
One day, a little girl named Sue saw Spot by the tire. Sue wanted to be friends with Spot, so she walked up to him. Spot was scared, but Sue was kind. She patted him and said, "Don't frown, Spot. Let's play together!" Spot felt a little better, but he was still shy.
Sue tried to get Spot to play with her and the other dogs, but Spot was too scared. He stayed by the tire, frowning. Sue had to go home, and the other dogs went away too. Spot was left all alone by the tire, feeling sad and shy.
