Once upon a time, a little boy named Timmy went for a walk in the forest. He saw a turkey walking around. The turkey was harmless and didn't hurt anyone. Timmy loved animals, so he followed the turkey to see where it was going. 
Suddenly, the turkey sprang up into a tree! Timmy was surprised and amazed. He had never seen a turkey do that before. The turkey looked down at Timmy and made a funny noise. Timmy laughed and waved at the turkey. 
After a while, the turkey climbed back down and continued walking. Timmy decided to go home and tell his mommy about the turkey that sprang up into a tree. From that day on, Timmy loved turkeys even more because he knew they could do cool things like spring up into trees.
