Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lily. She was out exploring in the woods when she spotted something on the ground. She looked closer and saw that it was a skull! She was scared and upset. She ran back home as fast as her tiny legs could carry her. 
When she got home, Lily told her mom about the skull. Her mom said it was probably from an animal, but Lily didn't feel better. She was still scared and upset so her mom hugged her and said that everything was going to be ok.
But Lily was still worried, so her mom asked her if they should go back and take a look. That way, Lily could see if anything bad was happening. She agreed, so they put on their shoes and went back to the woods.
When they arrived, Lily looked around to make sure everything was ok. She didn't see anything scary and soon she felt better. She even smiled when she saw how the sun was shining through the trees. It was a beautiful day!
Lily and her mom continued to explore the woods, until they had to go home. Lily said goodbye to her skull friend, feeling much better than when she had arrived.
