Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in the sun. But one day, it was too hot and she got very thirsty. She saw a big tree with a shade and went to sit under it. 
Suddenly, she heard a little bird singing. She peeked up and saw the bird's nest in the tree. She wanted to touch the nest, but her mommy had told her not to touch it. 
Lily realized that sometimes it's important to listen to grown-ups, even if we want to do something else. She felt a little bit cold under the shade, so she went back home and drank some cold water. From that day on, she always remembered to listen to her mommy and daddy.
