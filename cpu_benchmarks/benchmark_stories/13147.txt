Once upon a time, there was a loyal boy named Jack. He had a special pipe, which he liked to play with. One day, he decided to take it outside. He ran around in the sun and played with it.
Suddenly, he heard something. It sounded like thunder. He looked up and saw a fierce storm. He started to shake and he hid behind a tree. As he stood, he saw a lightning bolt strike the ground. It made a loud noise and put a hole in the ground.
Jack was scared, but he was brave. He picked up his pipe and walked closer to see what happened. He saw that the lightning had struck a pipe. He was loyal to it and decided to take it home. He wrapped it in a blanket and ran home to keep it safe. 
He showed it to his mom and dad and told them what happened. He was proud that he had been so loyal to the pipe. They told him he was brave, and from that day on Jack knew he could protect what was important to him.
