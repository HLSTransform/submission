Once upon a time, there was a good painter. He painted pictures with many colors. He had a dog named Spot who was always with him. Spot was a loyal dog who never left the painter's side.
One day, the painter went out to buy more paint. Spot wanted to come with him, but the painter said no. Spot was sad, but he stayed home. While the painter was gone, Spot saw a cat outside. The cat was very mean and scratched Spot.
When the painter came back, he saw that Spot was hurt. He was angry at the cat for hurting his loyal dog. He decided to punish the cat by chasing it away. Spot was happy that the painter protected him. From then on, Spot never left the painter's side again.
