Once upon a time, there was a hot day. A little girl sneezed and said, "I need a mint." Then she went on an adventure to find a mint.
The little girl searched in the garden and the kitchen, but the mint was nowhere to be found. Then she started to get tired and thought, "Maybe I should take a nap."
So she found a nice spot in the sunshine and curled up for a nap. She was dreaming of minty treats when she felt something tickling her nose.
She opened her eyes, and right next to her was a big pile of mints. There must have been a thousand of them! The little girl smiled, and then ate a mint. It was cold and sweet, just like she had hoped.
The little girl was so happy that she had found all these mints to enjoy. She stayed outside in the sunshine until she got too hot, and then she took another nap.
