Once upon a time, there was a big cow named Betsy. Betsy loved to eat grass all day and sleep in the sun. But one day, Betsy woke up early because she heard a loud noise. She looked around and saw a group of cows playing a game.
The game was called the competitive mooing game. The cows took turns mooing as loud as they could. Betsy wanted to join in, but she was nervous. She had never been competitive before.
Betsy practiced her mooing all day and all night. She wanted to be the best cow in the game. Finally, the day of the game arrived. Betsy was nervous, but she took a deep breath and gave the loudest moo of all.
The other cows were impressed, but one cow was not happy. This cow had always been the best at the game, but now Betsy had taken the title. The cow was angry and wanted revenge. But Betsy didn't care, she was just happy to have tried something new and had fun.
