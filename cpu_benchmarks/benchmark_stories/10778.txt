Once upon a time, in a messy room, lived a little girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to sort her toys and eat mint candies. One day, her mom came into her room and said, "Lucy, your room is very messy. Can you sort your toys and clean up?"
Lucy looked around her room and said, "Yes, Mom. I will sort my toys and make my room clean." So, Lucy started to sort her toys. She put her dolls in one box, her cars in another box, and her blocks in a third box. 
While Lucy was sorting her toys, she found a mint candy under her bed. She was very happy and said, "Yummy! I found a mint candy!" Lucy ate the mint candy, finished sorting her toys, and her room was clean. Her mom came back into the room and said, "Good job, Lucy! Your room looks nice and clean now." Lucy smiled and said, "Thank you, Mom. I love sorting my toys and finding mint candies!"
