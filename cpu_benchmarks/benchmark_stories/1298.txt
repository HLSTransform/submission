Once upon a time, there was a girl named Abbie. She was three years old. Abbie was very curious. Everywhere she went, she wanted to learn more and try new things. But there was one thing Abbie hated — weight. All the other kids were playing and having fun, while Abbie had to stand still and hold the weight in her hands.
But one day, Abbie's mom told her a secret. She said that when Abbie started to do her exercises, the weight would feel lighter. Abbie started to do what her mom said and soon enough, she found that the weight was much easier to carry.
Abbie was so happy! She carried the weight around the house and even did her exercises with a smile on her face. From then on, Abbie didn't hate the weight anymore — she was in control of it.
