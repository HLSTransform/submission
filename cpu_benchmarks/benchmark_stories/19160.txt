One day, a creative cat named Sam saw a sack. He wanted to take a look inside. But, a big dog named Max saw the sack too. Max said, "I want to look in the sack!"
Sam and Max did not want to share. They both wanted to look in the sack alone. They began to fight. They pushed and pulled the sack. The sack ripped open! Out came many colorful balls. The balls rolled away.
Sam and Max felt sad. They learned that they should share. If they shared, they could have played with the colorful balls together. Now, they had no balls to play with. Sharing is good.
