Once upon a time there was a dark night. Everyone in the house was quiet. Everything was calm and peaceful. But then, all of a sudden, there was a loud yell.
It was coming from outside. The little boy was scared! He ran to get his mom. She heard the loud yell too. She hugged the little boy and said, "It's okay. Let's go see what made that sound."
So, they went outside with the flashlight. They looked all around, but no one was there. Mommy said, "We better get back inside. It's dark out here."
Once they got back inside, the house was quiet again. Mommy said, "You just heard an animal yell. Some animals like to yell at night and it can be a little scary. But, it's okay." 
The little boy felt brave and smiled. Then, he snuggled up with his mom and fell asleep feeling safe.
