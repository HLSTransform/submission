Once upon a time there was a monkey named Tom who lived in a big jungle. Tom had a lot of friends, but the other animals were always jealous of him.
One day, Tom decided to go for a walk and soon he saw a mean-looking animal. "Who are you?" asked Tom. The animal did not answer but just growled and snarled at him. Tom was scared and ran away.
The next day, Tom and his friends ventured into the same part of the jungle and they all heard a loud, harsh noise coming from that same spot. "What can that be?" asked Tom.
When they finally reached the spot, they saw the same mean animal. But this time, the animal was sitting in front of a group of frightened, crying little monkeys. Tom soon realised that the harsh noise they heard was actually the mean animal's attempts to scare away the little monkeys.
Tom and his friends decided to help the little monkeys. Tom bravely went to the mean animal and told him to leave the little monkeys alone. The mean animal realised he had been defeated and quickly left the scene.
Tom and his friends had saved the day. They taught the little monkeys not to be scared and to stand up for themselves. They also taught them that if you are brave and kind, mean animals will always be defeated.
