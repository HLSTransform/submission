Once upon a time there lived a fierce little girl named Emma. She was always full of energy and excitement. Emma had a favorite jacket with a zipper on it. Whenever she wore that jacket she felt very special.
One day, Emma and her family were getting ready to celebrate. She put on her favorite jacket and twirled around.
"I look fierce in this jacket," she said, smiling.
Her mom smiled back and said, "You look so cute! Celebrate today and have lots of fun."
So Emma went off to celebrate with glee, feeling very proud of her special zipper jacket. And to this day, she still enjoys celebrating in her special zipper jacket.
