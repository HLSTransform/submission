Once upon a time, there was a girl called Bobbi. She was very excited, because today it was her birthday. She was wearing a pretty dress and a party hat.
Bobbi's friends came over to celebrate with her. They brought lots of presents and sweet treats for her. However, when the time came for her to blow out the candles on her cake, her father said no! His voice was harsh, and he said that Bobbi was too young.
Bobbi was sad, but she resisted. She wouldn't be able to live without blowing out the candles on her birthday. So she kept on trying, until her father finally said yes.
Everyone cheered when Bobbi made a wish and finally blew out the candles. It was a happy day, and Bobbi never wanted it to end!
