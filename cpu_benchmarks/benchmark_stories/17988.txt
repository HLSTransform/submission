Once upon a time, in a large garden, there was a beautiful rose. The rose was very big and red. All the kids loved the rose because it was so pretty.
One day, a little boy came to the garden. He saw the large rose and wanted it for himself. He said, "I want this rose!" This was his way of demanding the rose. The other kids did not like this.
The kids told the little boy, "We all love the rose, but we do not take it. We just look at it and enjoy it." The little boy thought about it and decided to do the same. He did not demand the rose anymore.
From that day on, the little boy and the other kids played in the garden and enjoyed the large rose together. They learned that some things are better when shared with others.
